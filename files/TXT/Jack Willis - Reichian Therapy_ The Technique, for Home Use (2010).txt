CHAPTER 1

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE WORK

GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE WORK

Part One of the book consists of a general discussion, the 
exercises to do each day and an explanation of proper breathing 
to go with the work. Part Two of the book covers each of the 
areas of the body from the forehead to the legs. 

HOW TO READ THIS BOOK

Each issue covered will be set out in a box. The box will 
appear before the detailed discussion. You can quickly get a 
general idea or the material by just reading what is in the boxes or 
you can use the boxes as a way to review. 

There will be two types of boxes. A major box is shown as

Major boxes will cover an area of information.
A minor box is shown as: 

Minor boxes will provide a preview summary of the material 
discussed subsequently in detail.



2 Reichian technique, Part One     
Occasionally I have a point that I want to emphasize. That 

does not mean the point is more important, it means that if you 
keep it in mind it will help a great deal with your work. An 
emphasis point will be shown as:

In learning all these exercises (in doing this work) I would 
suggest that you first just read through both parts of the book to 
get an overall idea of the possible extent of the work. This read 
will be rather daunting in that it will seem to present so much 
material that it will be impossible for you ever to learn it all. 
Don’t worry about that. Just read through to get an overall idea of 
where you are going. Then start again with Chapter two and just 
learn the daily exercises. Spend a week or two just with the daily 
exercises until they are learned and practiced. Then re-read 
Chapters three and four. Now spend as long as it takes you to do 
a half reasonable job with the normal breathing as discussed in 
Chapters three and four. Even though there is then a lot to do 
with the breathing, still once you have at least partially mastered 
Chapters three and four, skip in your work to Chapter 11 and start 
work on your forehead and eyes. 

You’ve been breathing all your life. You know how to 
breathe. What’s the big deal? Wait till you try to breathe 
properly, you’ll see what the big deal is. In any event, get this 
down as well as you think you can and then start with the 

Here is the first special note. After substantially 
mastering Chapters three and four, skip to Chapter 
11 and start to clear up your forehead and eyes. 
This is important.

material in Chapter five. Practice each of the breathing exercises 
there, one at a time in order, until you have learned each of them. 
Many, I can assure you ahead of time, you will not be able to do. 
Don’t let that throw you. The idea at this time — at the beginning 
of the Reichian work that will occupy you for years to come — is 
just to make all these exercises a part of your fund of knowledge. 
In time, as the work progresses, because you have spent some 
time with each of the breathing exercises and made them part of 
your knowledge base, you will be able to use each as it seems 
appropriate in the course of your work.

WHAT IS THIS WORK

It is to be appreciated that Reichian therapy is psychotherapy. 
It is not mysticism, it is not meditation, it is not occult. It is not 
chakras or auras or meridians. It is psychotherapy. The major 
difference in Reichian therapy is that it approaches the 
psychotherapeutic process by working on the body. 

The methods here were first developed by Wilhelm Reich and 
then added to by various practitioners including the author. Since 
Reich did not leave any detailed description of his technique, it is 
not possible to say with confidence which of the exercises 
presented are directly those used by Reich and which were added 
by other practitioners. The author was taught the therapy by 
Francis Regardie who practiced this therapy for over three 
decades. The author has been practicing the therapy for three and 
one half decades and thus this presentation bears the signature of 
over sixty five years of experience.1

This book will not present the theory of body-based 
psychotherapy. That will be the task of a separate book designed 
for the practicing psychotherapist. It is clear that the theory of the 
therapy put forth by Reich is totally mistaken. It is ignored in this 
presentation. For those people who need, for personal reasons, to 
re-introduce Reich’s sexual and/or energy theories into the 
practice, they may do so as they read and perhaps mark up their 
copy of this book.

4 Reichian technique, Part One     
Reichian therapy is a particularly powerful technique of 

therapy. Reichian therapy, by itself, can accomplish things that 
normal verbal therapy can not do. But body-based psychotherapy 
does not supplant or obviate normal verbal therapy. It is still the 
case that insight, self-understanding, is essential to any 
psychotherapeutic process. 

It is by no means required that you be in some form of verbal 
therapy in order to make effective use of these procedures. 
Reichian therapy will do its job whether you are or are not also in 
verbal psychotherapy. But, as I will emphasize repeatedly, this is 
a powerful form of therapy and its power must be respected. I had 
one patient who took what little he had learned as a patient and 
then stopped therapy to do the work on his own at home. When 
he returned, he had done so much harm to himself that I refused 
to take him back into therapy. That story is not meant to scare 
you, it is meant to underscore the power of this approach and thus 
the need to proceed slowly.

A MINOR NOTE ON REPETITION

There is, in this book, a non-trivial amount of repetition. 
Obviously, since I even mention it here, it is deliberate. There are 
some issues which are, in my view, so important that I would 
rather my reader be annoyed by the repetition than the point be 
lost in an otherwise reasonably lengthy book. 

Repetition is annoying, not being aware of an issue can be 
dangerous.

A NOTE ON CHAPTER 23

As you see, this is not a short book. There is a lot to cover and 
I have attempted to supply as much of the technique and theory 
as might be needed for the personal use of this therapy. Chapter 
23 alone is over 100 pages long. By the time you get to Chapter 
23, where I deal with the cognitive work you should do along 
with the body work, there may be a tendency to just skip that 
chapter and stop at the body work. I want to caution against that 
tendency. The cognitive work is essential for the body work to 
have its desired result. I urge you, at least once, to take the time 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        5
to read Chapter 23. You may or may not be willing to undertake 
the more arduous work of observing yourself and using the 
exercises and techniques I provide in Chapter 23, but reading it at 
least once is a worthwhile investment of your time.  

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK?

In two words, it is character change . Ok, so what is 
character? Simply, it is the basic way any given person 
approaches life. 

Here we must look at three words: behavior, personality and 
character. As will become apparent, behavior is an expression of 
personality and personality is an expression of character. 

Behavior is what is observable about a person. 

If you were to see me right now some things would be obvious 
(and unimportant). Obviously I am sitting at my computer and 
typing. Occasionally I stop to consult the manual on this 
particular word processing program. Those are all behaviors, but 
not relevant behaviors. They are all required by the fact that I am 
writing this book.

But there are also important observable behaviors. I am bent 
over rather than sitting up straight. My head is near the computer 
screen rather than being back the usual distance. It is a Sunday 
but instead of playing, watching television or puttering about the 
house, I am writing this book. Classical music is playing in the 
background.

None of these observable behaviors is required. They all are 
expressions of who I am as a person, they are all behaviors that 
are psychologically relevant. Psychologically relevant behavior 
is an expression of and grows out of the personality. 

Personality is the same or similar behavior seen in differ-
ent situations. 

There is a simple example of this. If you are about to give a 
speech or make a presentation before a group and are nervous, 



6 Reichian technique, Part One     
that is a behavior. You have, to a greater or lesser degree, “stage 
fright.”

If, however, in many situations you display nervousness, that 
is a part of your personality. You are a nervous person. To use a 
term from math, we get to personality by summing up like or 
similar behaviors over many situations.

Character is never seen. Character is inferred2.

Charac t e r  i s  t he  bas i c  s t a t emen t  a  pe r son  makes  
(unrecognized) about himself, the world, and the relationship 
between the two. Here are two examples, first a short one — just 
the bare bones — then an extended example. 

A short example:
As a result of various childhood experiences, Jim regards the 

world of people as unpredictable. His implicit statement about 
the world is that you can never really predict what anyone will 
do. His implicit statement about himself is that he is not capable 
of understanding people’s motivations. His character trait is that 
he is rational while other people are irrational; his personality is 
that he is a guarded person; his behavior is that he does not 
readily make friends and even with people he calls his friends, he 
does not tend to call on them to come to his aid in a time of need.

Now for an extended example. 
It is difficult to fully grasp these concepts without the aid of an 

illustration. For that reason, I have created a patient biography to 
illustrate and explain these concepts. To help pick out the 
behaviors, personality and character I have bolded (B) the 

2. Character is an ambiguous word in English. In one instance we 
speak of character rather like integrity as in “he is a man of good 
character.” In another context we speak of character rather like 
different or inconsistent as in “what a character he is.” As the 
word is used here it has no ethical implication. Everyone alive has 
a character. To live is to have a character. Character in this context 
is neither good nor bad, it simply is. It can be analogized to height. 
Everyone is some height. In general tall is better than short, but 
better only because being tall is more rewarded in the culture than 
is being short. 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        7
behaviors, bolded and italicized (P) the personality, and bolded 
and underlined (C) the character.

Betty’s mother regards proper behavior as the hallmark of a 
properly raised child. From an early age, well before Betty has 
any real memory of it — though she knows of it from her 
mother’s proud stories — Betty was trained to say “bye bye”, 
“thank you” and “may I.” Betty was required to eat all the food 
put before her and was not allowed to leave the table before 
requesting and receiving permission. Between meal snacks were 
permitted only if they “would not spoil her appetite.” Dessert was 
permitted only if she ate all her food with the proper speed and 
used the right eating utensils. Posture was important and Betty 
was constantly told to “not slouch.” Clothes had to be clean, had 
to be picked up at night, and had to be placed in the hamper for 
washing. In the morning, Betty’s mother would pick out what she 
was to wear for the day. No disagreement was permitted. One of 
Betty’s earliest memories was when she was taken to the park. 
She sees herself (in her memory) as being on the “jungle jim” 
when her dress rips. She remembers thinking that she must hide it 
from her mother and feeling fear, excitement, and that if she 
could just always turn her back to her mother then her mother 
would not see the rip. Betty soon recognized that what was 
important was how you acted (P). Her father provided a solution.

Betty’s father was a policeman and often had to put in 
overtime. When he did come home, something that could never 
be planned, he was usually tired and non-communicative. Father 
usually stopped at the local policeman’s bar after work — to take 
the edge off as he would say later — and the smell of alcohol on 
his breath was something that Betty took as natural. Given his 
occupation, he was particularly concerned, perhaps even more 
than Betty’s mother, that Betty be well behaved so that she would 
not reflect badly on him. His major and offstated view was that 
good parents had good children and he “would see that she was 
dealt with severely” if she ever got into trouble.

From Betty’s child’s world view, her preferences, likes and 
dislikes, choices, and desires all were either of no consequence 
or were wrong (P). She hated the clothes her mother laid out for 
her, but in time concluded that she must be wrong and had poor 



8 Reichian technique, Part One     
taste in clothes (P). Since her food preferences were ignored and 
since dinner was a distasteful command performance of proper 
behavior and proper eating, she came to dread dinner and to 
regard food as a form of punishment (P). Sleep, too, was a 
contest. She had to be in bed at a certain time with the lights out. 
Believing that her night-time fears would not be acceptable, she 
never told her parents about her fear that some bad man that 
daddy was after would come and hurt her at night to get back at 
daddy. She was fascinated by and at the same time terrified of 
the gun (P) her daddy wore and once she learned from the 
television that policemen killed people, she formed the fear that 
if she were bad that daddy would kill her as he killed other 
people (C). Since both her parents were only concerned with her 
behavior and considered Betty’s own ideas to be of no 
importance, she never told them about any of her fears (B). As 
Betty sought to separate her inner life from her actions, her father 
became her guide and protector. She decided that if she had a 
policeman inside herself then she could not do anything 
wrong because policemen punished people who did things 
wrong (C). Thereafter Betty created an imaginary policeman 
inside herself and had constant inner dialogues with the 
policeman, checking with the policeman at all times before 
she allowed herself to act (C). 

Betty soon stopped trying to form her own judgements (P)
since they were either wrong or would make her desire things 
that she could not have. In time she grew to ignore any desires of 
her own (P)  and simply incorporated all her parent’s 
injunctions of the right way to behave (P). She was the model 
child of decorum (B) and for this she was praised effusively by 
her mother and by her father, when she saw him. She resented 
that she could not spend time with her father but also was glad 
that he was never around because he was just as controlling as 
mother. The first time that she told a schoolmate that her father 
was a policeman, the schoolmate immediately told everyone else. 
Her girl playmates started mildly to shun her because they did not 
want to get in trouble with the policeman and her boy playmates 
started shooting her with their fingers. She decided never to tell 
anyone again what her father did and thereafter learned to lie 
about it (B).  She made up for the loss by expanding the 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        9
policeman inside herself to a whole police station (C).  Initially 
it only had men policeman like her father.  Later she saw on the 
television that there could also be women policemen, so she 
added women officers to her mental police station.  Mainly the 
policemen and women only punished bad people.  Sometimes 
Betty would imagine that the policemen were helping good little 
children who were lost.  But she could never expand on those 
fantasies — they always just ended when the policeman told the 
good child how to get home — and thus her good-child fantasies 
ended soon and she only focused on the bad people that the 
policeman captured (C).  A few times she imagined that the 
policeman would kill the bad person; but she found that these 
fantasies were too emotionally arousing and were thus 
unpleasant, so she stopped them.  To stop her “bad” (that is, 
unpleasant or unsatisfying) fantasies she created a police 
sergeant who controlled what fantasies she was allowed to 
have with the police officers (C).  Effectively, she had created a 
(mental) policeman to control her other (mental) policemen.  

Betty’s religious instruction started when she was three.  She 
was required each night to say her prayers before bed, a ritual her 
mother supervised.   When her unexpressed terror at night 
developed, Betty responded by extending her praying (B), a 
method of putting off the time when the lights were turned off 
and a method of seeking a protector against the man who would 
come in and kill her.  Her mother viewed this behavior initially as 
indicating that Betty was growing up and becoming more 
committed to her Savior but later came to be annoyed by the 
extended time for this ritual and limited Betty to saying her 
prayer three times and no more.  Betty complied by deciding that 
three was a magic number and any more or less would be 
dangerous (P).

Psychosexually, Betty was breast fed on a demand schedule as 
current proper motherly behavior demanded.  But Betty was 
moved to scheduled feeding and then to the bottle as rapidly as 
Betty would permit.  Toilet training was started at 18 months, as 
was socially proper.  The method employed was to put Betty on 
the training toilet for as long as necessary to achieve elimination. 
Betty was not allowed to leave the training toilet until she 
eliminated.  When she “did the right thing”  she was praised 



10 Reichian technique, Part One     
effusively.  Subsequent soiling was met with disapproval and 
disdain.  Nudity was not allowed in the house.  Later, when Betty 
had developed her mental police station, she assigned a special 
policeman — he was called Mr. Dodo Right (a play on words 
from a television show she saw that had a Dudley Doright 
character) — and this policeman’s duty was to see that little 
girls did not make “dodo” in their pants (C).

Betty had plenty of playmates with whom she always played 
“the right way (B).”  For all her toys there was a right way to 
use it and a wrong way (B).  Betty’s mother, and on rare 
occasions her father, always made sure that she was shown the 
right way to play with her toys and playing in the wrong way was 
stopped with “no, Betty, here is how we play with this toy.” 
Betty soon found that her fantasy life was only acceptable when 
it resulted in appropriate behavior (P).  She also discovered that 
she could “day dream (B)” as her mother derisively called it as 
long as she hid the activity (P) from prying adult eyes, which is 
to say that the day dream did not result in any action.   To her 
mother’s and father’s delight and praise, Betty then took to 
spending a lot of time reading (B).  That she did not seem to 
know what she read (because the book was merely something to 
occupy her hands while she lived out her rich fantasy life) was 
soon accepted by her parents as “just the way she is.”  Her 
fantasy life became much more satisfying then her play with 
friends since in her fantasy life the policemen and policewomen 
were her friends and they did not withdraw or shoot her with their 
fingers and she did not have to lie to them (B) She was deeply 
conflicted about lying since telling the truth was right but 
telling the truth to her young friends was emotionally painful 
and thus truth led to pain and lying lead to internal punishment 
which was painful (P).  

As she grew up, she found by watching television and hearing 
her parents speak that sometimes policeman beat up the bad 
people.  After that her fantasies about the mental police force 
grew more elaborate and took on a decidedly violent 
character (C).  She also started to include herself as one of the 
bad people who were beaten by the policemen.  For reasons she 
never could understand, these fantasies were somehow very 
satisfying even though they involved her being beaten.  



Chapter 1, Introduction                        11
At age 13, Betty became more committed to her school 

studies, withdrawing almost entirely from social contact (B). 
While her parents were initially pleased with this devotion to 
school, they soon started to urge her to find “good schoolmates” 
to play with. In time the conflict in the house grew between the 
opposing demands that Betty do well in school and that Betty not 
spend so much time at home alone, that she have more friends. 
By the age of 16, Betty started to cut herself (self-mutilation) 
(B) and to eat less and less (B) in order to avoid the dinner table. 
Betty shortly came to the attention of the school psychologist 
who recommended that Betty get counseling. The intake 
diagnosis was “adjustment reaction of childhood with incipient 
anorexia and depression.”

At 18, Betty graduated from high school and started attending 
the local junior college.  When she failed all her classes the first 
semester (B), her parents took her to a therapist who diagnosed 
Betty as a borderline character with depressive features (C).  

It is not critical that you follow all of the above portrait, it is 
only important that you recognize and keep in mind that your 
behavior — what you observe about yourself — grows out of 
your personality — the way you describe yourself and/or the way 
others describe you — and that both grow out of the character.

Because character is the deepest layer of the person and 
because no one can describe his or her own character, character 
changes slowly. Even though Reichian therapy works directly on 
the character, it does it — and must do it — slowly. You are not 
going to do the work for a month or even a year and see instant 
results. It is slow and careful work designed for the serious 
student of self-development.

Also, as you change you will probably not be aware of it. 
When I say that character is the basic way you are in the world; 
that is what I mean. When your basic nature changes, you will 
generally not be aware of the change because it is simply the 
‘you’ that is different. People around you will be aware of the 
change. And you will often see the change when you do 
something and then afterwards realize that you didn’t do it that 
way before. This is the secret magic of this work.



12 Reichian technique, Part One     
Perhaps you are the type of person who has trouble standing 

up for yourself. Then one day you effortlessly refuse to do 
something that you really did not want to do. Afterwards, it 
occurs to you that ‘gee, that was weird, that was so natural to say 
no and yet I would never have been able to do that before.’ This 
is the essence of how things work.

The power of this Reichian work is that it will change you as a 
person. Your very being will be different. Don’t concern yourself 
with emotions during the body work. If they arise, that is fine. If 
they do not arise, that is also fine. The beauty of the Reichian 
work is that done properly it will do its job, not because of you 
but despite you. This is something to keep upper most in your 
mind: do the Reichian work and give yourself permission to 
change. This is not the world of instant reward.

That brings up our next point. The great majority of the effects 
of the work occur in your dreams.

There is an easy analogy. Suppose you go into a gym for a 
weight strength-training workout. At the end of the workout will 
your muscles be bigger? Of course not. What you do see is that 
over time, as the weight training continues, your muscle bulk and 
strength changes. If it does not change during the workout, when 
does it change? While you sleep.

So it is with this work of self-improvement. The work itself 
can produce all sorts of body shaking, feelings of electric currents 
or tingling, feelings of lightness or heaviness, feelings of a part of 
your body being relaxed or tense, feelings of your chest being 
open or closed, strange tastes or smells, feelings of parts of your 
body being dead or ultra sensitive; all these things can and likely 
will happen and all are acceptable and correct. But like muscle 
tiredness at the end of strength training, the real growth, the real 
change will happen while you sleep. 

Irrespective of what you experience during sessions or 
memories that you recover, the real work, the process of 
change, will occur by way of your dreams. At the end of 
the book, in Chapter 23, I will discuss the cognitive work 
that should accompany your body work.



Chapter 1, Introduction                        13

There are two other major changes that will also occur as a 
result of the work. One is that you will, if you allow it, become 
far more emotionally sensitive. I don’t mean by that that you will 
be more emotional, I mean more emotionally sensitive. Before I 
explain the difference I want to mention the second major 
change. Because this work will make you much more aware of 
your body, it will also have a profound effect on your sexual 
experience. That simply makes sense. People who are more in 
touch with their body have better sex. No mystery there. The 
mystery is in reaching that state of heightened body sensitivity.

Now I can talk about that difference between emotional and 
emotionally sensitive. To put the point easily, it is the difference 
between a big meal and a fine meal. The emotional person is like 
the person who eats big meals. He becomes emotionally fat. The 
emotionally sensitive person is like the gourmet. He may have 
only a few courses or dishes, but each dish is small so that he can 
savor the delicate flavors. Think about becoming a gourmet of 
the emotions.

There is another way to understand what will happen with this 
work. Consider a young child. He has fallen and scraped his 
knee. He is crying. Now someone comes along and says “stop 
crying!” The question is: how does one do that, how does one go 
about ‘stopping crying?’

Well, if we were to see that child crying, his eyes are crunched 
up, his chin is quivering, the sound is coming from his throat, his 
chest is heaving up and down, his belly is going in and out. He is 
using his body all the way from his eyes to his belly. Now if he 
clamps his jaw so it can not quiver, he tenses his throat to stop the 
sound, he takes a breath and holds it, he tightens his abdominal 
muscles; he has then, by choice, interfered with all the body 
motions that permit the crying. 

Over time with repeated experiences of having to stop his 
crying these tensions become a body habit. These areas are now 
tense all the time, just like an upright posture (how many parents 
keep saying: “don’t slouch, stand up straight” or “sit up 
straight”). Soon the child can no longer cry, he can only leak 
tears. That too gets stopped as the muscles around the tear ducts 



14 Reichian technique, Part One     
are tensed. Then we get the person who “has not cried in 20 
years.” 

Well the same chest that this youngster tensed in order not to 
cry is also the same chest that relates to tenderness, love, 
empathy, sadness, pride, homesickness, and a host of similar 
feelings.

THE NATURE OF EMOTION AND ITS PLACE IN 
REICHIAN THERAPY

Reich, among a number of errors, took the totally unclear 
concept of repression and turned it, undefined, into the sine qua 
non of the therapy. At the same time he changed from a focus on 
the character to a focus on the emotions. The rest of the body-
based psychotherapists (Lowen, Boadella, etc.) followed Reich 
into this labyrinth of therapy being about repressed emotions.

Despite what you may have thought, emotions are not 
automatic. We can stop emotions or we can create them. If we 
could not create emotions there would be no profession of acting. 
When we create emotions (other than as an actor) we are doing so 
in order to manipulate ourselves or others. Who of us has not 
seen a child create tears in order to get attention? 

During the course of this work you will feel many things, 
some very old and some very new. Try to allow the feelings but 
not to cause the feelings. Also try to give physical and/or verbal 
expression to whatever you do feel. Judging a feeling to be 
inappropriate or invalid only leads to denial or to self-
manipulation and works against the therapy. Just allow, do not 
cause, do not inhibit.

I want to emphasize that emotions are NOT the goal, the 
purpose or the objective of this work. If, during a session, you 
experience some emotion, that is neither a good thing nor a bad 
thing; it is not a sign of progress or a danger signal. Reichian 
therapy, practiced conscientiously at home, will do its work 
irrespective of any emotional experiences. All too many people 
wrongly assume that expressing emotions in therapy is 
appropriate and curative. It is not. Emotional experiences and/or 
expressions are  neither appropriate nor inappropriate, they are 
simple brute facts.  What cures is insight and the work, as you 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        15
proceed through it, will allow you to better observe yourself and 
understand the source of your character.

    If you have read Reich or Lowen or most of the other body-
based psychotherapy authors, you have been told that the goal of 
the therapy is “emotional expression.” 

THAT IS NOT CORRECT

   Human beings are cognitive animals. Except for some 
primitive survival-related emotions, emotions are not primary, 
they are derivative. We start with concepts and it is from 
concepts that emotions arise. Problems in living — psychological 
problems — are not emotional problems, they are cognitive 
problems. Inappropriate emotions arise from inappropriate 
concepts. 

     “The prerequisite for the experience of feeling is con-
sciousness. Feeling is the conscious  perception of an emo-
tion.3
     It is probable that most emotions are not felt on a 
conscious level, and when they are – they are felt after the 
fact: the latter comprising actions with objects in the 
outer world or just imaginative acts. Interactions in reality 
or just imagined tend to proceed the emergence of emo-
tions and sometimes they eventuate in conscious feelings.
     There has been written a lot about basic-emotions, pri-
mary emotions, secondary emotions, background emotions 
and moods... and various taxonomies have been spelled 
out. In short, human infants and animals tend to express 

3. Technically we use three different words: affect, emotion, and 
feeling. Affect is what occurs in the brain. It may or may not have 
any body expression. Emotion is what occurs when affect has a 
body effect. Feeling is the conscious recognition of an emotion or 
an affect. There can be affect with emotion; there can also be feel-
ing without emotion. That is, it is not always necessary for there to 
be a body response to affect for there to be feeling.  This latter 
condition is the norm when the spine is cut (as in quadriplegia) 
such that the person is unable to get any sensory data from the 
body. 



16 Reichian technique, Part One     
signs of fear, joy, rage, and sorrow. There is always an 
action pattern associated with these affects: flight with fear, 
proximity with joy, fight with rage and withdrawal with 
sorrow. Besides these "basic e m o t i o n s ,  t h e r e  a r e  
e m o t i o n s  l i k e  j e a l ousy. guilt, shame. etc. The cognitive 
element is probably more complex in these later and 
maturated affects.”4

I will reiterate this view throughout this book but I don’t know 
any way to make this statement more emphatic other than to bold 
and underline it as follows:

THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS CHARACTER CHANGE; 
IT IS NOT A GOAL OF THIS WORK TO EXPRESS 
EMOTION!

   If you undertake this work with the idea that you will “get 
out your emotions,” you will fail in the work.

   Again I am leaving out all the theory of this and just giving 
you the conclusion. But I can without qualification guarantee that 
if you try to produce emotional expression from this work, you 
will get, if you are fortunate, nothing from it. If you are 
unfortunate, you will do great damage to yourself. 

   If you experience an emotion, fine, allow it to your personal 
level of comfort. But if you do not experience any emotions, that 
too is  f ine.  The work wil l  do  i ts  job.  I t  only requires 
conscientious effort on your part.

18 Reichian technique, Part One     
A FEW GENERAL POINTS

THE BASIC POSTURE

The work is done lying on your back on a bed. The bed can be 
hard or soft, it does not matter. But lying on the floor on a very 
thin mattress or a futon will not work because when you get to 
the shoulders, the chest, or the leg exercises you will be striking 
the mattress with as much force as possible and that can not be 
done against a hard floor.

Lying on your back, the knees are bent so that the feet are flat 
on the bed and about 6 to 8 inches from your behind. (Figure 1 on 
page 19) The feet should be apart by about six or seven inches 
such that they are in line with your hip joints. Similarly, the legs 
at the knees should be about six or seven inches apart (Figure 2 
on page 19). 

The arms are at your side, lying on the mattress, with the palm 
of your hands flat on the mattress. The elbows are slightly bent 
(Figure 2). 

Now with your palms flat, your wrist should also be flat 
against the bed. Many people have too much tension in their 
shoulders to allow their wrist to lie flat. Don’t try to force it. As 
the work proceeds and you reduce the tension in your chest and 
shoulders, your wrist will come down over time to rest flat on the 
mattress. 

Figure 3 on page 19 shows a minor but common error. In the 
left photograph the legs are properly spread (in line with the hip). 
In the right photograph, the legs have been allowed to lean 
outward.

Breathing fully and properly is the central issue of the 
training. I discuss the issue of breathing fully in Part One of this 
book.

EYES OPEN AT ALL TIMES

At all times, unless a given exercises says otherwise, the eyes 
should be open. Some exercises in Part Two specifically call for 
the eyes to be closed (for example, the tonic eyes closed exercise 
on page 185). Reich termed this demand for the eyes to be open 
as “staying in contact.” He was correct. It is all too easy to drop 
context and leave the body focus of the work when you allow 
your eyes to close.

DON’T OVERTAX

I want to emphasize that you should not overtax yourself in 
these exercises. Far better to do too little, then to do too much. 
This is not a race, it is not a performance, it is not a competition. 
In each session, do no more than seems to be appropriate to your 
body and to your reactions. Whatever you leave undone, will still 
be there the next time and ready for the work. Here is the rule: 
ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY

FREQUENCY

Leave at least 48 hours between sessions. If you do a session 
on Monday, do not do another one before Thursday. Give your 
dreams time to work on the material. 

On the other hand, doing the exercises only once every several 
weeks is too long. One time per week should be your minimum 
frequency

DURATION

When you are doing the exercises, continue each exercise 
until your performance drops off dramatically (that is, you are 
physically tired or you simply can no longer do the exercise 
properly) or until you are getting so strong a response that you 
think it best to stop for this session. 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        21
As before, there is no harm in stopping early; but you also do 

not want to use a decrease in performance as a ready excuse to 
not proceed. Simple common sense is your best guide.

The maximum duration of work for any one session is one 
hour.

POST EXERCISE SENSING AND FEELING

After each work session lie flat on the bed and sense your 
body. Don’t stretch or move. Just extend your legs and lay 
quietly sensing your body. It works much better if you report the 
sensations out loud (talk to the ceiling). I could give you a list of 
all the possible reports, but that would be leading and I want you 
to have your own experience, not a copy of others’ experiences. 
Take as long as you need to fully report. The sensations might 
weaken, they might strengthen, they might change in location or 
feel. Just report what you experience. Take as long as there is 
anything more that you can report. Keep in mind that there is a 
tendency to fall asleep. Don’t worry if you do fall asleep; it only 
means that you have achieved significant relaxation. 

It is crucial that the report be verbal. If you allow yourself to 
only think the report then almost immediately you will start to 
fantasize or you leave the sensations from your body and start 
thinking of something else. The only way to force yourself to stay 
with a report of your body sensations is to audibly speak the 
report.

ORDER OF THE EXERCISES

Start with the daily work and with the breathing. You can 
either mostly complete Part One of this book before you go to 
Part Two or when you have the breathing down fairly well (you 

Every sessions, even if it is a short one, should be 
followed by a sense and feel session. Extend your 
legs, don’t move, just report out loud on any body 
sensations. This is an important part of the work.



22 Reichian technique, Part One     
will see in  this book that there is a lot to do – but the main thing 
is the belly-chest order and the sound), then you can go to Part 
Two in the book and work on the body. My recommendation, 
repeated several times, is that you get a good start on the 
breathing; then, while still working on the breathing in Part One 
of the book, start on the forehead and eyes exercises in Chapter 
11. 

Here is a shocker: everyone is different. You will move at 
your own pace. There is no harm in progressing quickly to the 
work in Part Two, but don't use that as a trick to short change the 
work to be done in Part One. In any event, do not do the work in 
Chapters 12 through 22, the work on the body, before you have 
fully worked on the forehead and eyes in Chapter 11.

DON’T PUNISH YOURSELF

What is the most important word to parents? It is “discipline.” 
What is the most important word to teachers? It is “behave.” 
What is the most important word to statists? It is “obey.” 

In our life we are pushed to control, submit, inhibit. Now you 
are going to try to get rid of a lot of that obey burden. But you 
bring with you to the work the attitude of submission, of doing 
things properly. That “do it right attitude” is going to cause you 
no end of trouble with this work. You are going to have to fight 
that attitude throughout this work.

Reichian work is different from any verbal therapy you are in 
or have been in. The goal here — and this is really important — 
is that you allow rather than cause. This point needs emphasis.

If there is one error that people make more than any other in 
doing this type of work, that is body-oriented psychotherapy, it is 
that they try to “get something.” They try to “make something 
happen.” If you take that attitude I guarantee you that you will 
fail in this work. You will not get the desirable changes; you will 
not get insight; your character errors will not change, they will 
become more set and fixed. Don’t seek after any particular 
experience, don’t seek after any particular change; just do the 
work and allow to happen whatever happens. 

Now, you might take that to mean license to allow destructive 
traits to emerge. So let me make it quite clear: the job of 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        23
living is living. A change that gets in the way of living is not a 
good change. If you notice that happening, if you notice at all that 
you are starting to act out in self-damaging ways, then 
consciously step in and stop it. To allow change to occur is not 
license to be self-destructive.

When discussing the various exercises, I often mention errors 
that people make in the exercises. Don’t condemn yourself for 
not doing things perfectly. That fact that I mention the errors that 
I frequently see when I am working with patients is testimony 
that the respective error is seen often. That, in turn, means that it 
is a reasonable assumption that you, too, will make a lot of these 
errors. OK. Accept that. All too often students condemn 
themselves for not doing a given thing properly. That 
condemnation is not part of self-improvement, it is part of stuck- 
in-the-obey-attitude.

Can you name anything in life that you did perfectly from the 
start? If you can, you are a messiah. You are going to make 
errors, you are going to find things you can not do. Accept that 
fact. As you attempt each exercise, realize ahead of time that you 
are going to have to learn to do the exercise and you will not do it 
properly at the start. Yes there are some exercises that are easier 
to do than others but if you demand of yourself that you be able 
to do any given exercise only in the absolutely correct way then 
you are going to fail at this work. 

Instead of demanding perfection of yourself and condemning 
yourself when you can’t meet that standard, treat each exercise as 
a learning experience. The idea is to observe your errors with 
acceptance, not with condemnation.

Keep in mind that you are correcting a lifetime of character 
errors and that demands on your self and self-condemnation are 
exactly the opposite of correction. A principle and attitude to 

THE JOB OF LIVING IS LIVING. It is not the 
job of living to do therapy. This type of work 
should only be done to the extent that it aids you 
in the job of living. There is no reason, no 
excuse, to use therapy for self-destructive ends 



24 Reichian technique, Part One     
maintain throughout this work is: I am a student, I am learning, I 
will not be tested, I will not be graded, the more I learn over time 
the better I will be at my studies but overall I will accept my 
limitations at any given point in the work. 

DON’T STRESS BEYOND ENDURANCE

In this book I have included only a sub-set of all the exercises 
in Reichian therapy. The material I present here can be done 
alone or with a helper. 

In doing these exercise the principle is:  ALWAYS TOO 
SLOWLY!

If you go slowly, the worst that can happen is that your 
progress is less rapid than it might have been. If you go too fast 
you might accidentally go beyond your endurance.

HERE ARE THE RULES FOR THE INITIATE

WHEN I  SAY AN EXERCISE IS  POWERFUL,  
BELIEVE ME. 

Some exercises seem very easy. Some exercises sound so 
simple that it is hard to understand how they might even do 
anything. But the author has 35 years of experience with these 
exercises and their effects. When I say an exercise is powerful I 
mean it. Trust me.

DON’T DO ANY EXERCISE FOR AN EXTENDED 
PERIOD OF TIME

15 minutes is the maximum time for any exercise. Twice a 
week is the maximum frequency (except for the daily exercises 
presented later). To repeat, wait at least two days between 
workouts. That is, if you do it on Monday, do not do it again 
before Thursday. One time per week is fine, twice per week may 
be OK, more than two times per week is too much.

Pay attention to your behavior, emotions and dreams. As you 
do this work your behavior will change organically and naturally. 
It is not like therapy where you are working on a particular 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        25
problem or behavior. It is a character change, a general change in 
you as a being. 

During the process, particular behaviors can get out of hand. 
By that I mean that the behavior can become counter-productive 
to your life. An easy example is anger. If sex was the great taboo 
100 years ago, now the great taboo is anger. But anger is the 
creative emotion. It is only because you do not like some 
condition, it is only because some condition angers you, that you 
are moved to change it. Anger is good – when used for 
production. Anger is bad – when used for destruction. 

You may be too weak or too strong on the anger side. The 
Reichian work will free your anger as it will free everything else. 
But if the anger is getting out of hand it can wreck marriages, 
friendships, or jobs. Then it is too strong (it is destructive) and so 
you need to stop the exercises, perhaps even the daily ones, until 
things quiet down, until you get your angry behavior under 
control. Even if that takes a year, it is all right. However long it 
takes to get counter-productive behaviors under control, is the 
right amount of time.

If you find that emotion of any type is getting too strong, stop 
the exercises entirely until your emotions settle down. I MEAN 
IT. 

These exercises can increase any of the over 550 emotions 
listed in the English language5. When I speak of emotion most 
people think only of things like anxiety, anger, and depression. I 
MEAN ANY.

You can become too elated, too needy, too suspicious. Any 
emotion or set of emotions can start to get out of hand. Watch 
your emotional tone and do not let it or them get out of hand. 

These exercises work mainly through the dreams. Some bad 
dreams are OK. They are not unexpected. But if you find your 
sleep is severely disturbed or your dreams too frequently 
disturbing, stop the exercises for at least one week more than the 
time it takes for the sleep and/or the dreams to return to normal.

chik & H. Hellerman. (Eds.). Theories of emotion (pp. 305-339) 
New York: Academic Press.



26 Reichian technique, Part One     
On any given learning session, if your emotions become too 

strong stop the session at that point.
DON’T PUSH! ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY. Stopping when 

your emotions get too strong will not cause any damage but 
continuing on can cause damage. The issue will still be present 
and it will arise again or be fixed by the dreams.  

YOUR DAILY EXERCISES ADD TO YOUR WEEKLY 
SESSION

The daily exercises are not meaningless. If they were, I would 
not give them to you as a daily routine. The daily exercises are 
doing a lot all by themselves. When you add more exercises to 
your daily exercises you are doing that much more. If you find 
that it is necessary to stop the weekly exercise session, it might 
also be prudent to stop the daily exercises until things inside you 
quiet down. 

An exercise that may seem to do nothing at one point in your 
work may be too strong at another point in your work.

For this warning, I think an actual example will help. There is 
an exercise called “the passive session.” The exercise could not 
appear simpler. For some people this seemingly simple exercise 
is too strong even the first time. Many people have so much 
control that they do not let the sensing of the body get beyond a 
low level. In such a case, and if you are one of those controlled 
people, it might appear that the exercise had no effect. That is not 
true, but it will seem that way. But then, later after lots of time 
has been spent in the Reichian exercises, this same exercise can 
be so powerful that it leaves you shaken for weeks.

Even when I give you a time for the exercise (the passive 
session is usually done for one full hour) if you find it is having 
too strong an effect, stop early. Times given are a maximum not a 
requirement. DON’T EXCEED MAXIMUM TIMES EVEN 
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN. 

Character change is not a race. Sorry, but there are no medals 
for outstanding performance in changing character problems. 
There are, however, penalties for trying to move too fast. 

I have already said that two sessions per week is the 
maximum. I have also said that if things start to get too strong or 



Chapter 1, Introduction                        27
too rapid then you should stop the exercises until things quiet 
down. There is another way to consider this.

Your body and brain are like the thermostat in your home or 
office. As the thermostat keeps the temperature constant, so your 
body and brain keep their way-of-being constant. Your 
subconscious fights desperately not to change. That is the way we 
are built. Whether by God or by evolution, that is what we are. 
We fight change just because we are what we are. 

Now with the Reichian exercises, you are going to try to 
change that. But your being resists the change. Please don’t 
pretend to yourself that you are more enlightened or a more 
evolved person. You are still human and you are still subject to 
the nature of the human being. Remember this work is 
psychotherapy. You have spent your life up till now developing 
the character you have; changing it will not happen quickly and it 
should not happen quickly. 

This is not a race. This is not to see how much you can do in a 
short time compared to your fantasy of the ideal or the speed of 
your friend. Each and every one of us has our own personal 
devils. Some devils are on the surface, they are obvious. But the 
important devils are well hidden. When you find a hidden devil, 
back up. Give it time. Don’t push yourself. 

No system is right for everyone. The best single guide you 
have for doing these exercises and proceeding from one area to 
another is your own reaction. It is OK if you seem to have no 
reaction, just keep with it. Different people respond at different 
speeds. 

But if you seem to be going in the wrong direction (that is, it is 
making your life less productive rather than more productive) 
then probably these exercises are not the right ones for you. 
There are other ways to self-improvement. Your obligation to 
yourself and to your life is to find the best path for you. 

PHYSICAL EXERCISE

You may do whatever your normal exercise is at the same 
time you are doing the Reichian work, with one exception. If you 
are doing weight lifting, that is few slow repetitions against a 
heavy weight, then you are building tension into your body that 



28 Reichian technique, Part One     
will fight this work. If you do many fast repetitions against a 
comparatively small weight, that is no problem for this work. 

Few slow repetitions against heavy weights builds bulk and 
tension into your muscles. That is, to use the medical terms, it 
builds tension rather than tonus. Many fast repetitions against 
lighter weights build tonus (what is usually called: definition) 
into your muscles without building chronic tension.

ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY

I can not emphasize this too strongly. Some of the exercises 
seem almost too simple, and yet they can be very powerful even 
though seemingly simple. If you find that you are moving very 
slowly, don't be troubled. That is fine. But if you find that you are 
becoming too upset or that the changes are happening too 
quickly, then stop the work for a while. Allow your subconscious 
time to adjust to the change. 

The subconscious resides in the more primitive parts of the 
brain and has more contact with the body than does the conscious 
mind. In effect, it is the subconscious mind that maintains the 
rigidity of the body. If your work is too threatening to that mind/
body system, your subconscious has all the resources to produce 
many physical and behavioral and emotional effects which stand 
in the way of living well. That is not the idea of the work.

It is simply not possible for me to emphasize too strongly that 
you should respect the power of your own subconscious and 
proceed slowly with the work. 

MEDICAL ISSUES IN THE THERAPY

At the appropriate points in the book I will repeat parts to this 
section. You don’t have to attempt to memorize these issues here. 
I inserted these medical issues here, right at the start, because, 
after all, this is a book on body-based psychotherapy and that 
inherently means there are medical implications.

HYPERVENTILATION



Chapter 1, Introduction                        29
Reichian therapy utilizes deep breathing. The deep breathing 

results in a condition called hyperventilation. I will discuss 
hyperventilation in Chapter three. Hyperventilation is not without 
some medical implications.6

If you have or might have epilepsy, deep breathing can bring 
on seizures so it is best for you to skip this type of self- 
improvement work7. There are also reports in the medical 
literature of hyperventilation causing heart attacks. This is very 
rare, but I would be remiss to not even mention it. You can read 
about this at: http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/gw/Cmd, use the search 
terms of:   hyperventilation myocardial infarction.

PUSH BREATHING

Push breathing is an exercise I will introduce in Chapter five. 
You can always skip this exercise, but if you use it there is a 
medical issue to be considered.

This exercise raises the pressure inside the brain cavity (the 
inter-cranial pressure). This can result in death for someone who 
has a silent aneurism8 in his brain. If you have had an 
amphetamine habit, don’t do this exercise. Also there is a genetic 
condition called a “berry aneurism.” It is rare, but it is also silent 
until it ruptures. There is a medical way to test for the presence of 
a brain aneurism, but you are very unlikely to get any physician 
to prescribe it absent any present medical indication of its need.

There is also a medical issue in this exercise if you have 
elevated blood pressure. Many pharmacies have a free blood 
pressure test stand that you can use or you can purchase an 
automated blood pressure device at the pharmacy. If you have a 
doctor, then your blood pressure is in your medical records and 
you can call your doctor’s office to get the values.

If you are on medication that is reducing your blood pressure 
to a normal value, then this exercise should be OK. If you are in 

6. For my European readers, what is called hyperventilation in the 
States is called DeCosta’s syndrome in Europe.

7. I have had one patient who, while I was working on her neck, had 
a short petit mal seizure. So it is a real problem.

8. An aneurism is a weakening in the wall of a blood vessel.



30 Reichian technique, Part One     
doubt, ask your treating physician. Because he might easily 
misunderstand what you are doing, this exercise IS NOT the 
same as a valsalva maneuver.

THE JAW IN EXERCISE

This exercise is discussed in Chapter 13. Any exercise with 
the jaw has a medical implication because of the fragility of the 
jaw joint.

The jaw joint that allows the mouth to open and move side to 
side for chewing is a very small and therefore fragile joint. You 
should either abort or not do at all any exercise that produces any 
pain or even discomfort in your jaw joint. The joint is located 
about 1/2 inch forward from your ear. If you place your hand on 
the side of your face and then open and close your mouth you 
will be able to feel where this joint is located. This exercise will 
produce pulling in the muscles of the jaw, but that is not the same 
as strain on the jaw joint. 

I repeat, if you have even a suspicion that you are stressing the 
jaw joint by any of the jaw exercises, then don’t do that exercise 
or perhaps even any of the exercises in Chapter 13 on the jaw. Let 
me put it this way: if you injure that joint you can have pain with 
every single bite of food. No Reichian work is worth that 
consequence.

RETURNING TO A CLEARED AREA

I’ll mention this issue once more in Part Two just to remind 
you of it. It is a curious thing about “armor” that when it has been 
eliminated, it has a tendency to recur. That is, as an example, you 
might entirely clear up your forehead and eyes only to find that 
six months later they are no longer cleared up. They have 
“rearmored.” What this means in practice, in doing this work, is 
that you will need to periodically return to previously fixed areas 
of the body to see that they have not retensed. 

HOW TO USE THE AUDIO



Chapter 1, Introduction                        31
The audio that accompanies this book, entitled The Sounds of 

Reichian, will aid you in producing each of the sounds that are 
used in Reichian. The audio lists examples of wrong sounds and 
the desired correct sound. As with almost everything else in this 
book, the desired sound is a goal, not a standard. Do your best at 
any given time in the work and accept that as your then present 
level of ability. Perfection is a nice idea for gods, it is a foolish 
idea for humans.

The audio is constructed from four patients in the therapy plus 
the sounds of the author. While a major goal of The Sounds of 
Reichian is to let you hear the normal ‘ah’ sound, it also provides 
one or more examples of all the other sounds used in the therapy 
process. As an example you will hear the ‘ah’ sound from the 
shake the shoulders loose exercise from Chapter 16 done both 
properly and improperly. 

ON MIXING THIS WORK WITH OTHER BODY 
WORK

I already mentioned physical exercise and problems possibly 
associated with that work. As for Yoga, I had a patient some 
years ago who had trained in Yoga in India and now taught it 
here. For all this person’s competence in Yoga, his or her (to not 
give out any clues as to gender) body did not show the least effect 
of the Yoga on any Reichian “armor.” Thus doing Yoga at the 
same time as this work will neither aid nor hinder the work.

                   IMPORTANT

THE EYES SHOULD BE OPEN AT 
ALL TIMES IN ALL EXERCISES 
UNLESS THE EXERCISE 
DESCRIPTION SAYS OTHERWISE.



32 Reichian technique, Part One     
This also applies to Pilattes. I had a Pilattes teacher as a 

patient, and, moreover, one who was formally trained. For all the 
training and the daily doing as he or she taught the method to 
others, again it made no difference in the Reichian “armor.” So 
Pilattes like Yoga neither helps nor harms this work.

I have no personal experience with the various martial arts like 
Judo or Karati or Tai Chi or the like. Thus I am not able to 
authoritatively say whether any of this type of training and 
practice will or will not have any impact -- beneficial or harmful -
- to the therapy.

As to meditation9, the medical literature indicates that it is 
medically beneficial. It is especially useful in overcoming 
phobias by focusing on the phobic situation until the anxiety is 
moderate and then moving to  a peaceful  and relaxing 
visualization or thought. The process of approaching the phobia 
and then leaving it is repeated on successive sessions until the 
prior phobia has lost its impact. 

In context of the Reichian therapy, it is a benign procedure 
(neither helpful nor harmful) provided the focus is not on the 
body and body sensations. If the focus is on the body, you are in 
effect doing a passive session (CHAPTER 21, page 304) and if 
you have not progressed to that level, this is too powerful an

CHAPTER 2

STARTING THE WORK – DAILY 
EXERCISES

EXERCISES TO DO EACH DAY

The time just after arising from sleep is immensely valuable 
time for self-improvement. Just a few minutes are needed, but 
doing these exercises on a daily basis will yield a lot. They will 
improve the way you feel for the day and over time will yield 
major benefits. There is no loss if you miss days, even weeks, 
between doing the exercises. However, like time spent in 
physical exercise at a gym, the more regular you are the more 
benefit you will get. The exercises take under 15 minutes so there 
is little reason not to do them. Even when there are young 
children present, if you have time to shower in the morning then 
you have the time for these exercises.

Don’t expect that you will do these exercises well when you 
start doing them. Like everything else in life, they require 
practice. Just doing them, whether well or at the beginner level, 
will yield benefit. And you will get better at the work over time. 

However, even before introducing you to the most basic of the 
Reichian work, there is an issue that is of such supreme 
importance that I have put it here prior to even the starting the 
discussion. It is an issue which is never mentioned in discussions 
of therapy, whether verbal psychotherapy or body-based 
psychotherapy. That issue is: courage.



34 Reichian technique, Part One     

A NOTE ON COURAGE

Later I write about the big issue of control and how it is an 
enemy standing in the way of change. Here I want to emphasize 
— really as strongly as the written word can do — that there is an 
issue that is critical but that you have probably never heard any 
therapist talk about.

That issue is: courage! Frankly, there is almost no issue 
standing in the way of change which is more important than 
courage. Change is scary. It is unsettling. 

In verbal therapy the patient or client is in control of what is 
happening. Even when dealing with something like a phobia, you 
are in charge of how much you do in overcoming the issue. But 
in body-based therapy, the change just happens. You have 
memories and emotions emerging and your character is 
changing, all without you planning it or working directly on it. 

All of us have things buried in our character. If we did not 
have things buried we would not have a character (which is to 
say, we would be dead). But since these things are buried, we 
have no idea that they are there. Now behaviors, attitudes, 
memories, moods and feeling emerge seemingly from nowhere; 
that is scary. 

All I can say is that if things are too strong, take a break from 
the work. As always remember the rule: ALWAYS TOO 
SLOWLY. But be careful. Don’t let a break be the reason why 
you never seem to return to the work. Courage is the big issue.

You have to have the guts, the willingness, to let things 
emerge uncontrolled and unaccounted for and simply accept that 
what is emerging is just a part of you that you did not know 
about. 

Now don’t take that as license to be self-destructive. If the 
emerging character traits (as manifest in behavior) are getting in 
the way of living, then step in and deliberately control the 
behaviors. The job of living is living. Self-improvement — by 
any means — is good only as long as it aids the job of living. 
Courage is good, stupidity is bad.

The issue of courage is something I address in the first session 
with every patient who comes to see me. In my years as a 



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     35
practicing psychotherapist, there is no single issue which has 
resulted in more patients dropping out than the issue of courage.

As the therapy progresses, whether verbal or Reichian or the 
normal combination of the two, changes start to happen. The 
changes are not, usually, under the volitional control of the 
patient. They just find that they are doing what to them are 
strange things. Then the fear of change arises. There is even a 
psychological term for it. It is called “phrenophobia,” the fear of 
going insane. It is not that the new behaviors and sense of the self 
are bizarre, it is only that the person does not know where they 
are coming from and where they might end. 

Suddenly the person does not know “who am I?” “What’s 
happening to me?” “I’m not sure I like this change.” In other 
words, they are not controlling the change and that is where 
courage comes in.

Courage is the determination to push through change, to let 
happen what is happening and to accept; after all, that is the basic 
purpose of a good therapy process. 

Not surprisingly, Shakespeare said it best: “But screw your 
courage to the sticking-place And we’ll not fail” (Macbeth, act 1 
sc 7)

DAILY EXERCISES

THE EYES

This exercise needs a mirror. Either a hand mirror, a shaving 
mirror or a full length mirror will do. It is best if you do not have 
to hold the mirror.

EYES
FACE
SHOULDERS
DIAPHRAGM

Step 1
looking at your face as though it were someone else

Question 1: what attitudes are in the face
Question 2: what feelings are in the face
Question 3: put attitudes and feelings together

Way 1: script or scene
looking at your face as your own

Way 2: when did these attitudes or emotions
start; why am I responding this way to life

Step 2
looking only at the eyes and creating emotion



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     37

Figure 4

THE EYES, STEP 1

Simply look at your own face. Don’t be so near to the mirror 
that you can see only part of your face at one time. Be far enough 
away that you can see your whole face as you would look at 
someone else. The idea here, at this point in the exercise, is that it 
is NOT your face in the mirror, it is someone else’s face. You do 
not know this person in the mirror, you are seeing him (her) for 
the first time, perhaps at another table at a restaurant.

Of course this is not that easy to do. We are so accustomed to 
looking at our own face that it is difficult to separate our own 
view of ourself from that face in the mirror. But there is also 
another difficulty.

Sometimes we look at our reflection in a mirror as just our 
face, but other times we look at that face from the viewpoint of 
someone else seeing it. We take care to prepare our hair (and our 
makeup) so that it might create a particular impression in the 
mind of someone else looking at that face. This fact, this point of 
view of the face, makes this exercise even more difficult. 

What you are trying to accomplish initially in this daily 
exercise is to separate your self completely from the face in the 
mirror; you are seeing a stranger (not you) and you are reading 
that stranger’s face.

QUESTION 1



38 Reichian technique, Part One     
What attitude do you see displayed by that face? Suppose you 

saw that face at a party, what impression would you have of that 
person even before you met or spoke to him or her? This is 
important. It is not your face; it is a stranger’s face. Don’t judge 
parts of the face like the lips are too thin, the nose too big, the 
bags under the eyes make the person look tired.

Use a descriptive word that has some real content. For 
example: “that looks like a nice person” will not do. “Nice” is 
way too broad a word. Try to come down to something more 
specific. Try to come up with a word or phrase that really says 
something about that stranger’s face. Is the person childish or 
mature? Is the person open or secretive? Is the person 
approachable or standoffish? Is the person relaxed or wound up? 
Is the person alert to the moment or pre-occupied? Is the person 
confident or unsure of himself (herself)? These are just examples 
of the type of question you want to ask. There are many many 
other possibilities.

For each of the two models below (Figure 5 on page 40), take 
a piece of paper for each and answer the following questions. 
You will have no way of knowing whether you are right or wrong 
so that is not the issue. The idea is to reach into your own 
subconscious and see what answers you get. 

     Question 
1 is this person happy or unhappy with his life
2 is this a good day or a bad day
3 is the person looking forward to the day or 

wishing  it were over

TRY EACH DAY TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT THE FACE OF THE DAY. TRY 
NOT TO JUST USE THE SAME WORDS DAY 
AFTER DAY. THIS IS SELF-EXPLORATION 
AND THEREFORE USING THE SAME 
WORDS DAY AFTER DAY IS NOT TO  
EXPLORE; IT IS TO EVADE.



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     39
4 is this person married or unmarried
5 does he have any children
6 does he have a hobby and if so, what is it 
7 does he take vacations, if so where does he like

to go or what does he like to do
8 is he outgoing or shy
9 does he have few friends, a few close friends, or a 

lot of friends
10 if he has a job, what is it
11 is he a book reader and if so what types of books
12 what is his level of education
13 what are his likes and dislikes
14 now you add to this list as many other things as

you can find in that face — a few examples: 
is this person interested in current events
is he political and if so, where do his politics
     lie
what current movie would he like
what current TV shows does he like

Don't let the above questions throw you off. This is an 
exercise for the book (and one you can practice all day long with 
people sitting in a restaurant or walking down the street or in a 
supermarket). Your main work is to do this each day on yourself 
to see what your face is saying to both yourself and to others each 
day.

DON’T JUDGE. Whatever the face communicates is simple 
fact. Whether you approve or disapprove of something does not 
change reality. Don’t substitute judgment for the straightforward 
recognition of isness.

QUESTION 2

Now put a feeling word or feeling phrase or several feeling 
words or phrases on the face in the mirror. What feeling(s) is 
(are) showing in that face?

Be careful not to judge, be careful not to let yourself deny a 
feeling because you don’t approve of it. If the feeling is sadness 
and you don’t think you should be sad, you have nothing to be 



40 Reichian technique, Part One     
sad about, don’t skip that “sadness” evaluation just because you 
don’t approve of it.

Figure 5                                                     

The same is true of the opposite. If you think you should be 
happy or pleased, don’t read that emotion into the face because 
you think it should be there. Just be honest. It is, after all, a 
stranger’s face and whatever emotion is there, it is there. It is 
simply a fact.

Try not to stop at one emotion and especially try not to get 
stuck with a single word day after day. As many people know, 
each day when we awaken we have a feeling tone for the day as a 
result of current experiences and/or as a result of our dreams. We 
seldom have a single feeling present at any given time. As you go 
more deeply into this book and as you practice you will find that 
it is rare at any given moment for there to be only one feeling. 
Even when, for example, pride is the main feeling for doing a 
task well; you will find that there are perhaps a half dozen other 
feelings that ride quietly along with the pride. 

Further, don’t try to match the emotion word(s) to the attitude 
word(s) from question 1. A person who seems open and friendly 
can also be angry. A person who enjoys life can also be 
depressed. 



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     41
Treat the attitude question and the emotion question as two 

completely separate questions. Remember you are going to be 
doing this exercise each and every day so the more you can say 
each time the more you are growing in self-awareness; what you 
can see in your face and what others may be seeing in your face.

QUESTION 3 (advanced)

Now we take the question 1 attitude(s) answer and the 
question 2 emotion(s) answer and we put them together. This is a 
more advanced technique and it takes longer to do properly than 
the first two questions. This is because if you are good at this 
exercise than you have more than one attitude and more than one 
emotion that you read in that stranger’s face. The subtlety of this 
question is learning how to make combinations of the attitude 
and the emotions you see in that stranger’s face.

Here is an example. Suppose you see the attitudes of boredom 
and stand offishness and you see the emotions of sadness and 
self-pity. So we have:

1. boredom and sadness
2. boredom and self-pity
3. stand offishness and sadness
4. stand offishness and self-pity

Now boredom and sadness don’t seem to go naturally 
together. Why would someone be sad about being bored? But 
reverse those two and you get something interesting; instead of 
boredom and sadness it is sadness and boredom. Now that is a 
natural combination. If someone is sad most of the time it is easy 
to understand why he can be bored with that and life in general.

How about boredom and self-pity? Here either way will work. 
That is one can be bored with their own constant self-pity. Or, 
reversing, one can pity himself because he is bored (with life). 

But then with stand offishness and sadness, these do go 
together. Because someone is always rejecting others — the 
standoffish attitude — he can be sad at the loneliness of his 
situation. The same is true for stand offishness and self-pity.

Now we can try putting that all together. If someone is 
standoffish, he is alone, that loneliness leads to sadness, and then 



42 Reichian technique, Part One     
he can be bored with the sadness. (Besides, appearing bored 
further leads to being alone since that is not an inviting attitude, it 
does not tend to attract others.) 

So that is the type of investigation that you can do.

way 1

You continue to treat the attitude(s) and feeling(s) as 
belonging to a stranger. Then you try to create a scene — much 
like writing a script or seeing a stage play or a movie — where all 
those attitudes and feelings occur together. 

Some people tend to think in pictures and other people tend to 
think in words. Either way you can create a scene (picture 
thinking) or a script (word thinking) of the attitudes and feelings. 

Depending on your ability and your time, you can treat way 2 
as an alternate or an addition to way 1. That is, you can do only 
way 2 or only way 1 or both. 

way 2
 
Here you take back your reading of attitude(s) and feeling(s) 

and put them on yourself. Now you want to ask either (1) when in 
my life when I was young did I have this set of attitudes and 
feelings together or (2) why am I responding to events in my life 
with this set of attitudes and feelings? 

Way 2 can be harder or easier than way 1. It depends on the 
circumstances and your individual makeup. As you practice more 
and more of the exercises in this book you will get better at both 
ways and thus get more out of this daily exercise.

Note, again, that all this should be done without judgment. 
You are exploring; you are coming to understand yourself. If you 
insert  judgement into the process (with approval or disapproval) 
you cut off the process and the benefits. Whatever is, is. It does 
not matter whether you approve or disapprove. It simply is. 

Any time you find yourself thinking something like: Oh, I 
don’t like that; then you have that judgement switch on and you 
need to turn it off. The only judgment you should make is the 
judgment that judgment is inappropriate.



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     43

THE EYES, STEP 2

Now come closer to the mirror because you want to focus 
your whole attention on just your eyes.

WITH JUST YOUR EYES – IGNORE ALL THE REST OF 
YOUR FACE 

Try to express, one by one, each of the following feelings or 
attitudes: anger, fear, happiness, sadness, disgust, longing, 
contentment, empathy, disinterest, love, and hate (you can add to 
this list). Note that the actual change in the eyes is very tiny and it 
does not matter whether you can make out any change. The goal 
of this exercise is to make the eyes alive.

You might know the often quoted phrase: the eyes are the 
window to the soul. They are. You can see in someone’s eyes 
whether he is interested, uninterested, bored, pre-occupied, 
happy, fearful, angry and so much more. In general eyes can be 
alive or dead. People with expressive eyes are more attractive, 
more interesting. People with dead eyes tend to put us off, they 
appear as though the person were sleeping their way though life. 
Consciously or subconsciously we respond to the look in 
someone’s eyes. 

The goal of this daily exercise is to make your eyes alive.
To do this exercise properly you have to create the feeling in 

yourself and express it in your eyes. This is the kind of exercise 
that actors do in acting workshops that allows a great actor or 
actress to say so much with a close-up shot of his or her face or 
eyes.

This is a very powerful exercise over time. Don’t be 
concerned if you can not seem to get anything at first. 

Also don’t overextend yourself (remember: don’t stress 
yourself beyond endurance). If any given feeling is too hard on 
you, let it go for now. There is no rush. Come back to it days, 
weeks, or months later. It is better to skip something than to push 
yourself to perform and in the process go too far. 

The issue here is the integrity of your effort, not the fact of 
your results. Like most things, practice makes perfect. 



44 Reichian technique, Part One     

THE FACE

From the eyes, we move to the face. While it seems simple, 
over time this exercise will pay big dividends.

The exercise is simply to contract and relax the muscles in 
your face. Note that there are, in most people, 22 muscles in the 
face. So there is a lot to move. You can wrinkle and relax the 
forehead muscle. You can squint or open widely your eyelids. 
You can wrinkle the nose (as if you are smelling a bad smell), 
you can even control the size of your nostrils (open and relax). In 
all there are 10,000 possible combinations of facial muscle 
patterns. That is not my number, it comes from Paul Ekman, the 
world's leading expert on emotion in the face.

If you get good you can raise one eyebrow and not the other. 
You can pull your eyebrows together (producing so-called frown 
lines). You can pull the inside of your eyebrows up or the outside 
of your eyebrows up or raise the whole eyebrow.

Of course you can smile and frown. You can tense your lips 
(purse) and you can extend your lips (pout). You can move your 
jaw back toward the ears (retract), out (extend), or to the left or 
right. You can open your mouth widely or clench your jaw.

There is one major requirement of this exercise and it will not 
do its job if you violate this requirement. The ‘must do’ rule is 
that all the movements must go slowly from one face to another. 
If, for example, you move your jaw all the way to the left and 
then bounce to all the way to the right, you are not doing the 
exercise correctly. It will not do its job.

The proper way is to, in slow motion, add new tension and 
then relax old tension. For example, with the jaw all the way to 
the left you now add squinting the left (or even the right) eye and 
then as you slowly move the jaw back to the center you add 
arching the left (or right) eyebrow.

Move the face slowly from one state to another



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     45
This is only an example. The point is that you should try to 

make as many different faces as possible, adding new ones as you 
get good, but always moving slowly from one to the other.

THE SHOULDERS

From the face, we move to the shoulders. For the daily 
exercises this involves only four positions. In the second part of 
this book where I discuss the shoulders I give you a lot more 
shoulder exercises, but they are not for daily use.

EXERCISE 1

Standing up, pull your shoulder blades together in back as 
tightly as you can. Hold for about 20 seconds. Then relax. Think 
about it as though you are trying to touch your two shoulders 
blades together.

Figure 8

EXERCISE 2

Standing up, pull your shoulder blades together in front as 
tightly as you can. Hold for about 20 seconds. Then relax. This is 
a little harder than trying to touch your shoulder blades, but try.

1. pull shoulders together in the back
2. pull shoulders together in the front
3. shrug the shoulders
4. reach outward



48 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 9

EXERCISE 3

Standing up, shrug your shoulders and hold as tightly as 
possible. Do not let them relax. Hold for about 20 seconds. Then 
relax. This is easy to do, we all shrug our shoulders; but here you 
want to shrug them as high and as tight as you possibly can.

The bottom row of picture in figure 10 (next page) shows a 
limitation in the model’s ability to shrug. Most or all of my 
readers will have read Reich. Reich used a single term: “armor” 
to describe all muscular attitudes. The use of a single term 
without amplification was unfortunate. It leads one to think of 
“armor” as only chronic tension. In fact, “armor” takes four 
forms: (1) chronic tension, (2) chronic flacidity, (3) rubbery 
muscle tone, and (4) the inability to appropriately use a muscle or 
muscle group. The photographs on the next page show an 
inability to use the trapezius to shrug the shoulders.



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     49

Figure 10

EXERCISE 4

Now extend your arms in front at 90 degrees to your body 
(that is, your hands are at shoulder level). Reach out as though 
you were asking for someone to help you or you were signaling 
that you wanted to hug someone.

Reach as far forward as you can. Strain to extend your hands 
further from your body. Hold for about 20 seconds.

Figure 11

 Here again (as with the bottom photographs in figure 10) we 
see an example of how the body speaks about the character. Note 
that on the left the reach is also upward while on the right it is 
straight. Neither model was given any instructions except “now 
reach forward as though you wanted to reach to someone.” The 



50 Reichian technique, Part One     
model on the left is like a child reaching to be picked up while the 
model on the right is reaching to embrace someone. 

Now, here, I have to give you another caution. Don’t control 
your execution on any of these exercises. Don’t pretend that 
someone is watching and judging how well you do an 
exercise. In pointing out the difference in these pictures I am 
only saying that the character is expressed in how we use our 
bodies. It is impossible to fake a character, it is there — in you — 
no matter what you do. If you try to do an exercise in a particular 
way all you will be doing is attempting to defend your character 
from change. You will not make this work more effective, you 
will defeat it.

Returning to my theme of the daily exercises for the 
shoulders, a more advanced form of this exercise – not 
recommended for students at the beginning of the daily therapy 
process – is to add words to the reaching out part of the exercise. 
With the hands straight, some examples are: “help me,” 
“mommy,” “daddy,” “why.” These are just examples. You 
should use whatever words seem to be right at the moment, even 
if they make no sense. You can also do this exercise with the 
hands bent back,  as though you pushing something away. Then 
some words to use are: “stop,” “no,” “go away,” and “I won’t.”

THE DIAPHRAGM

GAGGING

The last of the daily exercises deals with the throat and 
diaphragm. This is done in the shower. It can be done at the sink, 
but it is best done in the shower. 

The exercise is gagging. Before you gag at the thought of 
gagging, realize that in the morning there is nothing in the 

Gagging
breath is continuous
gag by touching the back of the tongue, or the uvula

or the back of the throat
try not to make any sound with the gag



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     51
stomach. The gag will not cause any food to come up from the 
stomach since there is no food in the stomach to come up. [note: 
If you have any physical pain of any nature, then do not do it.]

This is the most difficult exercise to do properly. It is easy to 
do it improperly. This exercise involves breathing, gagging, and 
not closing the throat.

Some people have no problem with gagging, others regard it 
as so abhorrent that they can not even consider it. Courage! It 
won’t hurt you no matter what. If it were not a very very 
beneficial exercise I could have just not mentioned it and no one 
would be the wiser. But it is both beneficial and, once you learn 
to do it, will start your day with an alertness and sense of 
presence which no other thing can even approach. Believe me or 
not, you will come to enjoy it greatly; the resulting sense of 
aliveness is powerful. 

ONE: BREATHING

The breath should be continuous, inhale then exhale then 
inhale. Think of it like a pendulum. You know how when the 
pendulum reaches the end of the swing to one side it immediately 
starts the swing to the other side. Back and forth with no pauses. 
That is the way the breathing should be. The inhale causes the 
exhale which causes the inhale. I will discuss this at length later 
in Part One of this book. 

This continuous inhale and exhale is not panting. The breath 
should be as deep (using both belly and chest breathing) as you 
are able to make it and it is neither rapid nor overly slow 
(controlled). It is simply a natural deep breath at a natural speed.

TWO: GAGGING

Gagging: the gag may be produced by any one of three things. 
They are: (1) pressure on the back of the tongue, (2) tickling the 
little bit of tissue that hangs down in the back of your mouth (the 
uvula), or (3) touching the back of the throat. Some people find 
that sticking out the tongue helps in the process.

Gagging is a reflex. Just let your body do its thing. Don’t work 
to cause it like trying to make it happen and, of course, don’t try 



52 Reichian technique, Part One     
to stop it. Remember there is nothing in the stomach so you don’t 
have to be concerned with bad smells or ugly liquid coming up.

The induction of the gag reflex works with the breathing. On 
the exhale try to induce a gag, on the inhale pull your  fingers to 
the front of the mouth so there is no induction. So it is: exhale 
fingers in, inhale fingers out. This is shown below in  Figure 12. 
In the left photograph he is exhaling so his fingers are in, on the 
right photograph he is inhaling so his fingers are out.

Figure 12

Many people have a strong aversion to gagging. This comes 
from being sick as a child and feeling helpless and dependent and 
not getting the mothering you needed at the time. Throwing up 
can be strongly connected to being helpless, being dependent, 
being alone, being ill, being abandoned, even with having to take 
care of someone else when you hated the smell. 

The purpose of this work is to improve yourself and that 
means correcting the inappropriate residue of childhood. If you 
have this strong aversion to gagging from childhood, that only 
means that there is more work to do. It is not a reason to skip this 
exercise.

THREE: THE THROAT

One more point before I get to the hard part, the throat. The 
exercise should be done standing upright, not bent at the waist. It 
is fine to lean a bit forward and brace yourself with a hand 
against the wall, but don’t do it bent over.



Chapter 2, Daily exercises                     53
Now the throat. If you have the breathing part down 

(rhythmic) and you have the fingers in the mouth part worked 
out (back on the exhale, forward on the inhale), the next part is 
the throat. Here we are after one big objective: NO SOUND! 
Most people when they do a voluntary gag close their throat 
when the gag reflex occurs. They produce a strong sound such as 
“ugh”, or “gug” or the like. THIS IS WRONG! The gag should 
be allowed to proceed with an open throat. There should be no 
sound with the gag or rather the only allowed sound is a soft “uh” 
that may occur with the gag. 

Again, no food is going to come up from the stomach. This 
exercise can cause your eyes to water, cause the production of 
lots of slimly saliva (that is, not watery), cause you to want to 
blow you nose (it is a wonderful exercise for clearing the 
sinuses), cause your body to tremble. Whatever happens, trust it. 
Allow it. It is the wisdom of the body. 

Don’t overdo this exercise. Three minutes is more than 
enough or up to about five gag reflexes. Keep in mind the 
standards of the exercise (breathe, fingers, throat) and don’t push 
yourself. If you can do it right the first day, fine. If it takes you a 
year to get it and have the gag reflex with an open throat, also 
fine. Your body knows what is best. Trust it and just keep 
working to improve.

CHAPTER 3

APPROACHING THE WORK

Here, in Part One of the book, I discuss breathing. In Part Two 
of the book I will go over all the body areas and give you the 
exercises for each area. 

You have to make your own choices in life and be responsible 
for the results; but if you want my recommendations, here is the 
way I think might be most beneficial. As I said in Chapter one, 
just plain read through the whole book. Don’t expect to learn the 
material; in fact assume that some of it will be confusing. That is 
a first run through just to see the scope and the general nature of 
the work.

Then, when you have read all of it, come back to this chapter 
and read for understanding (but not memorization) this and the 
next chapter and start the breathing work.  After a few months 
just with the breathing work, when you have some degree of 
mastery of the proper breathing cycle, then start the work in 
Chapter 11 on the forehead and eyes. You now have all you 
really need for the next, let’s say, twelve months. Assuming you 
have now been at the work for 9 to 12 months, you can re-read 
Chapters 5 through to the end of the book and pick out some of 
the more advanced breathing techniques and some of the body 
exercises.

I need to say it many times for proper emphasis: every one is 
different. Better too slow than too fast. 

This material is life changing. Your motivation to use the 
material I present is an important part of the process. In time and 
with experience and practice all this material will be a part of 
you; but to start with reading everything and trying to master 
everything at once it is easy to become confused and to forget 
important parts of the exercises.



56 Reichian technique, Part One     

Why is it, do you suppose, that every type of self-training 
emphasizes proper breathing? Proper breathing is emphasized in 
yoga, in Pilates, in meditation and even in exercise workouts. In 
general I do not tell you what to expect as a result of the work 
since I do not want to activate your “should” and “should not” 
system, I don’t want you trying to achieve a particular change in 
yourself as opposed to letting it develop naturally, organically. 
But I will tell you some of the changes that freeing your 
breathing will produce.

While everyone is unique, no single claim is true for everyone, 
there is in almost all languages a number of phrases which speak 
to what is controlled in the breathing, in the chest. Here are a few 
to give you the idea: heart sick, my heart goes out to, aching in 
the chest, weight on my chest, I can’t breathe, puffed up like a 
frog, a gasp of surprise, swollen with pride, and on it goes. What 
is the common element? Everything related to love, tenderness, 
empathy, loneliness, longing and the other related feelings and 
attitudes. 

This work doesn’t make you change, it does not make you 
feel, it allows you to change and to feel. What is now warded off 
or inhibited is released. What is now prohibited is allowed. The 
change is in your very nature as a person. 

There are some implications of those changes which are not 
immediately evident. 

Number one is that your dreams and fantasies will gradually 
change. If you are someone who is able to remember dreams, you 
will find that your dream symbols will change. 

Number two is that you will find that you are more sensitive 
both to yourself and to others. You have more capacity to 
experience the emotions of the chest. Also you will have 
flexibility in life to adapt easily to change. How many of us are 
not set, not stuck, in our ways? Not many. But rigidity is not 
necessary. The flexibility that you will bring to your breathing 
with this book will translate into flexibility in life.



Chapter 3, Approaching the work              57
Number three is that your experience of sex will change 

dramatically. This change will not fully occur until you get, in 
Part Two, to the belly and pelvic exercises; but you may get a 
taste of the changes with the breathing in Part One.10

Number four is that other people will experience you 
differently. Pride – sometimes valid pride and sometimes phony 
pride – is experienced in the chest. That is why we can see pride 
in children. When they are proud of their accomplishments they 
“swell with pride.” With pride comes self-confidence and self- 
assurance. Others will see these changes before you do; but when 
you notice the changes it might be socially wise to tell others 
what you are doing so that they are not confused by the change in 
your attitude and behavior. Pride, after all, is not just related to 
the changes in your being, it is also related to your pride in the 
self-improvement work you are doing, to what you have 
accomplished by your efforts at self-change.

The bible is all over the place on pride, but here is what I 
mean:

“Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but 
on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house” 
(Mat. 5,15).

SENSE AND FEEL

Just because it is so important to the work I repeat here that 
after each work session you should do a sense-and-feel report 
session. Even though you just read it, go back now to POST 
EXERCISE SENSING AND FEELING on page 21 and re-read 
it.

BREATHING FOR ALL REICHIAN WORK

10.You will not get the change in sexual pleasure until you make it a 
habit to breath deeply and quickly during sexual activity.

Deep breathing does not increase oxygen, it reduces
carbon dixoide

Hyperventilation
Yawning is special and takes precedence



58 Reichian technique, Part One     

Proper deep breathing is at the heart of the process.
First, I want to correct one frequent misconception. It is 

almost universally believed that deep breathing will increase the 
oxygen in your body. That is not correct.

Your blood at all times is 98% to 99% saturated with oxygen 
when it leaves the lungs. What does happen with deep breathing 
is that the carbon dioxide in your body is decreased. This 
decrease in carbon dioxide has a host of effects on the body.

Not only does deep breathing not increase oxygen, in fact it 
has the opposite effect. Because of the changes in the blood 
brought on by the decrease in carbon dioxide, the blood flow to 
the cortex of the brain is decreased by 30% to 50%.11

HYPERVENTILATION

Thi s  deep  b r ea th ing  i s  c a l l ed ,  hype rven t i l a t i on .  
Hyperventilation is central to many techniques of body work 
even though most of them do not acknowledge that they are 
actually using the body’s mechanism of hyperventilation. Even 
writers on body-based psychotherapy invent other names for 
what they are doing. Reich called it orgone. Lowen called it bio-
electricity, Kelly called it Radix. Yoga calls it prana. Deep 
brea th ing,  a l l  by  i t se l f ,  does  not  inherent ly  produce  
hyperventilation, it is also a matter of the speed of the breathing. 
For those among my readers who are medically oriented, 

11.This reduction is caused by local constriction of the arteries in the 
brain. The reduction effect has been known for decades, but the 
recent advent of fMRI has allowed its more accurate measure-
ment. While blood flow and thus oxygen is materially reduced, the 
metabolism of the brain (that is, its use of glucose) is unchanged. 
Just like an over-used muscle, the brain then locally produces lac-
tic acid. There is a some data suggesting that the major effect of 
this reduction in oxygen is on the production of and  response to 
the neuro-transmitter: GABA. This data, if verified by subsequent 
study, would explain the increase in emotion seen in hyperventila-
tion. 



Chapter 3, Approaching the work              59
hyperventilation is defined operationally as the pCO2 being 
below a particular level.

In a manner of speaking, hyperventilation is the foundation of 
body-based psychotherapy (including Reichian therapy). The 
effects of hyperventilation (see following table) explains most of 
what is observed in sessions. Obviously, hyperventilation alone 
is not sufficient to change the character. If hyperventilation alone 
were effective (without the exercises, the pressure, and the 
cognitive work) then it would be the universal technique of all 
psychotherapy. Hyperventilation is a base, but a base upon which 
body-based psychotherapy is the superstructure.

In addition to the reduction of blood flow and thus oxygen to 
the cortex of the brain, there are a number of other metabolic 
changes. The decrease of the carbon dioxide results in the blood 
becoming less acidic (i.e. respiratory alkalosis). This change in 
blood acidity then affects calcium, magnesium. potassium and 
phosphate from the intra-cellular space, the extra-cellular space 
and the blood. There is a decrease of ionized calcium (along with 
magnesium and   potassium ions) in the extra-cellular space and 
this is what causes the muscle spasms which can be brought on in 
sessions. Muscles require calcium to relax (that is, in a calcium 
deficiency the muscles tend to spasm). 

If you find that your muscles are cramping badly, there are 
two ways to correct this condition other than just waiting it out. 
You can try the swim kick exercise at page 292 in Part Two of 
the book and/or you might try adding a calcium & magnesium 
supplement to your diet.

The flow of potassium into the blood and thus away from the 
nerves is the main cause of the frequent reports of paresthesia 
(tingling or electric currents). Nerve conduction is dependent on 
extra-cellular and intra-cellular concentrations of calcium, 
potassium, and sodium.

Hyperventilation is a well studied phenomena in the medical 
literature. Here is a table of common effects of hyperventilation:

Muscle spasm, most often of the hands and wrist



60 Reichian technique, Part One     

The use of hyperventilation has often been made a part of 
religious practices. Because of the change of the body boundary 

Paresthesia (tingling or the feeling that ants are crawling 
on the skin or that there are electric currents in the body)

Light-headedness, giddiness

Ringing in the ears

Blurred vision

Pain around the heart

Dry mouth

Twitching of the muscles, fine twitching or gross jerking

Cold and/or moist hands and/or feet

chest feels expanded or tight and contracted

parts of your body feel very relaxed or tense

strange tastes or smells

change in sensitivity of parts of your 
body to the feel of the body or to temperature

yawning

Lowered blood sugar

Slower reaction times

Slight modification of depth perception

Anxiety, sometimes extreme resulting in panic attacks

Sadness, sometimes strong resulting in weeping

Anger, sometimes strong

Elation or euphoria

change of body boundary (Freud’s “oceanic feeling”)

a general tendency to increased emotion

changes in vision including seeing flashes of light (with the
eyes closed) and hallucinations



Chapter 3, Approaching the work              61
and the  euphor ia  tha t  i s  o f ten  exper ienced  a f te r  the  
hyperventilation is stopped, the resultant state is often mis-
identified as “feeling open” or as “a mystical experience” or as 
“at one with the world.” 

An excellent recent article on the subject, called to my 
attention by Ovidiu Stoica to whom I express my gratitude, is 
“Alterations of consciousness, affectivity and blood gases during 
and after forced prolonged voluntary hyperventilation”12,13.

Because hyperventilation reduces visual acuity (especially 
depth perception), the ability to focus ones mind, and muscle 
coordination; it is very important that you not drive for at least 10 
minutes following a session.

I make it a point to tell every one of my patients, a minimum 
of three times, that they are not to drive for a least 10 minutes 
following a Reichian session.

MEDICAL NOTE

As noted in Chapter one (on page 28), if you have or might 
have epilepsy, deep breathing can bring on seizures so it is best 
for you to skip this type of self-improvement work. There are 
also reports in the medical literature of hyperventilation causing a 
heart attack. This is very rare, but I would be remiss to fail to 
men t i on  i t .  You  can  r ead  abou t  t h i s  a t :  h t t p : / /

13.The medical literature is quite clear on the subject of emotion and 
hyperventilation. The mere fact of prolonged hyperventilation 
results in a general tendency to emotion (likely due to the oxygen 
deprivation [hypoxia] of the cortex) and especially to crying 
(weeping), anxiety, and anger. 

DO NOT DRIVE FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES 
FOLLOWING A SESSION.



62 Reichian technique, Part One     

THROAT SOUNDS ON BREATHING

You’ve been breathing normally all your life and you’ve never 
made any throat sounds outside of talking or singing. What’s the 
big deal here?

Well, how about this claim: in over 35 years of practice of 
Reichian therapy, everyone of my patients starts the therapy 
making throat sounds on the inhale, the exhale, or both.

You will hear both of these on the Sounds of Reichian audio. 
OK, what is a throat sound and why is it present?

There is a single answer to  both questions. While, in fact, 
breathing is done with the diaphragm and the chest; in practice 
when people start doing the Reichian full deep breathing they 
treat it as though they were breathing into and out of the throat. 
On the Sounds of Reichian tape you will hear throat sounds still 
present in people who have been in the Reichian therapy for over 
two decades. If after two decades of therapy some people are still 
making throat sounds it must somehow be difficult to get rid of 
them. 

The issue is one of control. Once people start focusing on the 
breathing, it is almost automatic that they treat the issue as one of 
control. Normally, you are not even aware of your breathing. 
Now you are paying attention to your breathing and that means 
that the breathing is deliberate rather than automatic and 
unnoticed. You are now focusing on your inhale and your exhale 
and that, almost automatically, means you have to control each 
action. The method of control, which everyone uses before he 
learns to trust the body and not control, is to use his throat as the 
control point. He starts inhaling to the throat and exhaling from 
the throat. 

Interestingly, if you do the same belly-chest deep breathing 
through the nose instead of the mouth, this throat sound is not 
present. The reason why is easy to understand. Taking a deep 
breath through the nose you can already feel and sometimes even 
hear the air moving in and out, so you already have a point of 
control. Not so with mouth breathing. I can tell I am breathing in 
or out because I can hear the throat sounds. Having that throat 



Chapter 3, Approaching the work              63
sound allows me to know when I am inhaling and when I am 
exhaling. I am in control.

In reality the throat is simply a pipe from your mouth to your 
lungs. The vocal cords don’t change that. The vocal cords are no 
more than a narrowing of the open tube at one point.

There are a number of exercises that are specifically designed 
to teach the student to allow the breathing to be done directly and 
solely with the diaphragm and the chest. You will get these 
exercises in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. There are even exercises that 
are impossible to do if there is even a hint of a throat sound (for 
example, GASP INHALE BELLY on page 99). 

For the present, I would suggest that after you have read 
through this book the first time and prior to your beginning the 
second reading (as I discussed in Chapter one), that you listen to 
The Sounds of Reichian audio so that you can hear examples of 
the throat sounds and an example of breathing without throat 
sounds. 

But before you race to listen to that audio, I want yet again to 
emphasize that there are no tests in this course of study. If you 
treat this process of therapy as a test of performance, you will 
thoroughly defeat the work. The issue in character-change-based 
therapy is to allow, not to cause. Your objective is not to 
eliminate the throat sound (negative objective), it is to allow the 
body to operate without you demanding that it do what you will it 
to do and in the manner you demand. 

In all the issues and exercises in this therapy process there is a 
standard of performance, but if you convert that into a self-
imposed demand that you “do it properly” you are simply 
imposing a superego-based demand on the therapy and that 
demand will defeat the therapy (the superego issue is discussed in 
Chapter 23). 

The foundation of Reichian therapy is learning to 
allow. If you treat this therapy as an issue of 
“doing it properly,” you will defeat the therapy. 



64 Reichian technique, Part One     

The issue of breathing with no throat sound is addressed 
directly in Chapter eight. I have discussed the issue here so that 
you can learn to listen for the presence of the throat sound and 
begin the job of learning to breathe with the idea that your throat 
is just an open pipe leading to your lungs and has no other control 
function in this work.

YAWNING

Most animals, even humans, yawn. During your work you 
may find yourself yawning. There are many scientific 
explanations but no one explanation explains all the reasons why 
yawns occur. You may have heard that yawing means that you 
are bored or that you are sleepy or that you do not have enough 
oxygen. None of these three reasons is correct here. Among the 
explanations advanced to explain yawning, the one applicable 
here is that it indicates relaxation. As you relax from a pre-
session state of tension, the yawning indicates a relative state of 
relaxation.

Yawning has a special place in this work. Yawing has priority 
over any exercise. Any exercise is stopped in favor of a yawn. 
Further, the yawn gets a special sound. Shortly I will talk about 
the sound(s) to make as you exhale, but it is different for a yawn. 
A yawn gets as loud a sound as you can make. Exaggerate the 
sound. Yawning is a good sign and one of the best indicators that 
you are letting go of the chronic tension that serves to protect 
your nature.

Yawning takes precedence over any exercise. In 
doing any exercise in either Part One or Part 
Two, if you yawn stop the exercise for the yawn 
and give the yawn your full focus accompanied by 
a big big sound.



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    65

CHAPTER 4

PROPER BREATHING
 

The breathing is done in the working position (laying on your 
back, legs bent with the feet near the buttocks). Normal breathing 
is first belly and then chest in both inhale and exhale.

This is so important that I will repeat it: normal breathing is 
first belly, then chest on both inhale and exhale. 

If you have been instructed in yoga or Pilates or some other 
technique to breathe in any other way, drop that for this work. 

All the breathing is done through the mouth. No nose 
breathing. The eyes are open at all times. Note in the top 
photograph in Figure 13 on page 66 that the mouth is fully open, 
not just a little bit, while the bottom photograph shows the 
(minor) error of not opening the mouth fully during the breathing.

The exhale is begun with an easy ‘ah’ sound without first 
closing the throat. I will return to this issue repeatedly.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 

Some people hold their chest in a chronic inhale position. The 
chest is round and pulled up as though the person had already 
taken a deep breath. Other people hold their chest in a chronic 
exhale position. It is as though they had already pushed out all the 
air after an exhale. Examples are shown in Figure 14 on the next 
page. The photo on the left is an example of what is termed a 
barrel chest held in chronic inhale. The photo on the right is an 
example of the long thin chest held in chronic exhale.

Neither picture shows the extreme of the condition. The 
exemplars are ones available from my current patients.



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    67
Before you leap into right or wrong or justification for your 

chest shape; understand that (1) most people are in the middle 
and (2) there is no right or wrong in this. Whatever you are, that 
is what you are. There is no criticism and there is no praise. There 
is only fact. 

Both the person on the left and the person on the right have 
restricted breathing which they are trying to correct. But someone 
in the middle can be just as restricted in his breathing as either of 
the two people in the photos. 

As you read on, I will explain about chest movement. I will 
tell you how to measure it and how to correct any problems that 
you find.

That this issue is important, in fact central, to the work is 
plainly indicated by the fact that I have spent most all of Part One 
of this book just on just this issue of breathing. 

Figure 14

Both the chronic inhale (on the left) and the chronic exhale 
(on the right) chest shape need special work. I will tell you how 



68 Reichian technique, Part One     

to work with chest shapes  in Chapter six, but before you get to 
the working on chest shapes you need to learn the breathing 
exercises and get reasonably good at them.

First I will discuss the technical aspects of chest movement. 
You really do need the information on chest movement. Next I 
will present the detailed information on proper breathing. Next, 
all the exercises and  finally the special steps to take to free up the 
chronic inhale or chronic exhale chest.

HOW BREATHING OCCURS 

There are physically two ways to inhale. Together they form a 
complete proper breath. 

Belly or abdominal breathing occurs when the diaphragm is 
tensed. When your diaphragm is tensed, your abdomen expands 
(balloons out). This is the first step in a full breath. This is more 
fully explained below.  

Chest breathing occurs when the chest is expanded. In proper 
breathing this is accomplished by the muscles between the ribs. 
This is the second step in a full breath. 

Some people breathe only with the diaphragm, some people 
breathe only with the chest. Proper breathing involves first belly 
then chest on the inhale and first belly then chest on the exhale.

Even though I will discuss it more fully below, I want to state 
from the beginning that chest breathing involves expansion of 
the chest, not raising of the chest. When the chest expands, it will 
seem to rise; but it is expansion that we want, not raising. 

BREATHING INVOLVES
1. flattening the diaphragm
2. expanding the chest



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    69

THE MUSCLES OF BREATHING 

BELLY BREATHING, THE DIAPHRAGM

The diaphragm is a bell-shaped muscle. It attaches to the 
lower ribs in the front and then plunges down to the mid back 
region in the back. Figure 15 on page 70 shows the diaphragm in 
cross section when it is relaxed and when it is contracted.

Note that since the diaphragm is bell shaped, when it contracts 
it flattens.

When the bell-shaped diaphragm flattens, that is contracts 
during an inhale, the air is sucked into the lungs. 

The space below the diaphragm is the abdomen. That space is 
compacted by the flattening of the diaphragm and has to respond 
by ballooning out the belly. So when you breathe with the 
diaphragm your belly expands and your lungs expand. Please 
remember: air is sucked in by the flattening of the diaphragm. 
In fact you do not breathe in, you flatten the diaphragm and 
the air is sucked in to fill the space where the diaphragm was. 
This may seem like a small point, but actually if you incorporate 
this idea into your thinking about breathing, it changes the way 
you breathe.

THE DIAPHRAGM
bell shaped
flattens in inhale: we don’t breathe in, we flatten the

diaphragm and that causes a vacuum which
causes air to be pulled in



70 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 15

As you do the work, try to think about breathing 
not as inhaling the air, but as expanding the abdo-
men and the chest. We naturally, but erroneously, 
think about inhaling as drawing the air in. That 
thought, in turn, tends to cause people to control 
their breathing by tension in their throat. That is 
kind of a natural thought. But if you keep in mind 
that all you are doing is expanding your belly and 
expanding your chest then you will learn more 
quickly to let go of artificial control.



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    71

CHEST BREATHING, THE RIBS

As you can see in Figure 16 between all of your ribs there are 
two sets of muscles, the external intercostal muscles and the 
internal intercostal muscles. The suffix “costal” in intercostal is 
just another name for rib.

Figure 16

The external intercostal muscles are used during inhalation. 
They extend from about under the nipple line around back all the 
way to the spine.

The internal intercostal muscles are used during (forced) 
expiration. They run from your breast bone around the side and to 
about mid back.

THE CHEST
muscles between the ribs
expands (not rises) during inhale because of the

placement of the ribs



72 Reichian technique, Part One     

Now think about your ribs for a moment. If you can’t picture 
the rib cage, run your finger along your lower rib from your side, 
first coming forward to your breast bone and then backward 
toward your spine. The ribs are fixed in front at the breastbone 
and in back at the spine. Note that the ribs come down toward 
your feet as they come from the spine and then go back up to 
reach the breast bone. 14

When the external intercostal muscles contract during inhale 
the 2nd rib is pulled up toward the first rib, the 3rd toward the 
second and so on. Because of the shape of the ribs, as the ribs 
move upward, they move outward, thus expanding the chest. As 
your chest expands the air is sucked into your lungs. On the 
exhale the ribs return to their resting position and this pushes the 
air out.

But there is another way that people (wrongly) breathe into the 
chest and we will look at that next.

14.For the punctilious among my readers, yes I am aware that there 
are seven other muscles that effect chest breathing. Two is enough 
for our purposes here.

I’ll repeat all this once for emphasis because as you’ll 
see in the next section, all this is important. You do not 
really inhale; you only create vacuums in your body 
and the air gets sucked in to fill the vacuum. One vac-
uum is created when you flatten (that is, contract) the 
diaphragm (and balloon out the belly) and the other 
vacuum is created when you expand the chest. 



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    73

ACCESSORY MUSCLES OF CHEST BREATHING

There are other muscles which can be used in breathing. If 
these muscles (see below) are used continuously you must undo 
this habit. These other muscles — other than those between the 
ribs —  are called accessory muscles of respiration.

The accessory muscles, in healthy breathing,  are used only 
during physical or emotional emergencies. If you are using them 
all the time it means you are operating at all times as though there 
were an emergency. You are literally approaching life as though 
it were an emergency situation. If you have trouble relaxing, 
trouble with anger, trouble with letting go, you approach sex as a 
demand performance; that way of being in the world can be 
explained by the fact that you are dealing with all of life as an 
emergency. 

These accessory muscles are on the upper chest (the 
pectorals), on the front of the neck (the sternocleidomastoid), on 
the side of the neck (the scalenes),  and on the upper back (the 
trapezius). Unfortunately, most people, when they breathe into 
the chest, use these accessory muscles. Later I will tell you how 
to see if you are using the accessory muscles. If you are using 
these muscles or can not breathe into your chest, for now simply 
be aware of the issue and let the exercises do a lot of the 
correction. 

So much is accomplished just by the use of the exercises that 
you can leave the accessory muscle issue to later. At this point I 
simply want to explain the accessory muscles so that you can 
become aware of whether you are using them.

In broad strokes, we have three ways of chest breathing:

a. improper use of the diaphragm.

ACCESSORY MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION
pushing the chest up with the diaphragm
measuring the chest with a tape measure
PARADOXICAL BREATHING



74 Reichian technique, Part One     

b. improper use of the accessory muscles
c. proper use of the muscles between the ribs

THE DIAPHRAGM AS AN ACCESSORY MUSCLE

Though it may seem a bit strange, the chest can be pushed up 
from the bottom by the diaphragm15. This is inappropriate. It 
would really get technical if I tried to explain how this is done, so 
I will just leave it that it is done by all too many people. Later in 
Part One of this book I will tell you how to see if you are doing 
this and what to do to correct it. 

THE OTHER ACCESSORY MUSCELS

You want to learn to breathe with the diaphragm (for the belly 
part of breathing) and the muscles between the ribs  (for the chest 
part of breathing). You can tell if you are using your diaphragm 
during the inhale because your belly will balloon out. If you get 
no movement in the chest then you know you are not using it at 
all. But if you do have chest movement, then is it with the rib 
muscles or is it with the accessory muscles?

The first thing to know is whether your chest is or is not 
moving. If it is moving, then are you pushing it up with the 
diaphragm? If you are not pushing it up, then are you using the 
right muscles to expand it or the wrong muscles to only move it? 

BREATHING PROPERLY INTO THE CHEST?

MEASURING THE CHEST

There are two simple methods to tell if you are expanding 
your chest rather than pushing it up from the diaphragm or 
pulling it up using the accessory muscles of respiration.

15.In the most extreme case of this that I have seen, this person’s 
lower rib actually flared outward producing what is medically 
called a “Harrison’s sulcus.” 



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    75
The best way to see if you are expanding the chest is to use a 

simple tape measure, the kind used by tailors and dressmakers to 
measure the body. You can also use a piece of string but you can 
tell more if you stop by the store and pick up a tape measure. 

Place the tape measure or string around your chest as shown in 
Figure 17 left and pinch the tape measure (string) against itself 
with two fingers. 

You can also use your hands with the your index fingers 
touching and you thumb hooked around your ribs as in Figure 17
right.

Figure 17

When you do a proper chest inhale, the tape measure (or your 
hands) should pull apart showing that  the chest size is increasing 
(Figure 18 on page 76 shows use first of the hands and then the 
tape measure).

If the size of the chest (as measured by your hands or the tape 
measure) does not increase then either you have no chest 
breathing or you are using the accessory muscles of respiration or 
you are using the diaphragm to push the chest up. The issues of 
using the accessory muscles of respiration or using the 
diaphragm to push up the chest are discussed in Chapter seven. 
Also if you can work with a helper, Chapter nine provides extra 
exercises and techniques to further the work.

The amount of movement, assuming there is some, varies 
corresponding to your chest shape. There are two basic chest 
shapes: the long thin shape (like many rock musicians) and the 
barrel  shape ( l ike weight  l i f ters)  (see INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES  on page 66) The amount of the increase in chest 
expansion will vary with the chest shape. With a long thin chest it 



76 Reichian technique, Part One     

may be only one half inch, with the barrel chest it should be at 
least an inch. Note that the tape measure in Figure 18 shows an 
expansion from 35 3/16 inches to 36 11/16 or an expansion of 1 
1/2 inches. While the expansion in Figure 19 on page 77 is only 
5/8 inches.

PARADOXICAL BREATHING 

I have emphasized that breathing, both inhale and exhale, is 
first belly and then chest. Some people breathe with the opposite 
pattern: they first breathe into the chest and then into the belly. 
This is called “paradoxical breathing.” 

If you do breathe in this paradoxical manner, it can take some 
time to correct; but it is important. The goal of all these exercises 
is to get rid of the chronic state of tension in your muscles. 
Getting rid of this chronic tension will result in major changes in 
you as a person.

Proper breathing will result, over time, in relaxing the 
diaphragm. Paradoxical breathing will result, over time, with 
tensing the diaphragm. 

If you do find that you are using paradoxical breathing as your 
normal way of breathing then, without question, your first 
objective in learning to breathe is learning to breathe in the 
correct order. That is job one.

There is also a variant of this paradoxical breathing that I need 
to mention so that you can watch for it. This happens when you 
breathe into the belly first, but then when you start the chest 
inhale you draw the belly in (that is, you collapse or tense the 



78 Reichian technique, Part One     

belly). After you breathe into the belly it should stay ballooned 
out during the chest inhale.  Figure 20, on the left, shows the 

Figure 20

proper belly out at the end of the inhale and on the right, the belly 
was contracted during or after the inhale.

You can test to feel if you are contracting or have a tendency 
to contract the belly after the inhale by placing your hands on the 
upper abdomen just below the breast bone. That hand placement 
will allow you to feel whether you are tensing the abdomen 
during the inhale to the chest. This is shown in Figure 21

.

Figure 21



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    79
 

SOUNDS

The exhale should start with an easy, soft, and short sound. 
That means don’t emphasize or drag out the sound. The proper 

sound has been compared to a sigh, not a moan but just a short 
‘sigh’ sound.

I have tried in the audio that accompanies this book to 
illustrate all the sounds. Since I was limited to my current 
Reichian therapy population and myself, some sounds are not as 
diverse as I would have liked.16

AH

You know how the doctor says: “open your mouth and say 
ah.” That’s the sound I want you to begin with. But unlike at the 
doctor’s office, don’t drag it out! The sound starts the exhale, it 
does not continue. 

The ‘ah’ sound is actually a slight mimic of the sound of a 
sigh. It is true that some people sigh with a ‘huh’ sound; but if 
you try both you will, hopefully, feel the difference. You want 
the ‘ah’ not the ‘huh.’ You can hear various versions of the ‘ah’ 
sound on the audio that accompanies this book. I also provide an 
example of what the proper ‘ah’ sound is.

One more thing. In language there are two elements called 
articulation and guttural. In articulation the throat is first closed 
and then opened to make the sound. If you try that on yourself 
hopefully you can both do it and hear the difference. In a guttural 
sound a constriction of the throat is added to the sound.

First, take a small breath. Next close your throat (you can tell 
if you throat is closed because you can try to exhale but you can’t 

16.Many of my patients are only in verbal therapy. Reichian therapy, 
like any other therapy, is not applicable to everyone.

RIGHT SOUNDS: ah
WRONG SOUNDS: uh, huh, ha, hu, who, ga, ugh



80 Reichian technique, Part One     

since the passage for the air is closed). Then make the ‘ah’ sound 
as you open your throat. Hopefully you can hear the slight grunt 
like sound at the beginning of the ‘ah’ sound. This can be quite 
subtle, but it is definitely there. It is good practice to do the 
closed throat and the open throat exhales a bunch of times until 
you get good at spotting the difference.

UH, HUH, HA, HU, WHO, GA, UGH 

It is impressive how many sounds we can make that are close 
to ‘ah’ but not on the money. Above is a list of the most common 
ones. It is a good exercise to deliberately make each of the above 
sounds compared to the ‘ah’ to be able to tell the difference. For 
each sound, do not accentuate the difference. Try to make each of 
the above sounds as close to the ‘ah’ sound as you can so that you 
can learn to hear the difference. 

One little trick is to drag out the wrong sounds above on your 
exhale because that helps you to begin to really hear the 
difference. The most common, even if relatively minor, error is to 
use ‘ha’ rather than ‘ah’. Think of it this way: you are not 
laughing, you are relaxing. So it is not 'ha' as in a laugh but ‘ah’ 
as in a sigh.

Make sure that you do not drag out the sound. I have tried to 
illustrate these different sounds on the accompanying sound track 
for this book (or CD if the book is commercially published).

The ‘ah’ sound is not so much started and stopped as it is just 
inserted into the stream of air at the beginning of the exhale. For 
a time as you learn to do this work it might be a good idea to get 
a cheap tape recorder and record your breathing and the sound. 
See if perhaps you start with an ‘ah’ but then change as you go 
along to some other sound. It might be that you are starting the 
exhale and then sometime after you start exhaling you insert the 
sound. That is, you are not starting the exhale with a sound but 
are rather stopping the exhale, then adding a sound as you 
continue the exhale. 

So what’s the big deal? Why do I make so much out of one 
sound or another? Well, some things are seemingly small things 
but they make a big difference in the effectiveness of the work 
while other things (really, errors) are not so important. It is not a 



Chapter 4, Proper breathing                    81
major error if you say ‘ha’ instead of ‘ah’, but it is a major error 
to add an articulation or a guttural and say ‘ga’ or ‘ugh’ or to drag 
out the sound. It is really not hard to get the sound right and once 
you get used to it, it becomes automatic and you don’t have to 
think about it any more; but it does meaningfully impact the work 
if you don’t learn the right sound. Just take the time when you 
start the work to learn the right way to do it.

PAUSES IN BREATHING

There is another common breath issue that I want to mention 
here. Most people when they start these exercises breathe as a 
two-step process.  They inhale, pause, then exhale, pause, then 
inhale. They think of a breath as an inhale followed by an exhale. 
Properly it is one continuous operation. The inhale gives rise to 
the exhale which gives rise to the inhale. I will return to this later 
when I discuss rhythmic breathing, I just wanted to mention it 
here so that you are alerted from the start. 

Learning to breathe as one continuous process rather than a 
two step process – (1) inhale, (2) exhale – is not that easy. Treat 
this as a goal not as a mandate. It takes some people many years 
to learn the one process breath. Just to make sure I am not 
misunderstood, the first issues are things like the ‘ah’ sound and 
the belly-chest sequence rather than the more advanced issue of 
the continuous breath. 

Don’t pause between the inhale and the exhale

CHAPTER 5

THE BREATHING WORK EXERCISES

 INTRODUCTION 

Some of these exercises are basic. They are usually not hard to 
do but yield great results. Other exercises are harder but that only 
means that they have even greater effect.

Master the initial exercises before you go to more advanced 
ones. In all cases you should recognize that your objective is to 
benefit from the exercises not to treat them as some kind of 
demand and that you have failed if you can not do it. 

I’ve said before and I say again: proper breathing is very 
powerful and that you should never push yourself. The rule is: 
ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY.

I have presented these exercises in the generally proper 
sequence. The actual order of use may vary as you get experience 
with them. Human beings, being very mixed up animals, have a 
built-in tendency to demand super-hero status. 

To put it bluntly, you are not a super hero; and if you continue 
to demand that you be one and thus overdo these exercises or 
jump to advanced work before you are done with the earlier 
work, well, welcome to chaos. That’s what you will get: chaos in 
your life. ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY.

BREATHE 

Just try to breathe properly as discussed above. Stay at this 
level until you (1) do not get any extreme cramping and (2) you 
can tolerate a full hour of the breathing. It is very natural to want 
to push on to the breathing exercises presented below. Resist the 
temptation. It is very surprising how few people can actually 
breathe properly. Here is a little check list to summarize what I 
have said so far:

Once you have mastered this basic breathing you are ready to 
start with the exercises. Don’t rush it. Give yourself time to just 
get the basic breathing. It may sound stupidly easy – and it might 
be for some readers, some students – but from over 35 years of 
experience, it is, as the phrase is, easier said than done. Try to just 
stay with the basic issue of proper breathing until it is natural for 
you to breathe that way and then you can proceed onto the 
exercises. 

1. breathe first into the belly
2. breathe second into the chest
3. do not tighten or contract the belly when you

breathe into the chest
4. make the breath one continuous motion; belly inhale,

chest inhale, belly exhale, chest exhale. All with
no pauses

5. be able to tolerate this good breathing one hour



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  85

BREATHE BELLY ONLY 

In this exercise you are breathing only into the belly. The 
chest is not used. The objective is to make sure you can breathe 
only with the belly and that the belly breathing is full.

There are two big obstacles to belly breathing: (1) the 
diaphragm is chronically tense and can not move well, and (2) the 
abdominal muscles are chronically tense and can not release their 
tension. 

At this point some of you might object that: I exercise daily 
and one of the major goals is to tighten my abdominal muscle to 
get that chiseled look. Although this seems as if it might get in 
the way of full abdominal breathing, it does not. There is a 
difference between a muscle having tone and a muscle being 
tonic. In tone a muscle maintains a healthy degree of tension but 
can relax when it is not in use. When a muscle is tonic the muscle 
can not relax even when it is not in use.

When you stand up your abdominal muscles serve a postural 
function; they must have a degree of tension. When you lay down 
on your back, your abdominal muscles no longer have a postural 
function and they should be able to relax. In other words: tone is 
good, chronic tension (tonic) is not.

For many people with very tight abdominal muscles, there is 
limited ability to let the tension pass when it is not structurally 
needed. Thus their ability to breathe into the belly is limited by 
the tension of the abdominal muscles. 

The difficult thing to describe is: how big is the abdomen, how 
does it look when the tension is released during a belly only 
breath? The only way I can begin to describe that is by reference 
to a picture (Figure 22). Neither of our models could fully expand 

Problems:

2. the belly is chronically tense

his belly, but  the picture gives you at least some idea of what an 
expanded belly looks like.

Figure 22

Figure 23

Notice the difference between the abdominal expansion in 
Figure 22 and Figure 23. The residual tension in the lower 
abdomen in Figure 23 is conventionally interpreted as sexual 
anxiety.17

17. The reader needs to be aware that all statements in psychology are 
statistical statements. That is, any interpretation (like the above on 
sexual anxiety) is not a fact (100% true), it is a statistical statement 
meaning that there is only a possibility that it is true in any given 
instance.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  87
I’ve spent this time on the abdominal muscle, but recall that 

another problem with belly breathing is tonicity (chronic tension) 
of the diaphragm. I’ll tell you what to feel for; however, this can 
also take a lot of practice with different body types. Thus it may 
well be the case that you cannot feel it. If you are unable to judge 
diaphragm tension, simply treat it as part of the overall belly 
breathing issue. If you can do a full belly breath it means that 
your diaphragm is properly mobile even if you can’t feel it.

In Figure 24 I show you how you can place two fingers at the 
base of the ribs to feel for diaphragmatic movement. You can see 
in the picture how the two fingers should be against the lower rib 
and angled very slightly upward.

With the fingers properly placed and pointed in the right 
direction, start breathing into the belly. You should be able to feel 
the diaphragm move under you fingers. It feels something like a 
soft ridge moving beneath your fingers. 

It is surprising how many people can not breathe with the 
belly without also involving the chest. Our objective is to free 
both the abdomen and the chest from tonicity. To accomplish that 
you must be able to separate the two parts of the breath cycle. 
You must be able to breathe with the belly only and with the 
chest only.

Figure 24

In the following picture I show you how to place you hand 
against your chest and the bed. If your chest is moving you will 
be able to feel it with your finger 



88 Reichian technique, Part One     

In Figure 25 you can see from the line I have drawn on the 
photograph that the chest is raising (is pulled up by the accessory 
muscles). Thus this model, despite instructions by me to breathe 
only with his belly, is unable to not use his chest in the breath. 

Do not short-circuit this exercise. It is important and should be 
given as much time as needed to be able to not only do it (with 
much effort and concentration), but to do it easily and naturally. 
Initially you likely will be concentrating on doing it right. Your 
goal, however, is not only to do it properly but also naturally. 
Your final goal is to be able to do this just as naturally as if it 
were walking. 

Figure 25



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  89

BREATHE CHEST ONLY 

We have belly only breathing and we have chest only 
breathing. It is usually more difficult to breathe chest only than it 
is to breathe belly only. Here I present the chest only breathing 
and in the following two exercises I present ways to help you free 
up your chest.

The goal is for you to have access to individual groups of 
muscles, to be able to separate different muscle groups. If you 
have a problem with using the accessory muscles of respiration 
or a problem because you use your diaphragm to push the chest 
up, you will work on that separately. The fact of either or both of 
these problems does not prevent you learning to breathe chest 
only, to separate the chest breathing from the belly breathing. 

On  page  66 ,  unde r  t he  head ing  “ INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES,” I wrote about different chest shapes. There I 
introduced you to the idea that in some people the chest is held 
down in chronic exhale while in other people the chest is held up 
in chronic inhale. Figure 14 on page 67 showed examples of a 
model with a barrel chest held up (in chronic inhale) and of a 
model with a long thin chest held down (in chronic exhale).

Now even if your chest is held up – and thus you can not get 
much air into your chest since it is already up in chronic inhale 
position – you can still practice this exercise. You do not need to 
wait until you get the chest down before you do this one.

Introduction
The goal is to be able to breathe only with the belly and

only with the chest
Different chest shapes (chronic inhale and chronic 

exhale) and use of the accessory muscles need
not stop you

Two common problems
1. tensing the abdomen before the chest inhale
2. tensing the abdomen at the end of the chest

inhale



90 Reichian technique, Part One     

There are two common mistakes in chest only breathing. 
The fist common mistake is to tense the abdomen before the 

chest inhale is started. Figure 26 is an example of tensing the 
abdomen. So, starting at the point of a finished exhale, before you 
even start the inhale, you will see tensing of the upper abdomen 
just below the ribs. This prior tensing of the abdomen is usually 
associated with using the diaphragm to push the chest up.

The second common mistake is to do the majority of the 
inhale with the chest with no abdominal tensing but near the end 
of the chest only breath, the abdomen is tensed to allow more air 
into the chest. This action, too, has the function of using the 
diaphragm to add more air to the chest inhale. 

Recall that you can use a tape measure to see that the chest is 
expanding. But perhaps the best easy test is to place your hands 
flat on the abdomen to check for tensing of the abdomen (Figure 
27).

Figure 26



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  91

Figure 27

If you have a long thin chest held in chronic exhale and can 
not get it to move use the next exercise (extend belly, breathe 
chest only). If you have a barrel chest held up in chronic inhale, 
then use the push breathing exercise to get it down. I discuss the 
push breathing exercise on page 94.

Don’t short-circuit this exercise either. Proper breathing is so 
powerful all by itself in effecting change in the your nature that 
you should never rush from one exercise to the next. ALWAYS 
TOO SLOWLY.

EXTEND THE BELLY, BREATHE CHEST ONLY 

This sounds easy, but it is a beauty. It is the best exercise there 
is for (1) learning to not use the diaphragm to push up the chest, 
(2) learning to breathe with only the chest. This exercise will not 
teach you to not use the accessory muscles of respiration. This

exercise is applicable for everyone but it is THE exercise to use 
for people with a long thin chest to get the chest up.

At this point, I would like to add a note. All the material in 
both parts of this book are NOT calisthenics or a health club 
workout. The goal, purpose, and effect of all these exercises – 
both here and in Part Two – is to change your nature and develop 
more personal freedom and enjoyment.

It would be nice if I could explain all this; but that would be a 
technical  discussion with lots of theory and lots of references. 
All I can say here, and emphasize as well, is that it will happen. It 
will not happen quickly, nor does one want it to happen quickly; 
but continued and conscientious use of these exercises will do 
that.

It is not uncommon for people doing these exercises to have 
various feelings, from laughing to crying and everything in 
between18. In fact, some of the exercises in the two part of this 
book are designed to accomplish exactly that. But it is not 
emotion that we are  after. If some emotion occurs, let it 
continue; but only to your personal point of comfort. Allow the 
emotion to grow and spread throughout your body, but don’t 
push yourself. This is not a contest and it is not a performance. 
Feeling is appropriate, but it is not our goal. Our goal is character 
change, not emotional fireworks.

If your chest is mobile (remember: that’s when the tape 
measure shows the chest expanding during the inhale), this 
exercise is usually pretty easy. If your chest is held down, held 
up, or you use your diaphragm to push the chest up, this exercise 
will be both hard and exhausting.

If it is hard, it only means it is more important; but it also 
means don’t push it. Do as much as you can and then pass on to 
another exercise. There is always the next time. 

The technique is easy. First, breathe with your diaphragm, 
extending your belly as much as you possibly can. If you can, get 
it down to the bottom of your abdomen, down to the pelvis so 
that your whole belly is one big round balloon.

18.See the chart on hyperventilation (pages 59-60) for emotions fre-
quently seen with hyperventilation.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  93
Now holding your belly out, breathe into the chest. Take as 

big a breath as you can, but only into the chest. Do not let your 
belly contract or tense even a little. Exhale normally with the 
easy ‘ah’ sound and normal speed. This sounds easy, it is not. 
Years of experience have shown the author just how difficult this 
is for most people.

It is natural to think that contracting the abdomen during the 
belly-out-chest-only breath would mean that the whole abdomen 
tenses. This is not the case. Some people do contract or tense the 
whole abdomen, but others contract only the top of the abdomen 
below the ribs and others contract only the bottom of the 
abdomen in the pelvic region. While Figure 28 does not show the 
belly extended, it does show hand placement you can use to tell if 
your belly contracts (after being expanded) during the chest 
inhale part of the breath.

PUSH BREATHING 

As the ‘belly-out-breathe-chest-only’ is the big exercise for 
getting the chest up, so this is the big exercise for getting the 
chest down. Everyone should be able to do both of these 
exercises but the belly-out breathe with the chest is the big 
exercise for people with a long thin chest in chronic exhale and 
this exercise is the big one for people with a barrel chest in 
chronic inhale.

This exercise must be done correctly. There are various 
important reasons why this exercise must be done with caution. 
Also this exercise can be physically exhausting so another reason 
not to overdo it. 

At this point in the narrative — and much out of order since I 
will repeat all this in Part Two of the book — I am going to 
introduce you to the proper way to roll the pelvis. The only 
reason I am doing this now is that you might as well learn about 
this here and perhaps start to get it right. But rolling the pelvis is 
really its own exercise and here it is only that the rolled pelvis is 
essential (though the rolling technique is not essential here) to

this exercise. What that implies is that at this point in your work 
focus on this push breathing exercise and simply keep in mind 
that this is not a bad place to also start to learn the proper way to 
do the roll the pelvis exercise.

MEDICAL NOTE

As noted in Chapter one (on page 29), this exercise raises the 
pressure inside the brain cavity (the inter-cranial pressure). This 
can result in death for those who have a silent aneurism in their 
brain. If you have had an amphetamine habit, don’t do this 
exercise. Also there is a genetic condition called a “berry 
aneurism.” It is rare, but it is also silent until it ruptures. There is 
a medical way to test for the presence of a brain aneurism, but 
you are very unlikely to get any physician to prescribe it absent 
any present medical indication of its need.

There is also a medical issue if you have elevated blood 
pressure. Many pharmacies have a free blood pressure test stand 
that you can use, or you can purchase an automated blood 
pressure device at the pharmacy. If you have a doctor, then your 
blood pressure is in your medical records and you can call your 
doctor’s office to get the values.

If you are on medication that is reducing your blood pressure 
to a normal value, then this exercise should be OK. If you are in 
doubt, ask your treating physician. Because he might easily 
misunderstand what you are doing, this exercise IS NOT the 
same as a valsalva maneuver.

THE EXERCISE

That said, here is the exercise. After a normal breath, at the 
beginning of the exhale – at the same time you are making the 
‘ah’ sound – you roll the pelvis up. This reads as something 
quite easy to do. At the start of the exhale, you roll the pelvis up 
at the same time you are making the ‘ah’ sound to start the 
exhale. 

There are a bunch of errors that are made with the roll the 
pelvis part of this exercise. I’ll deal here only with the ones 



96 Reichian technique, Part One     

important for this exercise and save the complete discussion for 
Chapter 18.

Later in this book I will have a section on the issue of control. 
People who have the character need to control everything find it 
difficult to do two things at the same time. That is, they find it 
d i f f icu l t  to  make a  sound and ro l l  a t  the  same t ime.  
Characterlogically they need to make sure that they make the ‘ah’ 
sound correctly before they can turn their attention to rolling the 
pelvis. If you have this issue because of your need to control, 
simply be aware of the issue and over time as you do the work in 
this book including this exercise you can gradually overcome that 
character limitation and you will be able to roll and vocalize at 
the same time.

One error in the operation of rolling the pelvis is that instead 
of the pelvis being rolled up, it is jerked up. The motion should 
be smooth, not jerky. Again this relates to the character issue of 
control and again will be corrected over time as you do the work.

Now to the three errors that are significant. In one error the 
whole lower body is raised so that the lower back lifts off the 
bed. Figure 29 shows before the roll (left) and after a proper roll 
(right). 

Figure 29

Then Figure 30 shows the back being raised off the bed. In 
other words, instead of the pelvis being rolled, it is lifted.  



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  97

Figure 30

In the second error the legs are separated when the pelvis is 
rolled. The legs should not spread apart during the roll. This error 
is shown in Figure 31.

Figure 31

In the third error the pelvis is rolled by tensing the abdominal 
muscles instead of using the frontal thigh muscles to roll the 
pelvis. I can’t very well illustrate this error with a photograph 
since the tightening of the abdominal muscles is too slight to 
show up in a photo. But, again, by placing your hand on the 



98 Reichian technique, Part One     

lower abdomen and pressing in slightly during the exercise, you 
can feel if the muscles tense when you roll the pelvis.

In rolling the pelvis (1) only the pelvis tilts, the lower back 
does not lift from the bed, (2) the legs do not pull apart and (3) 
the roll is done at the same time as the exhale begins with the ‘ah’ 
sound.

Now the exercise. At the beginning of the exhale roll the 
pelvis and keep it up until the exhale is completed. Exhale 
normally (belly, chest). At the END of the exhale stick out 
(balloon out) the belly completely and then squeeze out all the air 
from the chest. I do mean all the air. Keep pushing the air out 
until it is simply not possible that there is any left. Then lower 
(not drop) the pelvis and begin the normal inhale.

In doing the push there are two common errors you want to try 
to avoid. The first error is that the belly is ballooned out almost 
immediately instead of only at the very end of the normal exhale. 
In learning this exercise, just practice the issue that the exhale is 
normal (belly then chest) until the normal end of the exhale and it 
is only at the end that the belly is expanded or ballooned out and 
the rest of the air pushed out.

The other error is that as the chest is tensed in the attempt to 
push out all the air, the upper abdomen is also tensed. You can 
feel if  you do that by using your hand resting on the abdomen 
(Figure 28 on page 93). You should not feel any movement and 
you should not feel any tensing of the muscle. If you do have this 
habit, it is hard to break and will simply take a lot of practice. 

One thing NOT to do in this exercise is to let the session 
continue on too long. Since you are learning to use the muscles 
between the ribs and that alone is tiring, the more you do this 
exercise the more you will tire and have a tendency to return to 
tensing the abdominal muscle. So keep the exercise going only as 
long as you can do the push exhale without tensing the abdomen. 
Then come back to it on the next learning session. 

At the beginning of the exhale roll the pelvis and 
keep it up until the exhale is completed.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  99
The first time you may do only a few breaths before you tire 

so much that you start to tense the abdomen. OK, then stop until 
the next session. Life is a process, not a test of stupidity (that is, a 
test of endurance). 

That’s all there is to it. Sound simple? Wait till you try to do it. 
It is hard and tiring. If you have a held high chest, you need this 
exercise to get it down. Even if you have a properly mobile chest 
this exercise will be useful to increase the mobility in your chest.

GASP INHALE BELLY 

Obviously you can’t start on the gasp inhale belly exercise 
until you have mastered the belly only breathing.

As simple as this exercise seems in description, it is intensely 
powerful when done correctly and fully. A gasp is an extremely 
short inhale (or later, exhale). Listen to the audio for examples. 
One final point: while the inhale is a gasp, the exhale is normal. 
The sound is still the soft ‘ah’ and the time of the exhale is the 
normal amount of time.

To be started only after you have mastered the belly only 
breathing
Issues:

1. the chest is not involved in the inhale
2. the gasp is extremely short
3. the effect of the gasp goes all the way down to

the pelvis

1. Start with a normal inhale
2. At the start of the exhale,

a. make the normal ‘ah’ sound and
b. roll the pelvis

3. keep the pelvis up for the whole exhale
4. AT THE END of the exhale, stick out the belly and
5. push all the air out of your chest



100 Reichian technique, Part One     

There are three things to be concerned with here; and you will 
not master all of these things at the same time so don’t try. It 
takes practice and a real willingness to let it happen. The three 
issues are: (1) the chest is not involved in the breath, (2) the gasp 
is extremely short, (3) the ‘percussive’ effect gets all the way 
down to the pelvis. 

1) THE CHEST IS NOT INVOLVED

I have listed this issue first because if you involve the chest in 
your gasp inhale belly you will never, in fact, be able to gasp 
properly. Therefore the first issue to practice is that you can gasp 
into the belly without having the chest move. 

Many people, when they first start this exercise, actually start 
with a mini-inhale to the chest before they gasp inhale to the 
belly. You have already learned to do chest only and belly only 
breathing. Now you have to master doing a rapid belly breath 
without re-involving the chest in the breath. Just work to get the 
inhale as rapid as possible (and as full as possible) without any 
use of the chest. 

2) THE GASP IS EXTREMELY SHORT

Now I can turn to the issue of what a ‘gasp’ is.  
As best I can put it in words and audio, the gasp is nearly 

instantaneous. It is not rapid, it is not quick, it is not short; it is a 
gasp. A good estimate is that the complete inhale is finished in 
1/4 of a second. Let’s put it this way: it can’t be too short 
provided that you inhale fully. 

Try this trick to get an idea of what speed a gasp goes at. Do a 
complete exhale. Now balloon out your belly as far as possible 
without letting in any air (that is, keep your throat closed). 
Attempt to get that belly really far out, a really big round 
abdomen; from the ribs all the way down to the pelvis. The photo 
below is the better of the two models for expanding the belly. 
But, note that the expansion is really quite limited and he is 
unable to expand the belly all the way down to the pelvis. His 
abdomen comes in sharply before it gets to the pelvic area.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  101
 

Figure 32

When you have that, then open your throat to let the air be 
sucked in to fill the chest. This is a good approximation of what a 
gasp is like.

This is a good point to repeat the issue of the throat sound. If 
you have a throat sound — even a little bit of a throat sound — it 
is physically impossible to do this gasp inhale. In order to do a 
gasp, whether to the belly or the chest, and irrespective of 
whether that is a gasp inhale (as here) or a gasp exhale (later in 
this chapter), any throat sound will slow down the inhale or 
exhale to the point that while it might be rapid, it is not a gasp.

Now at this point I have to add a caution which becomes more 
emphatic for the next section on the ‘percussive’ effect. This gasp 
inhale belly is a full breath. Many people try to accomplish a gasp 
by lessening the inhale, by making it only a partial inhale. It 
should be a full inhale.  If you do a gasp by making the full inhale 
shallower, then you are not doing it properly. The gasp inhale 
should be just as deep, just as full, as the slowly done belly only 
breath.  

3) ‘PERCUSSIVE EFFECT’ GOES TO THE PELVIS

Now to the really advanced part. It can take a long time to get 
to this point. Think of this as the final step and, in fact, the goal. 
When you reach this point you have mastered this technique. 



102 Reichian technique, Part One     

I call this a “percussive effect.” I call it that because of both 
the way it feels and the way it happens. Since diaphragmatic 
breathing starts at the top of the belly, when the diaphragm 
suddenly contracts (as in the gasp inhale) it sends a wave of 
pressure from the ribs downward toward the pelvis. This happens 
very quickly (less than 1/4 of a second) but it is real. So when 
you are able to (1) do the gasp properly, and (2) you are able to 
let the belly fully expand, then you get a kind of hit or strike to 
the pelvic area. You can begin to imagine the effects this exercise 
will have on your sexual experience.

Don’t be concerned if you can not feel this strike to the pelvis. 
It takes considerable time to trust your body enough to let go of 
all the muscle tension in the abdomen so that the pressure wave 
can get down to the pelvis. Treat it as your goal. The first time or 
two it occurs, it will feel strange; but you will get used to it and it 
produces some strong effects.

GASP INHALE CHEST 

It is evident that you can not do a gasp inhale chest before you 
can do the chest only breathing. So get that going fully before 
you try this exercise.

As with the gasp inhale belly, the total time for the gasp is 
about 1/4 of a second. Recall the following about this: (1) it is 
done only with the muscles between the ribs, there is no use of 
the accessory muscles of respiration; (2) it does not make any use 
of the diaphragm (the abdomen does not tense or get pulled in).

In terms of the muscles, this is not a hard exercise. It terms of 
being able to do it right, it is difficult. Even people who have 
learned to do chest only breathing properly, when they start this 
exercise tend to revert to tensing the belly at the beginning of the 
breath.

To be done after you have mastered the chest only
breathing

Stop when you find that you are tensing the abdomen. The 
muscles between the ribs are small and tire easily.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  103
The muscles between the ribs are small and thus can tire 

easily. That fact tends to cause even people who can do this 
exercise to soon revert and start tensing the abdomen or pulling 
the abdomen in just before or at the same time as the gasp inhale 
chest. When you find that you are doing that, stop the exercise; 
you have done as much as you can of this exercise in this session.

After the gasp inhale, the exhale is at a normal speed with the 
normal ‘ah’ sound.

GASP EXHALE BELLY 

Above I discussed gasp inhale belly, now I talk about gasp 
exhale belly.

There are two variants of this exercise: (a) in one you do a 
normal inhale to the belly and then a gasp exhale, (b) in the other 
you do two gasps, one gasp inhale to the belly and then a gasp 
exhale from the belly. The latter exercise with a gasp inhale and 
gasp exhale is a very advanced exercise and should not be used 
until the gasp inhale belly and then the gasp exhale belly are 
individually both fully learned.

As you might expect, the chest should not move on either of 
the two variants. One difference here from the usual breathing is 
that there is no ‘ah’ sound to start the exhale. Use of the ‘ah’ 
sound slows down the exhale so that it is no longer a gasp. It is a 
bit unusual in English to talk about a gasp exhale. Normally we 
associate the gasp only with an inhale. But there is no reason to 
use a different word. Like the gasp inhale, the whole exhale takes 
only about 1/4 of a second. 

With two variants, which do you start with? You start with the 
normal inhale to the belly only and then the gasp exhale. When 
you have fully mastered that, then you can proceed to the more 
difficult gasp inhale followed by the gasp exhale. 

Two variants of this exercise:
1. normal inhale; gasp exhale
2. gasp inhale; gasp exhale

To be done after mastering the gasp inhale belly
NO ‘AH’ SOUND ON THE EXHALE!!!



104 Reichian technique, Part One     

Further, if you do the gasp inhale and gasp exhale there is the 
danger that the breathing might become too rapid. I don’t want 
that. Normal breathing is about 12 breaths per minute. That is a 
good speed. Do a gasp inhale, then a gasp exhale, then pause for a 
few seconds before you start the next round. 

Remember, there is no ‘ah’ sound with this exercise. Trivial as 
it may seem, this is actually really important. If you start the 
exhale with the normal ‘ah’ sound it is then impossible to do a 
gasp on the exhale. Just by making the sound you have already 
slowed down the exhale enough that it is not a gasp. 

There is  another issue I  wil l  mention here only for 
informational purposes. The gasp should be not only without the 
‘ah’ sound, but also without any throat sound. By the time you 
get to this point in your work, you may well have already 
eliminated the throat sound, but if not the discussion of how to 
work on that issue is in the next chapter.

GASP EXHALE CHEST 

As above I had gasp exhale belly, now I have gasp exhale 
chest. Again there are the two variants: (1) normal inhale chest 
followed by gasp exhale chest, and (2) gasp inhale chest then 
gasp exhale chest. Also as before get the two individual exercises 
of gasp inhale only and gasp exhale only both fully mastered 
before you try putting them together.

This exercise is more difficult than the belly gasp exercises. 
The diaphragm is a thin muscle and can move quickly. The chest, 
on the other hand, requires the contraction of all the muscles 
between the ribs to produce either the gasp inhale or the gasp 
exhale.

None the less, the speed of the gasp for the chest is just as 
short as the gasp for the belly, about 1/4 of a second. 

Two variants of this exercise:
1. normal inhale; gasp exhale
2. gasp inhale; gasp exhale

To be done only after mastering the gasp inhale chest.
NO ‘AH’ SOUND ON THE EXHALE!!!



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  105
I also want to add here the same cautions I discussed above for 

the gasp exhale belly. Don’t let this exercise drive you into faster 
breathing, it is not panting, it is still about 12 breaths a minute. So 
even through each exhale (or each inhale and exhale) is rapid, the 
overall breathing rate does not change.

Next, recall that the chest gasp should not, in any way, involve 
the belly. You can use the same techniques I have mentioned 
previously of using your hands to insure that you have isolated 
the chest  from the belly and that each can be invoked 
independent of the other.

CRY BREATHING 

During crying, if it is deep, the breath cycle naturally changes 
markedly. Instead of a single continuous inhale, the inhale is 
broken up into a series of short bursts. To give you a rough idea, 
the inhale (to the belly then the chest) is made up of six to eight 
mini inhales. 

In this breathing method I are not concerned with whether the 
inhale is to the belly, the chest, or both. That does not, however, 
sanction paradoxical breathing. If both the belly and the chest are 
used then either it is first belly then chest or both together; it is 
never chest then belly.

This exercise mainly serves the purpose of eliciting character 
issues related to feeling sorry for yourself (self-pity). In some 
people just doing this type of breathing will bring on tears. If that 
is the case, just let the crying develop on its own. Don’t try to 
deepen it, extend it, or control it in any way. Just to be technical 

Many short inhales go into making one complete inhale.
An error is to do paradoxical breathing (chest then belly).

NEVER CRY WITHOUT SOUND. IF YOU START 
CRYING MAKE SURE YOU ADD LARGE SOUND TO 
IT.

After the exercise do a verbal body report



106 Reichian technique, Part One     

about it, crying as such is not an emotion; it is an expression or 
manifestation of the emotion of self-pity.

There is, however, one rule about crying. Crying should never 
be soundless. Even if you only leak tears, always, always put 
sound to the crying. Never allow yourself in this work to cry 
quietly. If no sound seems to be appropriate, if no sound seems 
quite right or natural, then impose some sound on the crying. The 
appropriate sounds will come in due time.

Like all the exercises, don’t overdo it. The deeper crying 
becomes, the more it tends to become weeping. Despite what you 
might have read in Reich or Lowen, weeping is not a goal of the 
therapy. It is, rather obviously, not the case that all people have 
such level of self-pity that they have occasion or need to weep.

If the crying becomes too strong for you then step in and stop 
it. Crying can be controlled. Think of the common technique we 
use with children when we want them to stop crying. We say “let 
me see a smile.” The act of smiling is incompatible with crying 
that is why putting on a smile stops the crying. So if there is 
crying, let it develop to the point that it makes you uncomfortable 
or its seems to be getting artificial (that is you are putting on an 
act of crying) and then step in and stop it.

A good addition is that after a cry you lie flat on the bed and 
sense your body. Report your sensations out loud (see: POST 
EXERCISE SENSING AND FEELING on page 21). When you 
have finished sensing your body (no set time limit) then you can 
stop for the day or return to the exercises. 

In this work, never cry soundlessly. Always add 
sound to any crying irrespective of its intensity.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  107

SEE-SAW BREATHING 

Now we reach an even more difficult breathing technique. 
Here inhale is to the chest and exhale is to the belly. Think 

about that for a moment. On your first inhale your chest rises and 
your belly is relaxed. When you exhale your chest collapses and 
your belly balloons out. Then when you inhale again your belly 
collapses and your chest rises. It is as though you were passing 
the same air between your chest and your belly. 

How is that possible? Trust me. It can be done. I have done 
this in my own work and have trained many others to do it. It is 
simply not easy to do or to maintain speed and rhythm. 

This is the only breathing technique which is fast in the sense 
that instead of about 12 breaths per minute you are doing 20 to 25 
breaths per minute. Don’t try to count or time yourself; the issue 
is that this is rapid deep breathing as opposed to the normal-speed 
deep breathing.

You can use the normal ‘ah’ sound to start the exhale or you 
can drop the sound. Both are appropriate.

This breathing is, without question, a more advanced exercise. 
Both for self-improvement reasons and medical reasons don’t do 
this exercise until you have shown that your body can deal with 

This is an advanced exercise in that you should have
already mastered the chest only and the belly only
breathing.

Here you see-saw between the chest and the belly:
1. on the inhale the chest expands and the belly

collapses
2. on the exhale the chest collapses and the belly

expands
3. the breathing is rapid
4. you can drop the ‘ah’ sound 

Don’t do this exercise if you can’t tolerate the
hyperventilation

The breath should be full. Don’t let your breathing
become shallow.



108 Reichian technique, Part One     

the blowing off of the carbon dioxide (the hyperventilation that I 
discussed at the beginning of the book) without problem. 

Hyperventilation results in a meaningful reduction in oxygen 
to the brain. That is one reason it produces dizziness and tingling. 
If, in doing this exercise, you experience significant dizziness or 
disorientation, simply stop the exercise. You have gone as far as 
is appropriate for your body. In any event, this exercise is done 
for only a few minutes; perhaps three to five, certainly ten is too 
long. 

This is a good point to remind you about the rare but possible 
medical complications of rapid deep breathing (see: MEDICAL 
NOTE on page 61).

It is a frequent error in doing this exercise that while the 
breathing is rapid, it is also shallow. There is minimal expansion 
of the belly and minimal expansion of the chest. That is incorrect. 
The chest expansion and the belly expansion should be just as 
full as if you were doing normal slow breathing.

In practicing this exercise a good technique is to start it with 
comparatively slow breathing just to get the feel of the body and 
of the rhythm. When you are able for several minutes to do the 
see-saw breathing slowly, then you can start to speed it up. The 
standard is the full expansion rather than the speed. Better not too 
fast then to have the breathing become shallow.

OTHER SOUNDS 

Throughout I have emphasized that the exhale starts with a 
soft, short, non-articulated, non-guttural ‘ah’ sound. Hopefully 
by this time you have that well mastered.  

Now I will introduce you to other sounds that can be used. 
While I am introducing these sounds near the end of Part One of 

Shout exhale
Moan exhale
Groan exhale
Growl exhale
Words exhale



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  109
the book that does not mean that none of these sounds can be 
used earlier in your work. It is just that it is generally better to 
have the ‘ah’ sound well mastered and the breathing going fairly 
well before you proceed to other sounds. Still that is just a rule of 
thumb, it is not any sort of requirement or warning. 

Your objective here is to try to put feeling into each sound. 
Psychologists divide feelings into two classes: pleasurable and 
unpleasurable. 

As you have freed up your chest you have probably noticed 
that you can now experience far more pleasure than you could 
before you started. If you haven’t noticed that, stop here and give 
yourself some time – several weeks – to become aware of the 
change in your ability to enjoy life. Notice that you are less “up 
tight” than you used to be; you have less need of rigid rules to 
govern your life; you are more flexible and spontaneous.

That’s nice. Pleasure is always desirable. But mainly what 
holds us back in life is our unwillingness to deal with unpleasure. 
It would be nice if we could simply skip the unpleasure part. We 
can’t. The unwillingness to deal with unpleasurable feelings acts 
much like a small room where every turn leads into a wall. The 
door out of that room is the door to the hallway of unpleasure. It 
is not fun but it is necessary if you are to get out into the sunlight 
of a full life.

In all cases of these new sounds of therapy, examples are 
present on the Sounds of Reichian audio.

MOAN EXHALE

The moan and the next one, the groan, are done slightly 
differently from all the other sounds. One difference is that with 
these sounds you roll your head from side to side as you make the 
sound. The second difference is that these sounds are drawn out 
for almost the full exhale. They don’t just start the exhale as did 
the ‘ah’ sound.

The issue here is how does one, in words, describe a moan? It 
is one of those things that we all know, but putting it into words 
is not easy, so I consulted a dictionary. 

Well, the dictionary says a moan is a sound of pain or grief. I 
suppose that is good enough for a dictionary; but not good 



110 Reichian technique, Part One     

enough here. Grief depends on the culture. In some cultures grief 
is expressed by a wail rather than a moan. But pain, that seems to 
be the same across cultures. While we think of pain in terms of 
body pain, there is also existential  pain. 

OK, so what is existential pain? It is the pain we feel from 
adversity in life. It is what we talk of  “as a painful experience.” 

Unfortunately we tend to treat personal pain in silence. While 
I want you to think existential pain, the sound is the type you 
make in mild but continuous physical pain. 

It usually uses the ‘oh’ sound rather than the ‘ah’ sound and 
often changes into almost a hum. 

While this book is a discussion of technique — a method for 
you to treat and hopefully correct your own character problems 
— I would add here just one sentence for contemplation: 
Socrates said that “an unexamined life is not worth living;” I 
would add that a life without pain is a life unlived.

GROAN EXHALE

OK, so what is the difference between a moan and a groan? 
The dictionary defines a groan as a deep moan. Thanks guys, that 
helps.

The groan sound I have in mind is louder and stronger than a 
moan. It is the sound you might make if there were pain 
throughout your body and the pain is mildly strong and 
continuous.

Another difference between the moan and the groan is that 
while the moan often changes into almost a hum, the groan does 
not. Just the opposite. The groan tends to be shorter than a moan 
and is repeated several times during the exhale. Thus while it is 
easy to moan in one continuous sound, the groan tends to be 
louder and shorter such that a single exhale produces several 
groan attempts. 

Again the sound is ‘oh’ rather then ‘ah’ and the head is rolled 
from side to side during the sound. The inhale is a normal full 
inhale.

SHOUT EXHALE



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  111
The shout is difficult to describe in words. First it uses “UH” 

rather than “AH.” 
Next, a shout is not a scream. A scream is long and piercing. A 

shout is short and emphatic. 
Also a shout is not a yell. Yelling is only loud and, since it 

involves whole words rather than just a short sharp sound, a shout 
must involve open and closing the throat (that is the voice box).

Next, in order to do a shout you have to have good motion in 
the chest. A shout comes from sudden rapid contraction of the 
chest rather than from the diaphragm. 

Next, a shout can be accomplished only if the throat is open. A 
proper shout can not have any sense of the guttural. 

There is a curious result of a good open-throated shout. I can’t 
explain why it happens, but it always does. If there is any metal 
in the room, then it will ring with the shout. I have heard it 
produced by metal space heaters, by over-head fans, and by air 
conditioning grills.

Finally, the shout sound starts the exhale but the rest of the 
exhale is normal, it is not faster or more forced. That is to say the 
exhale starts with a loud short shout sound but then continues on 
as a normal exhale.

For all that description you can get a good idea of what a shout 
should be like and the trouble that people have with it by 
checking the audio that accompanies this book.

I have resisted the impulse throughout this book to tell you 
patient stories, but here I really must just to give you an idea of 
why things happen and why they change with this work.

The patient was a female who from about the age of seven to 
about the age of nine was subject to “genital fingering” by a step- 
brother. It took her two years to tell her mother about it. When 
she came to therapy and tried this exercise, her shout was mild, to 
say the most for it. She had built into her character (not 
deliberately, that’s just the way character works) that she could 
not protest in life. She had to accept things she did not like and 
consequently walk through life angry all the time. It took time, 
but she learned to shout; she learned to stand up for herself 
without having to wait for anger to give her permission.

GROWL EXHALE



112 Reichian technique, Part One     

The best description I can give of this is that it sounds rather 
like a motor boat. Your vocal cords are relaxed and flapping in 
the wind of the exhale. The growl is deep and throaty. A 
reasonably good example of the growl is on the audio.

It is important that you not close your mouth while making 
this exhale sound. Keep your mouth well open as shown earlier in 
the top panel of Figure 13 on page 66. 

Don’t try to get this one until you have already mastered the 
normal breathing with the ‘ah’ sound and the shout sound. At the 
end of Part One of this book I will give you a guide for the 
sequence of steps to get the breathing correct.

The  g rowl  s ound ,  desp i t e  i t s  eve ry -day  name ,  i s  
extraordinarily hard to produce. It requires a truly open throat to 
make this sound. Further and importantly, this sound will 
produce major effects in your body (like tingling, throbbing, 
dizziness, and others). Until you have become accustomed to the 
appearance of strange body experiences, it is very unwise to do 
this exercise.

The growl is continuous for most of the exhale or as long as 
you can to extend it. If you find that your throat is closed and you 
can not get this one, don’t force it. Stop during this session and 
try it again at the next session. 

While it sounds very simple to do a growl sound, in fact it is 
not. It requires a completely open throat in order to make this 
sound. 

WORDS EXHALE

This is a powerful exercise, but the exact words to use vary 
with the person.

Here you start the exhale with one word or a string of words. 
Some examples: ‘please’, ‘no I won’t’, ‘help me’, ‘go away’, 
‘why’, ‘I need you’, ‘why me’, ‘I’m not bad’ etc. With any word 
or phrase, attempt to add some feeling tone to it. The word ‘why’ 
can be said as a normal word in a sentence or it can be said with 
an element of self-pity or sadness or longing or protest etc. 
Moreover the feeling tone does not have to stay the same any 
more than the word needs to stay the same.



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  113
Start with any word or phrase. If it seems that you can not get 

any feeling tied to it, then try a different word or phrase. Invent 
your own. Whatever seems to mean something to you 
emotionally. Stay with the word or phrase only as long as it 
seems to be meaningful. Then stop and return to normal 
breathing or change to some other word or phrase. 

If you do this exercise mechanically, that is just saying some 
word or phrase with no feeling tied to it, it not only will not 
accomplish its purpose, it will do the opposite. You will have, in 
effect, practiced this exercise in a way that produces no results. 
That only makes it easier the next time to be mechanical.

Like so many of the exercises in both Part One and Part Two 
of this book, this exercise seems trivial. And it can be if that is 
how you approach it. But if you honestly try to find the right 
word or phrase and you honestly attempt to attach some feeling 
to the word or phrase, then you will find the power of this 
seemingly benign exercise.

BOGEYMEN

Have you ever wondered why there are no bogey women? I 
have but I have no answer (at least none that I am willing to print, 
point of personal privacy).

When you were young you probably had the same fears that 
almost every child has: alligators or snakes under the bed, 
someone hiding in the closet, someone sneaking in through the 
window, the fear that one or both of your parents would not be 
there the next morning when you woke up. And likely you 
learned to call that fear: the bogeyman. And each night you were 
reassured that there was no bogeyman and that in any event your 
parents would protect you.

Guess what? There are bogeymen. They are, however, not out 
there; they are in here. There is a bogeyman inside you. Well, to 
tell you the truth, actually there are two of them. 

The first bogeyman hides under a number of names. It goes by 
the name of the superego, the parental introject, the “should” 
system. It makes you do things you don’t want to do and prevents 
you from doing things you want to do. It converts life from a 
process, a continuous experience, into a habit. 

That superego bogeyman is not a bad thing, it has to be there 
or we could not live in a social group. It is only that that 
bogeyman keeps growing and growing and growing until there is 
no room left for joyous spontaneous living. You know all this, 
you just haven’t put it into specific words.

Why do we “take” a vacation? Why do we “plan a party?” 
Why do we “schedule our children’s time?” In high school or 
college you just partied; you did not plan a party. As children (if 
you were old enough) you just played, you did not schedule play 
time. Couldn’t we just vacation rather than take a vacation? 

People are time-waiting animals. We wait to graduate from 
grammar school, then we wait to graduate from middle school, 
then we wait to graduate from high school, then we wait to 
graduate from college, then we wait to get married, then we wait 
to have children, then we wait for the children to grow up, then 
we wait to retire, then we wait to die. Life comes down to waiting 
for death. 



Chapter 5, Breathing exercises                  115

STUPID.

If you are serious about this work, that parental-introject-
superego-should is going to get very upset. Expect it. 

But, as bad as that first bogeyman is, as anti-life-enjoyment as 
it is, it is not the worst of our internal anti-heroes. The worst, the 
most vicious, the most destructive and the biggest bogeyman of 
all is just one word: 

CONTROL!

Famously, the author Henry David Thoreau wrote: “the mass 
of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” All too true. And all too 
unnecessary. The biggest hurdle you will face and one that you 
will face right unto the end of this work, through both parts of the 
book and all the exercises, is the refusal to let go of control. It is 
not that control is wrong – it is certainly not inappropriate to 
control what you say or watch where you’re going – it is that the 
mass of men can not dismiss control when it is not needed. 
Control becomes so pervasive, so pernicious, that we come to 
even control our control.

Has there ever lived a parent who has not said to his (her) 
child “control yourself” and/or “you’ve got to learn self-
control?” Do you remember those stern disapproving looks or 
those reprimands when you were simply being silly, simply 
having fun, simply being spontaneous? The demand for control 
has been burned into your soul. It is there eating at you, feeding 
on itself, making sure that even spontaneity has to be planed. But, 
especially, making sure that your body, your reactions and your 
emotions are controlled. 

Like other character attitudes, control is manifested in the 
body. I have had patients who finally came to identify their point 
or area of control. Variously that place has been in the neck, the 
upper chest, the whole chest, the upper back, the tip of the 
scapula bone (the wing bone), the lower back and the legs.

The need of control is a lack of trust in yourself, your abilities 
and your nature. It is a paradox of humans that the more we 



116 Reichian technique, Part One     

attempt to control our lives, the more the need to control comes to 
dominate our personality. Control in this sense feeds on itself. 

An unintended result of the need to control is that all of life 
becomes a performance. We do not live life, we are lived by life. 
We come to be not what we would enjoy being, but rather what 
we think others want us to be. 

But control is not in itself a bad thing; it is necessary if we are 
to live in society. 

Self-control is crucial to empathy. It is hard to consider some-
one else’s emotional state if all you can do is think about 
yourself. Of course, when you empathize, you do not switch 
off your feelings, since having an appropriate emotional 
response to the other person’s feelings is empathy, but you do 
need self-control to set aside your current (self-centered) goal 
in order to attend to someone else.19

It is when control changes to rigidity that it becomes anti-life; 
when control changes from self-control to self-control that life 
become endurance rather than enjoyment.

One of the things that will happen to you I can say with 
confidence is that as you get deeper into this work you will get 
unplanned (and if you allow it, uncontrolled) jerking and 
twitching in your body20. You can treat the jerking and twitching 
as fun, as a wonderful release, or you can be afraid of it. Your 
choice.

But even if you come to accept and enjoy the twitching, there 
will still be a big layer of control-demand present. In a little while 
I will present some advanced breathing exercises that strike to the 
very essence of control. There will be some of you who can 
through these exercises allow control to be done away with; some 
of you who will come to trust the “wisdom of the body.” But, 
unfortunately, all too many of you will demand performance of 
yourself in even those exercises and will control yourself through 
them. You are the time binders; you are the ones who say: I will

be better when I am through with this work. After I have finished, 
then I can start to get more out of life. But there is no finish to 
improvement, only death ends that. You can continue to be the 
living dead or you can choose life as its own goal. I can’t control 
that, you can.

STOPPING POINT!!!

You have been working on your character (flaws) with the 
exercises I have presented up to this point. But there are issues I 
have mentioned but I have not given you the correction for them. 

Recall: (1) the two chest shapes and (2) the accessory muscles 
of respiration. You may well have already taken care of the held-
high and the held-low chests by using the push breathing for the 
held-high chest and the belly-out-breath-chest-only for the held-
low chest. If that is the case then part of Chapter 6 is not 
necessary for you. You have already corrected the situation.

But there may still be the issue of using those accessory 
muscles of respiration to move your chest. Remember way back 
when I spoke about using a tape measure or a string to see that 
your chest is expanding? Try that again now. You should be 
getting one inch to an inch and a half expansion on the tape 
measure around your chest. If you are not getting that, if there is 
either no expansion or just barely some expansion, then go to 
Chapters 6 and 7 to find out how to correct that situation.

should be. Sorry about that, but I did want to cover all the issues 
before you start on a directed course of action to get your 
breathing to be where it should be.

Need I say it again? NEVER NEVER PUSH. BETTER 
TOO SLOWLY THAN TOO FAST. If your reaction to the 
breath work is too strong, stop the breath session. Come back to it 
a few days or a week later. This is not a contest and it is not a test 
of determination and it is not a test of will power. I usually 
illustrate this issue with the following.

Suppose you have not exercised in years. You go into a health 
club and you immediate try to bench press two hundred pounds. 
What is likely to happen? You are likely to break bones, or tear 
muscles, or tear ligaments. That is, you are likely to injure. Now 
suppose that you go in and you bench press 20 pounds. Then over 
the next year or two you slowly work up to heavier and heavier 
weights. Now you can do it and the result will be further strength, 
not injury. The rule throughout both parts of this book is: 
ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY.

DEALING WITH CHEST SHAPES 

For our purposes here in freeing the diaphragm and the chest I 
have broken it up into two categories: chest held high and chest 
held low. 

As I discussed before: “don’t stress beyond endurance”; don’t 
try to be a hero; don’t try to be the fastest changer on the block; 
don’t think that you will not change unless you push to your 
limit; don’t overdo it. Anything that is present and arises in a 
session will still be there to arise in another session without your 
pushing it. Let things happen to a degree that seems reasonable 
for you in any given session and then stop. Some people, by 
reason of where they start, proceed with extreme rapidity and 
others with immense slowness. You are who you are, accept that 
and work within those limitations.

I     PREPARATION

1. Work first on the belly-chest sequence of breathing. If 
you can not use your chest because it is frozen in the chronic 



Chapter 6, Learning to breathe properly          121
inhale position, I will get to that presently. Likewise if you can 
not use you belly, I will get to that presently also. Just do your 
best to make a habit of the belly-chest sequence, both inhale and 
exhale.

2. Next work on the sound. Remember this is not a contest, 
there is no failure, just something not yet mastered. If you are 
making some sound other than ‘ah’ or if you are closing your 
throat (articulated or guttural), this can be corrected later.

3. Now attempt to get rid of any pause between the inhale 
and the exhale. If you need to think of the process as first and 
inhale and then an exhale, that is OK for the present. Later you 
will get the hang of  rhythmic breathing.

4. Become accustomed to the effects of reduced carbon 
dioxide (hyperventilation) until the tingling or the spasm or the 
other symptoms do not frighten you. I say again this is not a 
contest and ‘look how quickly I can learn to do it’ is only another 
way to say ‘look how I can endure unpleasantness without 
stopping (i.e. masochism).’ You want to learn to accept and even 
find pleasure in the effects of hyperventilation so if, in a given 
session, it gets too strong then simply stop the session for awhile 
or even stop for the day and pick up later or the next time.

I would also remind you of MEDICAL NOTE on page 61
concerning hyperventilation.

II   IF YOU CAN NOT USE THE DIAPHRAGM, THEN

1.   Use the breathe belly only exercise (page 85). Do not try 
the gasp inhale belly, that is too advanced. Keep working on this 
exercise until you are not able to make any more progress. Some 
people have very tight abdominal muscles (recall the difference 
between tonic muscles and toned muscles) and thus their ability 
to use the diaphragm will be limited. In Chapter five I partially 
explained the roll the pelvis exercise (page 95). The roll the 
pelvis exercise is the big one for loosening the abdomen. You 
will not do any harm to this work if you skip to ROLL THE 
PELVIS on page 281, learn the proper way to do the exercise; 
and spend as many months as needed with the roll the pelvis 
exercise to loosen the abdomen. If you are working with a helper, 
the use of pressure by the helper is explained at  THE 



122 Reichian technique, Part One     

DIAPHRAGM on page 157. However, you can also just accept 
your limitations until you get to the abdominal section in Part 
Two of the book where the roll the pelvis exercise is presented as 
a major exercise.

2.   When you have made as much progress as you can on 
breathing only into the abdomen, then try the gasp inhale belly 
exercise (page 99) to see that you really have control of this 
muscle. Keep in mind that the chest should not move at all in the 
belly only or gasp belly only exercises. The idea of using this 
exercise at this time is only to test how well you have freed the 
diaphragm. Later you will actually use this exercise as part of 
your routine.

III    IF YOUR CHEST IS HELD IN CHRONIC 
EXHALE (CHEST DOWN), THEN

The exercises to use for this condition are the side bend 
(below) and the extend belly breathe chest only (page 91). If you 
are working with a helper then you can also get help on the held-
down chest there by the helper preventing you from breathing 
into the belly, thus forcing chest breathing (page 159). Note that 
this assumes that you have already learned the belly only 
breathing. 

Bringing the chest up will not happen quickly. Don’t get 
discouraged. Keep in mind that your objective is to free the chest 
so that you can breathe into it using the muscles between the ribs. 
Your chest shape will change in time but you will not get the 
barrel shape. Given your body build it will still remain long and 
thin, but it will be not quite as linear as it used to be.  

SIDE BEND 

For the person with the chest held in chronic exhale and for
the person who has trouble getting the chest to expand in
the inhale

This exercise is done standing up.



Chapter 6, Learning to breathe properly          123
This exercise is used by people who can not get the chest to 

rise because it is held down. The reason for the use of the 
exercise is a little more difficult to explain, so bear with me.

Recall that I spoke of the long thin chest that can not move up 
and the barrel chest that is already up and can not get down. 
Generally, whatever your chest shape you were born that way. 
Some people have long thin bodies like many rock stars and other 
people have large barrel chests like weight lifters or opera 
singers. You are not going to change your basic body shape; what 
both types need, however, is to be able to have the chest move 
with the breath. 

For the long thin type the issue usually is getting the chest to 
expand and rise with the inhale. For the barrel type the issue 
usually is getting the chest to fall after the exhale. What one seeks 
is to be in a state of flexibility, of life, of change where the chest 
moves with each breath.

Like all human attributes, the long thin chest to the barrel 
chest is really a continuous variation with the long thin chest and 
the barrel chest being the extremes. With the barrel chest being in 
a state of chronic inhale, this exercise is not applicable. 

This exercise is for the person with a chest that is round but 
not held up and for the person with the chest down in chronic 
exhale. There are two common reasons why these people can not 
get their chest to expand and rise with the inhale. The first reason 
is that he or she can not use the muscle between the ribs and thus 
attempts to get the chest to rise by using the accessory muscles of 
respiration. But there is another reason for difficulty. That reason 
is that the chest is being held down, prevented from rising, by 
other muscles. These muscles are at the side of the abdomen.21

These are the abdominal oblique muscles. The technique for 
relaxing the abdominal obliques is shown in Figure 33 and Figure 
34 on page 124. Note in Figure 33 that our model is standing 
straight with the arm against the head and in Figure 34 that 
bending to the side does not change that, the model is straight not 
bending forward.

21.There is also a muscle in the back which can prevent the chest 
from rising. That muscle is ignored in this presentation.



124 Reichian technique, Part One     

You may note that this technique is quite close to a yoga 
posture except that there is, as I will explain, movement here in 
contrast to the steady holding of a yoga posture.

Figure 33

Figure 34



Chapter 6, Learning to breathe properly          125
The following photos (Figure 35) show the error of either the 

arm not being close to the head or bending forward.
 

Figure 35

On the inhale stand with the arm straight over the head and 
bent as shown in the Figure 33. Try to breathe belly then chest. 
During the exhale reach downward, with the straight arm toward 
the floor and the bent arm reaching further to the side (as though 
your arm were pushing your head to the side). That is, the pulling 
on the abdominal oblique muscles is accomplished both by the 
reaching downward and the reaching across the head. 

There are two minor issues here. One is that the main focus of 
your motion is the arm that is reaching downward at your side. 
Think of this as though you were actually trying to bend so far to 
the side that your down arm could touch the floor. It can’t, of 
course, but think of reaching downward as though your down 
arm were actually going to touch the floor.

The other issue is that this is not a single static movement. 
That is, you don’t just reach and then hold it for the whole exhale. 
Rather you kind of bounce to the side, each time trying to touch 
the floor. But keep in mind as you do this not to bend forward as 
the model is doing in Figure 35.



126 Reichian technique, Part One     

After each exhale is finished, you return to the upright stance 
to do the inhale.

Do this about six times with one arm over the head and then 
switch to the other arm over the head. The exercise should go on 
for about five minutes.

IV   IF YOUR CHEST IS HELD IN CHRONIC INHALE 
(CHEST UP), THEN

The exercise to use to get the chest down is the push breathing 
(page 94). Please do it exactly as I have described with the rolling 
of the pelvis and the belly held out during the whole forced 
exhale. 

You may have difficulty with this exercise if your accessory 
muscles of respiration are chronically tight. This issue is 
discussed in the next chapter.

If you are working with a helper, the helper can help greatly 
with this issue by the use of pressure. There are several 
references to this in Chapter nine: (1) diaphragm and chest 
pressure at pages 158 and 15922, (2) work on some of the 
accessory muscles and in particular the pectorals (page 160) and 
the trapezius (page 171). 

22.Unfortunately my model posing lacks proper shots on chest pres-
sure. Figure 55 on page 159, right, only shows pressure on the 
lower ribs. In fact to help push the chest down, the helper should 
use the downward pressure on the ribs over the whole of the chest 
and especially on the sternum (breast bone). For female workers, 
the helper should avoid pressure on breast tissue. Pressure on 
breast tissue is painful and non-productive. There is no breast tis-
sue over the sternum so pressure here (angled toward the feet and 
the bed) can be used. For the middle ribs, the helper can move up 
the chest from below so that the breast tissue is moved up and is 
not under the hands. 

Pressure on the chest is often uncomfortable, but rarely painful. The 
pressure should be even and slowly applied. The ribs are attached 
to the sternum by cartilage so it flexes easily. However, as we age 
the cartilage becomes bone. It is possible to fracture the cartilage 
or, in older workers, the bone. In 35 years of doing this work, that 
has happened three times. If there is a fracture, it heals, untreated, 
in six weeks.



Chapter 6, Learning to breathe properly          127

V   CHEST MOBILE

Now, if you have the diaphragm moving properly and the 
chest breathing is with the rib muscles, you are ready for more 
advanced exercises.

have a lot more flexibility in life and your control needs have 
been considerably reduced. You are ready for the final steps. 
Finish the process by using the other exercises including, now, 
the advanced exercises and all of the body work exercises in Part 
Two of this book.

two wings of the pelvis (about the place where the bladder is) as 
shown in Figure 36. 

Having done that, now draw in as large a breath as you can 
into the chest. You should feel NO movement below either hand; 
that is, your belly should not collapse or tighten. If you can not do 
this – if you find the belly contracting or the belly tensing – then 
you are using the diaphragm to push the chest up. 

Figure 36

  
CHECKING THE MUSCLES IN THE FRONT OF THE 
CHEST

To see if the muscle in the front of the chest is being used 
during the inhale, start at the complete exhale state. Either pinch 
the muscle at your armpit (the pectoral), see the left panel in 
Figure 37 on page 131 or press into the muscle (the right panel). 
Then do a complete inhale including the chest. If the muscle 
tenses (the increase in tension is very easy to feel) during the 
inhale, then it is being used to raise the chest (incorrect) instead 
of the chest expanding (correct).

THE MUSCLES IN THE FRONT OF THE NECK

There is one major muscle in the front of the neck. This 
muscle is the sternocleidomastoid muscle. When you are lying 
down, this muscle should not be tight, it should be soft. If you 



Chapter 7, Accessory muscles of respiration     131
know this muscle, you can just pinch it even before a breath to 
see if it is tense. 

Figure 37

If you are not familiar with this muscle, here is how to find it. 
First place your index finger in about the middle of the side of 
your neck (Figure 38, left). Now, with the finger curved in and 
down, move your had toward the front until you feel it bump up

Figure 38

against some resistance to the forward motion (Figure 38, right). 
If, in your case, this muscle is very relaxed before an inhale, the 
resistance to the forward movement is subtle.

Now that you have located the border of this muscle, you can 
change and pinch it between your thumb (at the front side of the 
neck) and your first finger (at the breast bone). What I mean by 
that is that the muscles lie from where your finger is to a point 
almost in the middle of your breast bone. While the photos above 
show the model laying down in working position to feel for the 



132 Reichian technique, Part One     

muscle, you should practice locating this muscle while you are 
here reading the book. It is much easier to locate this muscle 
when you are sitting up since it then has a postural function and is 
usually tighter than when you lay down. Once you get the feel for 
locating this muscle, it will be no trouble to do that while you are 
in the working position.

The left panel of Figure 39 has some arrows drawn on it to 
show you the middle and outside border of this muscle. 

Returning to the issue of whether this muscle is used in 
breathing, as before, start with a complete exhale. Now pinch the 
muscle. Next do a complete inhale including the chest. If this 
muscle tenses during the inhale it means that you are using it to 
raise the chest. It is easy to feel if it tenses during the inhale or 
stays relaxed (or is tense before the inhale even starts). 

There is one slight caveat here. If you are totally unable to 
breathe at all into the chest, then obviously this muscle is not 
going to change in its tension. If your chest is so stuck in an up 
(chronic inhale) position that you can not use it at all for 
breathing, then this is a false test. All testing for use of the 
accessory muscle of respiration assumes that you are able in 
some degree to breathe into the chest.

Another way to test whether you are using this muscle is to 
put pillows under your head so that your chin is forced onto your 
breastbone. You can also move next to a wall or bed board to 
force your chin onto your breastbone. Now do a complete breath 
into the belly and the chest. Is there any difference in your ability 
to breathe into the chest? If so, then you are using the muscles at 
the front of your neck to breathe into the chest.

Figure 39



Chapter 7, Accessory muscles of respiration     133
Above, on the left of Figure 39, the photo and the arrows show 

that in this model the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle is 
prominent even when he has not yet taken a breath to the chest.

THE MUSCLES ON THE SIDE OF THE NECK

Now we get to some muscles that are more difficult to test. It 
is not uncommon that these muscles are so tense at all times that 
the difference between tension after a complete exhale and 
increase of tension during a complete inhale is difficult to feel. 
You may have to try the complete exhale followed by the 
complete inhale (to the chest) several times before you get any 
impression of whether the tension does or does not increase.

As with the muscle at the front of the neck, we are not 
concerned here with the degree of tension present at the complete 
exhale point, we are concerned only with the change during the 
inhale.

I also would not be fair if I did not mention here another 
variable. Some people have long necks, some short. One can 
have a long neck with comparatively short muscles. That tends to 
result in a state of constant tension because the muscles are 
simply not able to relax given the muscle’s length compared to 
the neck length. Similarly, one can have long muscles with a 
short neck so the muscles tend to be relaxed most of the time.

To check the use of these muscles, first place your second 
finger against the middle of your clavicle. Press your finger down 
against the bone and backward toward the bed and then move it 
forward until you locate the border of the same SCM muscles 
that I talked of above (in the discussion of Figure 38 and Figure 
39). 

Now rotate your hand and arm so that your finger is pressing 
into the side of your neck and downward. This is shown in 
Figure 40 on page 134. Be aware that only a little bit of this 
muscle can be felt so it is important that you press deeply into 
and down in the neck right next to the previously located SCM 
muscle. For the purist, this is the scalenus anticus (anterior 
scalene) muscle.



134 Reichian technique, Part One     

Now do your deep breath (belly then chest) and see if this 
muscle tenses. You will find a discussion of the anatomy of the 
neck starting on page 164. 

It can be difficult to feel if this muscle tightens with the 
breath. This is especially the case if this muscle is very tense 
before the breath even begins. 

If this muscle in the front side of the neck tenses, it is so likely 
that the other muscles on the side of the neck also tense that there 
is no reason to test for them. If it does not tense, then we test the 
other muscles on the side of the neck.

Figure 40

Before you were pressing in and down as shown in Figure 40. 
Now move your arm so that you are only pressing inward and 
move your finger back about an inch so that your finger is about 
in the middle of the side of your neck. The arm position is shown 
in Figure 41 left and the finger pushing in is seen in Figure 41
right panel. Here you are testing the medial scalene muscle



Chapter 7, Accessory muscles of respiration     135
. 

Figure 41

Now, again, take a couple of deep breaths to the chest to feel if 
this muscle tightens. As before the tightening, if it occurs, can be 
subtle so take as many breaths as needed to allow you to feel if 
this muscle tightens. Keep in mind that you are breathing as 
deeply as you can into the chest. 

Finally you are going to test the third muscle at the side of the 
neck. Again you move your finger back Your finger will now be 
just in front of the muscle which is commonly called the shoulder 
muscle. Press straight into the neck and slightly down as shown 
in Figure 42. You are feeling the posterior scalene.

Figure 42

Now while pressing on that muscle, take your full breath. 
Again it may be difficult to feel if this muscle tenses during the 
chest part of the inhale, so take several breaths into the chest until 
you are sure that it either does or does not tense



136 Reichian technique, Part One     

THE MUSCLES IN THE BACK OF THE NECK

This muscle is the most difficult of all to feel, but it is also the 
one most frequently used. While there are two muscles back 
there, we are concerned with only one (the trapezius) but we will 
test it at two places.

First we test the shoulder muscle directly. Here you pinch the 
shoulder muscle between the thumb and the first finger. This can 
be painful. Press as hard as you can without too much pain since 
the pain alone can influence your breathing. Now take a full 
breath and see if you can feel any tensing of the muscle. Do it a 
few times to be sure. This is shown in Figure 43, left.

Figure 43

Finally we need to test the same muscle at the very back of the 
neck. Here you cup your hand and press your fingers into the 
back of your neck just to the side of the spine. This would be hard 
to see if I took a photo of the position with the model lying down, 
so I show you this in Figure 43, right, with the model standing. 
Your little finger should be slightly below the base of your skull. 
This will work for people with both short and long necks. Take a 
few full breaths and try to feel for any tensing. Then move your 
fingers a little bit to the edge of the back of your neck and feel 
again for any tensing. 

You can find drawings and discussion of the trapezius muscle 
starting on page 169

By now you know three things: (1) is the chest expanding or is 
it either just rising or not moving at all; (2) are you using your 
diaphragm to move the chest; (3) are you using the accessory 



Chapter 7, Accessory muscles of respiration     137
muscles of respiration. If you are using any of the accessory 
muscles then you will want to use the appropriate exercise below 
to correct the problem.

WORKING ON THE ACCESSORY MUSCLES OF 
RESPIRATION

ARMS OVER HEAD

This one is designed to work with the muscles at the top front 
of the chest (the pectorals). If they are chronically tense (more 
common in the chest held high position) then you need to get 
them to relax. This is best done with pressure. Use the pads of 
your four fingers to press into the muscle on the opposite side 
(Figure 44 on page 138, left). Press only as hard as you can 
tolerate without excessive pain. If you can hold this pressure for 
about 10 minutes (on each side), it should leave the muscles 
slightly sore for a day or two. You keep doing this session after 
session until the tension is minimal.

Once your pectoral muscles are relaxed then the issue is to not 
use these muscles during the inhale to the chest. This is easy to 
stop simply by placing your arms all the way over your head (not 
toward the ceiling, but toward the end of the bed, Figure 44 on 
page 138, right). Breathe with your arms in this position. This

(for the muscles at the side of the neck)

138 Reichian technique, Part One     

position of the arms prevents the pectoral muscles from having 
much effect on the breathing. 

Figure 44

HEAD TO CHEST

This one is designed to help with the problem of using the 
accessory muscles at the front of the neck and also slightly one of 
the three accessory muscles at the side of the neck.

Recall from the previous discussion that this can be done two 
ways. One is to use pillows under the head to force the chin onto 
the breast bone (Figure 39 on page 132, right). The other is to 
place your head against a wall or a bed board, again so that the 
chin is forced onto the breast bone.

In this head-flexed position, breathe chest only. The goal, in 
the end, is to be able to expand the chest just as much with the 
head flexed as with the head in the normal lying down position. 

While this head-flexed position takes care of the muscles in 
the front of the neck and has some effect on the muscles on the 
side of the neck, it still allows use of the muscles at the back of 
the neck and the muscle at the back part of the side of the neck.

SIDE HEAD POSTURE

We have looked at the muscles in the front of the neck and at 
the back of the neck, but we also have the group at the side of the 
neck. Here we have a bit of a problem.



Chapter 7, Accessory muscles of respiration     139
The head to chest exercise has had some effect on the use of 

the muscles at the side of the neck for inhaling. However, we 
have not really stopped their use, only made them less effective 
in producing an inhale by raising the chest.

In this exercise you bend your head to the side so that your ear 
is touching your shoulder (or as far as you can go). This does not 
stop the use of the muscles on the stretched side, but it does stop 
them on the bent side. Obviously then, you are going to breathe 
for a while (let’s say five minutes) with your head on one 
shoulder and then switch to the other shoulder. 

Since this exercise does not completely stop the use of the 
muscles on the side of the neck opposite to the bent side, how can 
you tell if you are using those muscles?

Surprisingly, there is a simple way. With, for example, your 
head against your left shoulder, place the first finger of your right 
hand in the middle of the side of your neck 

Pressure is not needed. If you are breathing properly with the 
muscles between the ribs you will feel a slight relaxation of the 
muscle when you inhale. If you are using these muscles, you will 
feel a slight tensing of the muscles, the more so as the inhale 
proceeds to the deepest degree.

.

Figure 45

Then the question is what do you do if you are using these 
muscles to breathe? The answer here is to use pressure on the 
muscle. Use the pads of your fingers (using the end gets the nail 
biting in and produces unnecessary and non-functional pain). 
Place your four fingers in the middle of the side of your neck 
with your little finger near your jaw and press in to the level of 



140 Reichian technique, Part One     

pain tolerance. Unfortunately, I don’t have a photograph of that 
so a description will have to do. If, as you are sitting reading this 
book, you place your right hand against your neck such that you 
little finger is against your jaw, then the pads of your four fingers 
will be against the neck and ready for the pressure. Hold that as 
long as you can while you breathe. It does not hurt the process to 
remove your fingers for a while and then return to the pressure. 
Do not use so much pressure that you can hold it only for a few 
breaths, that is too much pressure. Use as much pressure as you 
can tolerate but still continue your breathing. The longer you can 
do this, the better. 

This process will take quite a few sessions to have its effect. 
Obviously you would do the same on both sides. You can know 
you are doing it well if your muscles are a bit sore the day after 
you do your breathing work

HEAD OFF BED, BREATHE CHEST ONLY 

Now we can take care of the muscles both at the side of the 
neck and at the back of the neck. We will simply stop them from 
doing much work by the same kind of trick, in reverse, as we did 
for the muscles at the front of the neck.

Move to the head of the bed and keep going. Your legs are still 
bent in the normal working position, except now you are going to 
hang your head over the end of the bed. This is not a partial 
hanging where the bed crosses your neck. No, it is all the way. 
The end of the bed is where your shoulders are and, in fact, even 
that might be a little short. Keep moving toward the end of the 
bed until your head is just totally hanging down. See also Figure 
98 on page 231.



Chapter 7, Accessory muscles of respiration     141

Figure 46

Now breathe with the chest only. Go for the complete 
expansion, just as if your head were still on the bed. Dizziness 
and even slight nausea are not uncommon in this body position. 
Unless you have problems with your spine in the neck area, the 
dizziness and/or the nausea are unpleasant but otherwise 
harmless.  If you do have problems with your spine in the neck 
area, check with your chiropractic physician, osteopathic 
physician, or orthopedic specialist before you do this exercise.

For people who use the accessory muscles of respiration at the 
back of the neck (and this is the most common form of accessory 
muscle use) this exercise proves tiring very quickly. Go for as 
long as you can and stop. There is always the next time. If this 
exercise is difficult for you it only serves to show you how much 
you are using these muscles to raise the chest rather than the 
intercostal muscles to expand the chest.

ARMS OVER HEAD, HEAD OFF BED

This is an advanced form of the “head off the bed” exercise 
just described. Here, in addition to having the head off the bed, 
you also raise your arms all the way and let them also hang off 
the bed.



142 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 47

What this adds to the exercise is that now you can also not use 
the pectoral muscles (the breast muscles) to raise the chest 
instead of the muscles between the ribs to expand the chest.

Since we are always interested in getting the chest to move 
with the proper muscles of respiration (the muscles between the 
ribs), use of this exercise is put off until you have that part 
mastered. Use the tailor’s tape measure to see that the chest is 
expanding. What you do here is use a paper clip to hold the tape 
measure at the full exhale position and then do the hands over 
head and breathe to see if the chest diameter increases.

Figure 48



Chapter 8, Advanced breathinig                 143

CHAPTER 8

ADVANCED BREATHING

Except for the first exercise below, the “no sound” exercise, 
don’t try these advanced breathing techniques until you have all 
the basics mastered and especially until you have the chest and 
belly moving properly.

NO SOUND 

For some people the ‘ah’ sound serves as almost a distraction. 
So much effort is put into making the proper sound that it effects 
the rhythm of the breathing. The person concentrates on making 
the proper sound and in doing so is unable to let the breath 
process proceed smoothly.

There is no harm in dropping the sound. This is done for either 
of two reasons. One, is when you are concentrating so hard on the 
sound that it is disrupting or might be disrupting your breathing. 
Then drop the sound so that you can focus on the feel of natural 
full breathing. You breathe all day long and all night long and 
you do not concentrate on it. It should be the same in these 
exercises. At first concentration is necessary because you are 

No sound to start the exhale.
Getting rid of the breath sound from the throat during

 the breath (especially during the exhale)
Rhythmic breathing

There should be no difference in your exhale with or
without the ‘ah’ sound.



144 Reichian technique, Part One     

learning to breathe in a proper manner. But in time the whole 
cycle should become so natural that it does not take any mental 
focus. It simply feels right.

The second reason is after you have mastered the normal 
breathing and sound, it can be productive to just pay attention to 
the feel of deep breathing with rhythm. With no sound there is 
less of a tendency to have a pause between an inhale and an 
exhale. They just follow one on the other. 

‘AH’ WITH NO THROAT SOUND 

This is one of the most interesting aspects of proper breathing. 
Yet I have held it to near the end of Part One of the book because 
it is one of those things which is easy to say but seemingly 
difficult for most people to do. 

One of the very strange things about deep breathing is that 
while in fact it is done by the diaphragm and the rib muscles, still 
most people breathe with their throat. How, you might ask? Well, 
right, you can’t breathe with your throat but still that is how most 
people approach their deep breathing. If that seems strange, listen 
to the Sounds of Reichian audio. You can hear it there.

So, how? Well, people treat a deep inhale as though they were 
inhaling to the throat and even more on the exhale; they control 
the exhale by tensing the throat muscles. 

How can you tell if you are doing that and what can you do 
about it? That’s what I address here.

Let’s start with the inhale even though this is less of a problem 
than the exhale. The issue here is to see where you are putting 
your focus during the inhale. Since the inhale is belly then chest it 
is usually the case that the belly breathing is easy while the chest 
breathing is throat-controlled. There are exceptions where the 
chest is easy and the belly difficult, but that is not as common. 

In learning to breathe without breath sounds, start with 
focusing during the inhale on your belly, that is drawing in the air 
and then your chest that is drawing in the air. Recall that you do 

Here you learn to open your throat and not control your
breathing by tension in the throat.



Chapter 8, Advanced breathinig                 145
not inhale as such, you simply balloon out the belly and then 
expand the chest. The air comes in by itself (to fill the vacuum) 
rather than you drawing it in. If you need to: (1) drop the ‘ah’ 
sound on the exhale and (2) do belly only breathing, then chest 
only breathing. Get the distinct feel of how you are not inhaling 
as an active process, rather you are ballooning the belly and 
expanding the chest as the active processes. 

Now the more difficult one, the exhale. Here there is a very 
definite indication of how you might be breathing with your 
throat rather than with the body. The indication is a soft rasping 
sound during the exhale after the ‘ah’ sound. In other words the 
exhale produces a sound from the throat. This throat sound can be 
heard on the Sounds of Reichian audio.

Try this. Take a deep complete breath through your nose. Do 
you hear any sound during the exhale? Now take the same 
complete breath through your mouth. Now do you hear a sound 
during the exhale? You shouldn’t. It is the same breath, the same 
inhale and exhale whether done through the nose or done through 
the mouth.

When your throat is open during the exhale and you are not 
trying to control the exhale from the throat, then there is no sound 
at all except the sound of the air itself. This sound is almost 
inaudible. If you can distinctly hear the exhale while it is 
happening, then you are still breathing from the throat. Instead of 
allowing the relaxation of the diaphragm and the natural fall of 
the chest to expel the air, you are attempting to control the 
outflow of the air from your throat.

While I call this exercise ‘ah with no breath sound,’ it does not 
in any way compromise the exercise if you drop the ‘ah’ sound. 
The issue is learning by experience that the body can be trusted to 
do its job without you having to control it or make sure it does it 
right.

It may surprise you to find that you are afraid to just let the air 
exit in a completely uncontrolled manner; to simply let the body 
(belly and chest) be the controller. 

The thought of letting the body take care of everything 
without conscious control and monitoring is especially difficult 
for people who have issues with suspicion, control, doing it right, 
or a lack of trust that they will do things properly if they do not 



146 Reichian technique, Part One     

control each aspect of it. You can see how mastering this exercise 
can have a profound effect on your nature. To let go of issues that 
interfere with living life pleasurably instead of by having 
everything just right.
 

RHYTHMIC BREATHING 

This is the last of the exercises in Part One of the book. But 
don’t expect it to be mastered easily. The work you have done 
above on the ‘ah with no breath sound’ is an essential preparatory 
step for this exercise. Here you are going to go the last step, to 
fully letting go of control.

They way I describe this is to say: think of a pendulum. It 
swings back and forth on a constant arc, each swing takes the 
same amount of time and the time of the up stroke in one 
direction is the same as the time for the up stroke in the other 
direction. 

The other way to look at this is that the inhale causes the 
exhale which causes the inhale which causes the exhale and so 
on. The deeper the inhale gets the more the body wants to exhale 
and the deeper the exhale the more the body wants to inhale. 
There is no longer even a trace of the idea of first inhaling and 
then exhaling as two separate steps. Breathing is simply 
continuous, deep, and rhythmic. The feeling you will get 
throughout your body when you do this properly is not capable of 
being put into words. Our language simply lacks words for this 
feeling. The best I can say is that this feeling of freedom and 
simple rightness is felt throughout the body, not simply in the 
belly and chest.

By the time you have mastered this last step you will more 
than likely have discovered profound changes in yourself.

The final letting go of control. The final learning to trust
the natural rhythm of your body.

Like a pendulum, the inhale causes the exhale which
causes the inhale.



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             147

CHAPTER 9

WORKING WITH A HELPER

HELP WITH THE EXERCISES

If you have room in the bedroom, place a chair by the side of 
the bed so the helper can observe the exercises. Usually the 
helper will just be observing and gently pointing out changes in 
the breathing during an exercise or pointing out problems with 
the way and exercise is being done.

Figure 49

The helper’s main task for Part One of this book is to help 
with learning to breathe properly. Very few people at the start of 

HELP WITH THE EXERCISES
HELP BY USING PRESSURE



148 Reichian technique, Part One     

their work are able to breathe properly. Thus this is the first thing 
with which the helper will help. 

I have discussed that some people hold their chest in a chronic 
inhale position, some hold it in a chronic exhale position and 
some are able to breathe properly into the chest. If the worker can 
not initially use the chest, that should not be corrected. Getting 
the chest down (chronic inhale) or up (chronic exhale) will come 
in time as the work proceeds. The first issue is simply getting 
accustomed to the rhythm of belly then chest in the inhale and 
belly then chest in the exhale. 

Also some people can not breathe into the belly. They can get 
a small amount of movement in the diaphragm but not enough to 
actually make much of a difference in the breath. 

So the helper simply sits in the chair and observes the rhythm 
of the breath and comments on whether the sequence of 
movement is correct or not.

NOW DON’T NAG! 

Making a comment about each and every breath is only to be a 
damn nuisance. 

The other thing the helper can do initially is to correct the 
sound if it is anything other than an ‘ah’ sound or if the ‘ah’ 
sound is articulated or has a guttural (see pages 79-81 for the list 
of possible sounds and have the helper listen to the audio). It is 
extremely likely, that is it is common, that initially the working 
person will have a two-phase breath. He or she will first do the 
inhale and then do the exhale rather than having the two actions 
be a continuous process. That should be left until much later in 
the work. Don’t forget the sensing-and-feeling report at the end 
of the session as discussed on page 21.

Also recall that the breathing can produce muscle spasms, 
most often in the hands and wrist. Usually this passes in a few 
sessions or it passes when a calcium and magnesium supplement 
is added. It may also be corrected by the swim kick exercise 
presented in Part Two of this book, Chapter 20 at page 292. 
Occasionally these muscle spasms occur in other parts of the 
body like the back of the neck or the legs. This is just a variant 
and has no special meaning. If the spasm becomes painful, 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             149
simply stop the session for a few minutes until the spasm passes, 
then restart. If the spasm is mild and in the back of the neck, the 
helper can adjust the worker’s neck as shown below in Figure 50. 

Actually, the adjustment in Figure 50 doesn’t apply only to 
spasms in the back of the neck. It is a common device or defense 
in this work for the worker to tense the back of the neck so that 
the chin points upward as in the top left photograph in Figure 50. 
When you see this, an easy adjustment as in the bottom left 
photograph can correct it. However, let me repeat my oft stated 
caution: it is better to leave a minor error than it is to be 
correcting all the time. If you keep correcting this or any other 
minor error, you are simply teaching the worker that this work is 
a performance that must be done correctly rather than a course in 
self-improvement.

 

Figure 50

CHEST EXPANSION 



150 Reichian technique, Part One     

The first contribution the helper can make is to check for chest 
expansion. This is easily accomplished. With the hands placed as 
shown in the top panel of Figure 51, the worker then does a full 
inhale. If the chest is expanding (rather than merely rising) the 
thumbs will separate as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 51. 
In the case of female workers, the approach is from the feet 
(rather than from the head, as shown) with the hands placed 
below the breasts.

Figure 51

As the work progresses, the chest expansion should increase. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this book, the amount of 
expansion will vary with the basic chest shape (INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES on page 66) the helper should measure the chest 
expansion several times so that the helper knows the amount of 
movement for the particular worker and thus the helper can 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             151
monitor the increase of movement over time. Note, however, that 
the amount of expansion will change from one session to another. 
There may be good expansion in one session and no expansion or 
much less expansion in another session. Similarly the worker 
may generally have no movement and then on one session the 
movement appears but does not hold over the session or to the 
next session. All of these changes are indications that the work is 
doing its job. 

BREATHE BELLY ONLY 

The helper here can inform the worker whether the belly is 
being fully filled. Even for people whose abdominal muscles are 
capable of relaxing, it is common for there to be tension in either 
the upper part of the belly (near the diaphragm) or the lower belly 
(just above the genitals). It does no good to harp on an area of 
tension, simply point it out and wait to see if the worker can let 
go of the tension. If not, there is always the next time. Repeatedly 
pointing out an area of tension simply makes the helper into a 
parent. 

Here the belly should only be ballooning out on the inhale and 
relaxing on the exhale. The helper can often see that the belly is 
tensing during the inhale or during the exhale while the worker 
can not feel the tensing at all. Then the helper can place the 
workers hands on the top and bottom of the belly so that the 
worker can feel the tension.

BREATHE CHEST ONLY 

This is, generally, harder to do than the breathe belly only. 
Here the helper wants to check that (1) the belly is not tensed at 
the beginning of the inhale, and (2) that the chest expands rather 
than just rises. 

If the belly tenses then the helper first points out that fact and 
then, if it is not capable of being corrected, the helper uses 
moderate pressure on the diaphragm during the whole of the 
exercise. The pressure is discussed in a subsequent part of this 
chapter in the section entitled THE DIAPHRAGM on page 157.



152 Reichian technique, Part One     

This is a good point to repeat that this is not a race. These 
changes take time and effort, to change yourself too quickly can 
damage rather than help. In Part One of this book on Reichian 
work at home I am only concerned with breathing. If this takes 
months, even years, that is what the worker’s psychology 
demands and it should not be rushed. ALLWAYS TOO 
SLOWLY.

First get the breathing to be belly then chest on the inhale and 
the exhale. Then start with the forehead and eye exercises in Part 
Two. Then learn to breathe belly only and only then learn to 
breathe chest only. Then proceed on to the other breath work and 
at this point you can also proceed on to the various body area 
exercises. 

If the diaphragm is being used to push the chest up, then you 
will likely need to use pressure on the diaphragm as discussed 
later in this chapter. If the chest can not be used because it is held 
in chronic inhale then the helper can aid the worker by attempting 
to soften the accessory muscles with pressure. If the chest is held 
in chronic exhale, then that can be helped by the next exercise.

EXTEND THE BELLY, BREATHE CHEST 
ONLY 

For people whose chest is held down this is a very tiring 
exercise and the worker will have a tendency to use the belly 
despite trying not to. The helper can watch for tension in the belly 
and place the worker’s hands at the top and bottom of the belly if 
it is tensing. Also if the worker is able to do some breaths 
correctly, the worker may tire quickly and then start to tense the 
belly. The helper can watch for that so the worker can stop the 
exercise for that session.

For people whose chest is held high, this exercise should be 
held off until the next exercise, the push breathing, gets the chest 
down.

PUSH BREATHING 

To repeat, these are the elements of this exercise:



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             153

1. full inhale
2. roll the pelvis with the ‘ah’ sound
3. at the end of the normal exhale, push out the belly and 

then push out all the air from the chest
4. after all the air is pushed out of the chest, lower the pelvis 

(lower not drop) and continue with the next inhale.

The helper can be of great assistance to see that (1) the rolling 
of the pelvis is done at the same time as the ‘ah’ sound, (2) that 
the pelvis is rolled without lifting the back and without spreading 
the legs and (3) that the pelvis is held up for the full exhale 
including the pushing. 

If the roll is done after the ‘ah’ sound instead of at the same 
time, the helper can tell the worker about it but, again, don’t nag. 

If the roll includes lifting the back off the bed, the helper can 
push the abdomen down while he lifts the pelvis as shown in 
Figure 52.

Figure 52

If the legs are being spread during the roll, the helper can 
gently hold them so that they do not spread. This is shown in 
Figure 53. Note that this exercise is also discussed in somewhat 
greater detail in Chapter 18 starting on page 281.



154 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 53

GASP INHALE BELLY 
GASP INHALE CHEST 
GASP EXHALE BELLY 
GASP EXHALE CHEST 

There is little that the helper can do for the worker on the gasp 
exercises except to call the worker’s attention to when the gasp 
slows down and is really a quick inhale or exhale rather than a 
gasp or when the worker is not gasping with only the chest or 
only the belly (that is, the non-selected area is also moving or 
tensing). 

CRY BREATHING 

No helper activity needed. If the worker does start to cry, the 
helper should remind the worker to make sound with the crying. 
Recall: never cry quietly.

SEE-SAW BREATHING 

The helper can be valuable on this exercise by pointing out if 
the see-saw action is slow or the exhale (to the belly) does not 
show a full expansion of the belly. 

This exercise, more than any other, produces a state of 
hyperventilation (recall: that results in a blowing off of carbon 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             155
dioxide in the blood and a 30% to 50% reduction in blood flow to 
the brain). If the worker is initially able to do this exercise but the 
performance quickly degrades, then the helper should tell the 
worker to stop the exercise. In any event, this exercise should 
continue for only a short time (probably five minutes is 
excessive).

SIDE BEND 

Here the helper can make sure that the arm over the head is 
directly over the body (there is a tendency for the arm to be 
forward of the line of the body) and if the worker is bending 
forward rather than being straight up.

The use of a pillow in this exercise is discussed on pages 130

or perhaps adding more pillows to fully force the head to the 
cheat, there is nothing more the helper can do.

SIDE HEAD POSTURE



156 Reichian technique, Part One     

The helper can use pressure as shown in Figure 65 on page 
168. Other than helping with pressure, the is no helper action 
needed.

NO THROAT SOUND 

The helper here can point out if there is still a throat sound on 
the inhale or the exhale.

RHYTHMIC BREATHING 

It is relatively easy for the helper to see if the breathing is truly 
rhythmic or if there is a slight pause at either the end of the inhale 
or the end of the exhale. It is usually difficult initially for the 
worker to feel these pauses so  the helper’s pointing out any 
pauses (without nagging) is useful.

True rhythmic breathing requires that the worker be willing to 
relinquish control and just feel the way the body moves when 
doing rhythmic breathing. It usually takes quiet a bit of practice 
but the result is worth the practice.

HELP BY USING PRESSURE

CHECKING AND CORRECTING USE OF THE 
ACCESSORY MUSCLES 

The only pressure I am discussing here is pressure related 
to helping the full breathing. In Part Two, when I discuss 
each of the areas of the body, I will present ways the helper 
can use pressure for each of the body areas.

Since I am concerned with breathing, that means I am  
concerned with using the diaphragm, using the muscles 
between the ribs and not using the accessory muscles. 

For convenience I will present this material first by using 
the accessory muscles as our guide and then discuss 
separately the use of pressure on the abdomen.



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             157

First a quick review. All of the following are possible 
accessory muscles of respiration:

1. the diaphragm
2. the pectorals (at the top side of the chest)
3. the muscle at the front of the neck (sternocleidomastoid)
4. the muscles at the side of the neck

a. the front side of the neck (anterior scalene)
b. the middle side of the neck (medial scalene)
c. the back side of the neck (posterior scalene)

5. the trapezius muscles

Below, as I discuss each of the muscles, I will talk about using 
pressure. As you might expect the helpful (as opposed to only 
painful) pressure is less if the worker is a female and more if the 
worker is a male. If the helper is a female and her finger nails are 
getting in the way of pressure or are digging into the skin, then 
they need to be trimmed. 

THE DIAPHRAGM

The diaphragm is tight in many people. This is true even for 
people who seem to be able to breathe into the belly. The helper 
can have a vital role in relaxing the diaphragm. First the helper 
must learn to feel the diaphragm. The position is shown in Figure 
54. While it is not evident from Figure 54, the helper’s fingers are 
immediately beneath the lowest (12th) rib and actually angled 
upward so that any diaphragm movement can be felt (the 
diaphragm is attached to the lowest rib). 

As the worker breathes, the helper should feel for movement 
in the diaphragm. It is a subtle feeling. The helper’s fingers 
should press lightly into the belly with a slight upward tilt of the 
hand as shown below. If the diaphragm moves, the helper will 
feel a slight rolling of the diaphragm under the fingers and the 
diaphragm will feel soft. In some people the diaphragm does 
move but it feels hard under the fingers. So there should be 
movement and softness at the same time.



158 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 54

If the diaphragm does not move or it is felt to be hard (rigid), 
then the helper can aid in clearing this chronic tension. For a 
whole session (about 50 minutes) or as long as the helper can 
hold the pressure, put a mild pressure to the fingers. I have 
exaggerated this pressure in the figure above. In reality there 
would not be this much difference between feeling and pressing.

In addition to moderate and prolonged pressure on the 
diaphragm, there is another way that the helper can aid in the 
freeing of the diaphragm. This is shown in Figure 55. Here 
pressure is put on the 7th through 9th ribs, either preventing their 
outward movement (Figure 55, left) or pressing them downward 
toward the bed (Figure 55, right). In most people the ribs are 
attached to the breast bone (the sternum) only by cartilage, not by 
bone. Thus they are quite flexible. The pressure used is only 
enough to keep the ribs slightly compressed. This compression 
tends to prevent the diaphragm from being used to force the chest 
up from the bottom. Another method of preventing diaphragm 
use is pressure on the abdomen. This is discussed below in the 
section on THE ABDOMEN.



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             159

Figure 55

THE ABDOMEN

This pressure can be very tiring on the helper (Figure 56), so 
just do it as long as it does not wear you out.

The purpose of this pressure and why it is included in Part 
One of the book on breathing is that it is another way to stop the 
use of the diaphragm to push the chest up. The idea is to press in 
on the abdomen to keep if from expanding or tensing. This 
pressure, especially if the worker does not tense against the 
pressure during the inhale, can greatly aid the worker in learning 
to use the muscles between the ribs as opposed to using the 
diaphragm to push the chest up.

Figure 56



160 Reichian technique, Part One     

THE PECTORALS 

The helper can easily feel the tension in the pectoral muscles. 
If the muscles are relaxed they are both soft (no felt tension) and 
they feel like corduroy. When I say a muscle feels like corduroy I 
mean that the helper can feel, as he or she moves his or her 
fingers across the muscle, the individual muscle fibers just as 
though one were rubbing corduroy cloth. 

If the pectoral muscle is tight, then there are several possible 
ways to get it to relax. One is simply to put gentle pressure on the 
whole muscle and hold it for as long as possible without tiring 
while the worker breathes. This is shown in the next photo.

If the worker is female, the pressure should be above any 
breast tissue. Pressure on breast tissue is very painful with 
absolutely no benefit. We are interested in muscles, not the 
glandular fat tissue of the breast.

Figure 57

If this gentle pressure does not work after a complete session 
of breathing, then more forceful pressure can be used (Figure 58). 
Using the knuckles is much easier on the helper and is often more 
effective than keeping the fingers straight as in the above photo.



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             161

Figure 58

 This pressure can be somewhat painful. Pain IS NOT the 
goal. The goal is getting the muscles to let go of their chronic 
tension. This might be a good place to illustrate the idea that 
pressure on tense muscles can cause pain but pain is not the goal, 
it is an unfortunate side effect.

Start with your arm straight. Now grip your biceps muscle 
using as much pressure as you can apply. Now slowly bend your 
arm and feel, as you bend, the change of the feeling in your arm 
from one of pressure to one of near pain. With your arm straight, 
the biceps is relatively relaxed (weight lifters may have chronic 
tension in this muscle). As you bend your arm the biceps gets 
increasingly tense. This is an easy way to feel the difference 
between pressure on a relaxed muscle and pressure on a tense 
muscle. In Figure 59 the left panel shows the pressure on the 
biceps while the right panel shows the arm bent with the same 
degree of pressure on the biceps.



162 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 59

Returning to our discussion of the pectoral tension, if the 
gentle pressure does not work then knuckle pressure can be used. 
The amount  of  pressure used should be enough to be 
uncomfortable and slightly painful but not to be extremely 
painful. Keep in mind that there is pain only with an overly tense 
muscle and that the same pressure on a relaxed muscle is not 
painful. The implication of this is that as the pectoral tension 
gradually lessens over time then more pressure can be applied 
until there is no tension in the muscle.

THE MUSCLES AT THE FRONT OF THE NECK 

The muscle at the front of the neck which concerns us is the 
sternocleidomastoid. It is easy to feel the tension in this muscle 
(Figure 60 on page 163). Lightly pinch the muscle during a 
breath cycle. If these muscles are being used you will easily feel 
(and see) the tensing.

While the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) is a major accessory 
muscle of inhalation, pressure here is used only when absolutely 
necessary. The amount of pain produced with pinching this 
muscle is often not worth the benefit. The use of a pillow was 
discussed at THE MUSCLES IN THE FRONT OF THE NECK
on pages 130 through 133. The helper can greatly assist the 
worker by placing the pillow and moving it as needed to insure 
that the head is firmly pushed against the chest.

The only way to apply pressure to the sternocleidomastoid is 
to pinch it (Figure 60). This means that pressure is being applied 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             163
to the same muscle from two different directions, in effect, the 
degree of pressure is doubled. As is often the case, moderate but 
sustained pressure is the best answer. The pressure can be applied 
at the end of the muscle near the collar bone and again in the 
middle of the muscle (about mid-neck). If you want to get an idea 
of how much pain is produced in this muscle by pressure, put 
your head back and then pinch your own SCM. As you can feel, 
it does not take much pressure to produce a lot of pain. As 
always, pain is not what we are after.

  

Figure 60

It is truly amazing how much trouble is caused by 
tension in the neck. You can think of it as a choke 
point separating the intellect from the emotions or 
as the point of separation of thinking from the 
acting. One way to look at body-based 
psychotherapy is getting the thinking and feeling 
working together. Wouldn’t that be nice? 

While we’re on the subject, consider why so many 
people get so tense in their shoulders and why it 
feels so good to have a massage? Or think about the 
number of people who get tension headaches or the 
number of people who have pain in the back of their 
neck from the muscle tension there. 



164 Reichian technique, Part One     

THE MUSCLES AT THE SIDE OF THE NECK

Anatomy Of The Neck

There are no medical reasons why pressure can not be applied 
to the side (and the back) of the neck. However, both to locate 
these muscles and know where to apply the pressure, we have to 
go through some anatomy. Don’t be scared of this, it is relatively 
simple and, best of all, there won’t be any midterm exam.

Our discussion is based on Figure 61.

Figure 61

I’ll start with just pointing out the items in the figure. You are 
looking at the right side of the neck. The first muscle on the right

C. back of the side of the neck

Another way for the helper to aid the worker to open the
neck



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             165
is the one we have already discussed, the sternocleidomastoid 
(SCM). That is the muscle I am pinching in Figure 60 on page 
163 and the muscle that is highlighted by arrows in Figure 39 on 
page 132. 

Before continuing, a note on the anatomy diagram: everyone 
has the same anatomy but not in the same exact place and not the 
same exact size. Everyone is slightly different. In the diagram I 
have made some of the muscles bigger than they normally are so 
that it is easier to talk about them. I have also left out some things 
that we are not concerned with or that made the diagram just too 
messy to easily talk about.

OK, just behind the SCM is one of the three scalene muscles. I 
have drawn this muscle considerably larger than it usually is. 
Instead of coming almost half way up the neck as I have it, 
usually you can barely feel it right at the clavicle. We will go 
over all this again when we talk about pressure on each of these 
muscles.

Directly behind the anterior scalene is the medial scalene. 
Usually you can, if you practice, find this muscle by the slight 
indentation that is just before it. That is, as you move from the 
anterior scalene backward your finger will feel just the slightest 
indentation before it comes onto the reasonably prominent 
medial scalene. We will return in a moment to the issue of the 
anterior scalene and the medial scalene after we finish with the 
muscles in the diagram.

Just behind (posterior) to the medical scalene is the posterior 
scalene. The easiest way to find this one is to place your finger on 
the trapezius and then slowly forward until you fall off (or sink in 
slightly) from the trapezius.

Figure 61 also shows another muscle at the top back of the 
side of the neck. This is the splenius capitus, you can ignore that 
muscle. It has little relevance to this work.

The only other muscle is the levator scapulae. This muscle 
runs all the way down to the scapula (the wing bone). As Figure 
61 indicates, if you place you finger in about the middle of the 
side of the neck on the trapezius and then come slightly forward 
you will fall off the trapezius and be on the levator scapulae. 



166 Reichian technique, Part One     

For the anatomists among my readers, I know I have left out 
the omohyoideus but it is usually small and has no importance for 
this work.

Now, before I continue, I have to cover another anatomy issue 
at the side of the neck. It is nothing to worry about, it is not a 
health issue or a danger warning. I deliberately left it out of 
Figure 61 since it makes the diagram too difficult to follow but it 
is not that hard to describe it in words.

See if you can picture this. The nerves that feed your arm and 
upper chest and upper back exit from the spinal column in the 
neck region. They pass, as a bundle, through the side of the neck, 
pass under the clavicle and then outward from there. As this 
nerve bundle passes out through the side of the neck it passes 
between the anterior scalene and the medial scalene. Whether it 
passes between the muscles at the bottom of the neck or in the 
middle of the neck varies from one person to another and even 
differently from the right side of the neck to the left side of the 
neck on the same person. When you are using pressure on the 
anterior scalene or the medial scalene you might produce 
radiating pain into the arm or the upper back because you are 
pressing on this nerve bundle. This pain is unnecessary; it does 
not accomplish anything for this work. Simply move your finger 
off that spot and move upward or downward as needed to get 
away from this nerve bundle. I’ll come back to this shortly with 
some photographs.

Now let’s turn back to the work at hand.

Front Side Of The Neck (anterior scalene)

To locate the muscle at the front side of the neck, very lightly 
pinch the SCM muscle at the front of the neck with your first 
finger at the front of the neck and your thumb at the side. In this 
position your thumb is now on the muscle at the front side of the 
neck (Figure 62 at arrow).

You can apply moderate pressure to this muscle (the anterior 
scalene) either with your first finger or with your thumb. Note the 
direction of the pressure in Figure 63. The muscle you are 
applying pressure to is hard to get to because of other muscles 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             167
which cover it. To apply pressure, the direction of the pressure 
should be down toward the feet and slightly toward the bed.

Figure 62

Figure 63

Middle Side Of The Neck (medial scalene)

This muscle (the medial scalene) is a little more difficult to 
locate but once you have done it the first time it will not be a 
problem after that. Here is how to locate the medial scalene.

With you first finger on the anterior scalene (above, Figure 
63) start slowly moving backward toward the bed. The first 
muscle you will pass over is a tiny muscle we don’t care about. It 
is a long muscle in that it travels far in the body, but it has not 



168 Reichian technique, Part One     

effect on breathing and is not even shown in Figure 61 on page 
164. This tiny muscle lies almost against the medial scalene so it 
may or may not be felt (there is a picture of this muscle in Figure 
86 on page 215 when it bulges during the jaw open exercise). 

The next and major muscle you will feel is the one we are 
trying to locate, the medial scalene. Except in the rare case where 
it is not tense, it is big and tight and you can not miss it.

You can use pressure at either the lowest point at the bottom 
of the neck or higher abut 2/3 of the way to the jaw (Figure 64).

Figure 64

Another way the helper can aid the worker is by pressing the 
head against the shoulder (Figure 65). This can be tiring on the 
helper, so sides should be changed as needed. 

Figure 65

Back Side of the Neck (posterior scalene)



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             169
Now you are going to locate the posterior scalene for pressure. 

This is easy to locate once you have located the medial scalene. 
As you move your finger backward (toward the bed) you will feel 
a very slight kind of indentation between the two muscles 
(between the medial scalene and the posterior scalene). This is 
not a big indentation, it is simply a place where your finger goes 
just a tiny bit more into the neck (assuming your finger is 
pointing toward the other side of the neck). Behind this slight 
indentation you will come upon another very prominent muscle. 
This is the posterior scalene.

If you move rapidly backward from the medial scalene you 
can easily miss the posterior scalene and confuse it with the front 
fibers of the trapezius (which we will look at next). So move 
slowly the first few times you locate the posterior scalene so you 
can become accustomed to the feel of the movement and the feel 
of the muscle.

Pressure on this muscle is directly into the neck (that is, side to 
side). This is illustrated in Figure 66. 

Figure 66

 
The Trapezius Muscles

The trapezius is shown in the next figure, 



170 Reichian technique, Part One     

Figure 67

This muscle runs from all along the cervical (neck) and 
thoracic spine (thorax simply means chest or upper back) to the 
outer part of the scapula (wing bone) and, most important, to the 
base of the skull. It is the main muscle used to keep our head 
from falling forward (the head is front heavy and would fall 
forward onto the chest if it were not held back by muscles at the 
back of the neck). I will look next at what the helper can do with 
the trapezius muscle, but here I have to emphasize a bit of the 
anatomy of this muscle. Above, I have drawn two circles; and a 
box on the left side. The two circles indicate where, in fact, you 
are applying pressure to the front fibers of the trapezius. You’ll 
see this shortly when we look at Figure 68. Now look closely at 
that boxed area. Hopefully you can see that the trapezius muscle 
actually twists in this area such that muscle fibers that were in the 
front of the muscle are now on the side of the muscle. The best 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             171
place to get at these twisting muscle fibers is at the back of the 
neck area. Well cover that when we get to Figure 69.

Front Fibers Of The Trapezius Muscle

Pressure here can work wonders. However, the pressure can 
also be hard on the helper. First the finger nails must be clipped. 
The pressure is with the ends of the fingers or the thumbs so the 
nails must be clipped.

The pressure must be directed to the right place and in the 
right direction. The pressure should be as long as the helper can 
tolerate and as strong as the worker can tolerate. Ideally, pressure 
should be on both side of the neck at the same time. If your hands 
or strength in your arms can not do both sides at the same time, 
then simply alternate between the right and the left sides.

Figure 68

The way to get to these fibers of the trapezius muscle is 
simply to change the direction of pressure you were using on the 
back muscle of the side of the neck. In the figure above (Figure 
68) note that the direction of finger pressure on the back muscles 
of the side of the neck. For pressure on the front fibers of the 
trapezius the elbow is raised and the direction of pressure is 
downward towards the feet and backward toward the bed. 

THE FRONT FIBERS OF THE TRAPEZIUS
THE BACK FIBERS OF THE TRAPEZIUS



172 Reichian technique, Part One     

Harking back to Figure 67 on page 170, we are putting pressure 
on the circles on the diagram.

That may seem difficult, but you will get it quickly and be 
able to go directly to this pressure on future sessions. 

Back Fibers Of The Trapezius Muscle

Here, again, the helper can aid the worker by using pressure. 
As always, pressure here will require that the finger nails be 
clipped and filed so that the nails do not dig into the skin. 

What I have done here is to cut out a part of Figure 67 to 
highlight just the back of the neck region.

Figure 69

You can see in Figure 69 that there are three muscles at the 
back of the neck The muscle coming all the way up on the 
extreme right and extreme left pointed to by the arrow on the 
right is just that old SCM muscle again. The upward sloping line 
on the right points to the levator scapulae muscle. It has no effect 
on breathing and thus we ignore it. However, in most people this 
muscle is very tight and thus pressure on it is quite painful. This 
muscle should be avoided. Avoiding this muscle is easy, as the 
next paragraph will explain. 

We care only about the trapezius muscle which is in the center 
of the figure (horizontal line on the left of the figure). As you can 
see, at the base of the neck the trapezius occupies the whole area. 
As you move upward the trapezius narrows to be only near the 
spinal column. Therefore as you move upward with your 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             173
pressure, you also move inward toward the spine. The pain that 
may result from pressure on the trapezius feels, to the worker, 
very different from the pain if you happen to get onto the levator 
scapulae muscle. There is no harm, simply move your fingers or 
the pressure device23 nearer to the spinal column.

 

Figure 70

Figure 70 shows two ways to put pressure on the trapezius. 
Note that in both cases the head is turned to the side.

THE MUSCLES BETWEEN THE RIBS

The single most effective pressure for freeing the chest is 
pressure on the small muscle between the ribs. This pressure, in 
almost all people, is quite painful. Unfortunately, there is no way 
to get away from this pain and still get the effect. That is not to 
say that this is an excuse for some minor sadism; rather like most 
pressure it should be done to the level of toleration of the worker. 
This is a place, however, where the worker should accept as 
much pain as he (she) can tolerate. Remember, pain is only 
present when a muscle is overly tense. When the muscles 
between the ribs release their held tension, the pain all but 
disappears.

The anatomy of the muscle between the ribs is shown in 
Figure 16 on page 71. I noted there that: “The external intercostal 
muscles are used during inhalation. They extend from about 

23.Pressure devices are shown in Figure 134 on page 316 and Figure 
135 on page 317.



174 Reichian technique, Part One     

under the nipple line around back all the way to the spine. The 
internal intercostal muscles are used during (forced) expiration. 
They run from your breast bone around the side and to about mid 
back.”

Let’s consider that description. If the helper uses pressure just 
next to the breast bone, he (she) is putting pressure on the internal 
intercostal muscle and that will have its major effect on the 
worker’s ability to exhale. As one would say in Reichian therapy, 
it will have its major effect on allowing a full exhale. 

If pressure is applied on the muscles at side of the chest, then 
the pressure would be applied to both sets of intercostal muscles.

Just as pressure at the breast bone only affects the internal 
intercostal muscle, so ideally we would like to be able to apply 
pressure only on the external intercostal muscle. Unfortunately, 
that is not possible. The only area where there is only external 
intercostal muscle is near the spine. Next to the spine there is 
such a thickness of other muscles that we can not get to the 
intercostal muscles.

Thus for pressure on the intercostal muscles we use pressure 
next to the breast bone and then along the line of the ribs to about 
the middle of the side. It does little good to have the worker turn 
over so that the back of the ribs is exposed. Even when one goes, 
let’s say, in the middle of the back one is pressing through the 
trapezius muscle to try to get to the intercostal muscles and that 
just doesn’t work all that well. Consult the diagram on page 170
and you can see how other muscles in the back are covering the 
ribs.

Pressure between the ribs near the breast bone is best done 
with the knuckle of the first finger. Do both sides at the same 
time if you can. You can also use a tool like the one shown in 
Figure 135 on page 317. Start at the muscle between the 1st and 
2nd ribs and work down. Don’t get confused by the collar bone. 
There is a muscle under the collar bone, but it has been 
deliberately ignored in this discussion. 

Here, again, we have to make a distinction between a male 
worker and a female worker. Pressure on female breast tissue is 
painful and OF NO PURPOSE. If the worker is a female then try 
to move the breast tissue out of the way; don’t press through 
breast tissue. That, in turn, means that work on the intercostal 



Chapter 9, Working with a helper             175
muscles on females can only be done right next to the breastbone 
(where this is minimal or no breast tissue) and on the side of the 
chest — where breast tissue prevents work on the center of the 
chest — but then back again to the center and side beneath the 
breast tissue.

For males, pressure can be applied to the intercostal muscles 
over the whole extent of the chest.

For pressure on the intercostal muscles other than right next to 
the breast bone, the most effective way is with the thumb. That 
can quickly become uncomfortable for the helper. The thumb 
may be supported by wrapping the first finger behind and around 
the thumb.

That’s a lot of data, but a little review never hurts.
1.  We had mild but continuous pressure on the diaphragm.
2. We had downward pressure on the lower ribs also to work 

on the use of the diaphragm.

Chapter 10, Introduction to part two             177

CHAPTER 10

INTRODUCTION TO PART TWO

Welcome to Part Two of the book. Here I am going to go over 
all the areas of the body giving you the exercises for each area. 

A reasonable question which you might have is whether you 
can start this work even though you have not nearly finished the 
work on the breathing that I presented in Part One. The answer is 
not as easy as the question. 

Different areas of the body contain different amounts and even 
kinds of tension. They have different effects on our nature and 
feelings. Therefore, reasonably, the answer is yes for this 
exercise, no for that exercise, and somewhat for another exercise. 
Therefore throughout this part of the book I will say which areas 
or even exercises in any given area may be done before, after, or 
during your work on the breathing in Part One.

Recall that I emphasized repeatedly in Part One that the rule 
of the work is: always too slowly. Your nature and your 
relationship to your body do not want to change, they want to 
stay the same. Even if you are consciously committed to change, 
your subconscious is just as committed to not changing. In the 
way human beings are constructed, in a contest between the 
conscious and the subconscious the subconscious will win. By 
will and choice you have control of your voluntary muscles, but 
your subconscious has control of all the rest of your body. In 
pictures, if your will is a race horse, your subconscious is a mule. 

Now, as always, the choice is yours. You can believe the 
nearly 65 years of experience of Dr. Willis and Dr. Regardie or 
you can think you know better. But if all the caution I have 
indicated is not sufficient for you, I will add one more reason to 
move cautiously. There is phenomena in this work called “a 
holding state.” This happens when more advanced work is done 
before prior work makes the subconscious system ready to accept 



178 Reichian technique, Part Two

the new challenge. In a holding state the more advanced work, 
done before you are ready for it, causes other areas to become set 
and rigid in their holding pattern such that they can not be broken 
through. Holding states are bad, steady progress is good. 

I want to add one more description here before I get into the 
actual exercises. As you do the work you will find that your body 
starts to tremble or shake. The trembling can be very subtle, 
almost like quivering, or it can be larger trembling (often seen in 
the legs), or it can be spasms. Except for the types of spasm I 
mentioned in Part One where it might be corrected by doing the 
swimming kick exercise and/or by taking a magnesium & 
calcium supplement, there is no reason to be concerned with this 
quivering or trembling or spasms. Just keep breathing through 
these involuntary body movements. These body motions may 
seem strange, even inexplicable, to you but in fact they are a sign 
of progress. Welcome them. (See footnote 19. on page 116).

This work, like the breathing work, should not be done within 
three hours of eating. Give your stomach time to clear all the food 
before you do a session.

I have one more very important point to make before I 
describe the exercises. There is a kind of natural error that many, 
if not even most, people make in these exercises. They make the 
same error in the breathing part of the work that I discussed in 
Part One. The error could be described a number of different 
ways even though there is only one source of this error. The 
nature of the error is that people do not trust that they will do 
things correctly if they do not control everything. That is, they 
approach their own body with the assumption that they could not 
do something if they did not think it out, if they did not mentally 
control and command their own body. 

I mentioned this error in Part One. Now it is time that I made 
this issue a prominent one. One of the major reasons why people 
do their breathing in two phases (first an inhale and then an 
exhale) is that they think they have to think the sequence instead 
of simply getting the feel of what i t  is  l ike to breathe 
continuously and let it become an automatic, natural process. 
This becomes even more of an issue now that I add exercises on 
top of the breathing. Needing to exercise control, when they add 
another point of control, they find that they can not do both 



Chapter 10, Introduction to part two             179
because they can’t think both points of control at the same time. 
They can think the breath cycle or they can think the forehead 
movement (to pick one example) but they can’t think both at the 
same time. 

We are jumping way ahead of ourselves here but still it is not 
a bad place to make a point about the nature of this work. Recall 
from Part One that you are changing your nature with this 
Reichian work. Now a simple question will make the point: do 
you think your sexuality is something separate from your nature? 
If you answered: yes, you’re beyond this book; simply stop here 
and forget this work. For all the rest of you, what is an orgasm 
other than a letting go of control and giving into the automatic 
operation of your body? Answer: it is nothing else! 

What is sexual arousal other than letting the sensations from 
your body flood your whole consciousness? Same answer! The 
need to control is a part of one’s nature. To the extent you control 
and/or to the extent that you disown your body, to that extent you 
are preventing arousal and the full experience of the sexual 
experience in orgasm. I can promise you without any question 
that this work will have a profound effect on your sexual 
experience. It won’t happen quickly and it will be a gradual 
increase in intensity rather than a sudden change, but it will 
happen. 

This change will happen especially when you get to the work 
on the pelvis. But a note of caution. Don’t skip the eye work to 
get to the pelvis. However long it takes, first clear any chronic 
tension you have in the forehead and the eyes before you go on to 
other areas.24

24.Actually, in practice in a therapist’s office, there are a host of 
exceptions to this rule. It would simply complicate this book 
beyond endurance to deal with all these exceptions. Therefore, to 
make this book readable and usable, I have simply ignored all the 
exceptions. But I can mention that if Part One of this book is not 
clearing up the breathing, there are some exercises in Chapters 16, 
17, and 18 that can help. But, then again, that is not license to just 
do all the exercises in those three chapters before the breathing is 
even half right. As mentioned a number of time, it is better to be 
too slow in this work than it is to jump ahead and undertake exer-
cises for which your character is not ready.



180 Reichian technique, Part Two

One note of mea culpa before we enter Part Two of the book. 
In preparing this book for publication I noticed that almost 
without exception I had made a serious error in photography. I 
may or may not be a good therapist, but I am a bad photographer. 
The error is that I was so focused on getting the shot I wanted that 
I failed to notice that in almost all shots the model’s mouth is not 
sufficiently open. The mouth should, in all exercises, be wide 
open. 

As in Part One, there are major boxes:

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SAY IT, BUT I WILL 
ANYWAY. ALL THESE EXERCISES ARE DONE 
WITH THE PROPER BREATHING AS PRESENTED 
IN PART ONE!

CHAPTER 11

FOREHEAD AND EYES

 INTRODUCTION 

As with so many of these exercises, these seem simple and not 
exciting. That is not correct. Except for the breathing, you will 
get more personal benefit from freeing the forehead and eyes 
then from any other exercises. Don’t wait until the breathing 
work is mastered before beginning these exercises. The forehead 
and eye exercises may and should be done at any time before the 
breathing work is finished.

It is really amazing how much is held in the forehead and the 
eyes. Think about it this way. Suppose you were to draw a circle 
around your head at a level slightly below the eyes. Your circle 
would include your forehead, your eyes and your ears. That takes 
in two of our three distance senses. The only thing not included 
would be the nose and I will take care of that part separately later. 
It is with our eyes and our ears that we most take in the world. If

there is tension in these senses – if we have withdrawn from the 
world into ourselves – the life cost is immense. 

In both parts of this book I have, in general, not told you what 
to expect because I don’t want to give your subconscious the data 
with which to fake a response. And believe me, it will. Your 
subconscious is built to resist change. The more information it 
has, the more it has the means to resist the effects of this work. 
But here, the effects are so dramatic when they happen and are in 
general so difficult to fake, that I will break the rule here and tell 
you what will happen when you fully clear up any chronic 
tensions in the forehead and the eyes. 

It is rare that there is not some, and often a lot of, held tension 
in the forehead and/or the eyes. Thus while it is true that not 
everyone will experience these changes, it is so common that I 
am safe in saying that you will experience this change.

One change occurs in vision. If you have tension in your eye 
area, you don’t realize it but you don’t see depth and colors the 
same way someone without the tension sees them. The best way I 
can describe the difference is that a person with eye tension sees 
the world as though it were a color photograph. That is, the sense 
of depth is, as it were, flat and the colors are not as vibrant as they 
are in reality. Someone with held tension in the eyes can not 
know they have the tension, for that person the world simply 
looks the way the world has always looked. It is only when the 
chronic tension is broken and you see the world with a full sense 
of depth and vibrant colors that you realize that you have not 
been looking at the world that way before. The difference is 
dramatic, but it comes only when the tension in the eyes has been 
broken.

The other change is in hearing. The change here is less 
dramatic, but no less real. Your taste in music will change as will 

Changes that result from working on the forehead and eyes
1. change in color intensity
2. change in depth perception
3. change in taste in music
4. change in focus and concentration



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 183
the loudness at which you play music. The change is from the 
loud and hard rhythms of rock type music to softer and more 
melodic music. I can’t say for each of you what the change will 
be, whether it will be to crooning or classical or country; but it 
will change to a softer sound played with a lower volume. 

Just to cover the person whose subconscious sees this 
discussion of music as a way to escape these exercises, let me add 
that the person who already listens mostly to classical or opera or 
crooning music is not thereby free of this tension. You may have 
less of the tension, it may not have deadened your hearing, but it 
is only when you can fully do the eye exercises that you can be 
sure that this held tension has been dissolved.

Another common change is with people who are absent-
minded, tend to lose things, have more than their share of auto 
accidents. This tendency to be unfocused is mainly contained in 
forehead tension. As you clear the forehead and then the eyes 
your degree of focus and concentration will increase. As always, 
you will not be aware of this as if there were some switch thrown. 
Instead it will be a gradual, organic, change and you will likely 
only be aware of the change in looking back on yourself and the 
way you used to be.

FOREHEAD

 TONIC EYES OPEN

variant 1

On the inhale (Figure 71 on page 184) open your eyes and 
wrinkle the forehead as much as you can25. On the exhale let 
your eyes close. You should be able to do this exercise for ten 
minutes without stopping or losing your sequence of open and 
close.

25.If you have had Botox (tm) injections into your forehead muscles, 
then continue with the other eye exercises until the medication 
wears off. Then do the forehead exercises until you have freed the 
muscles. You can then go back to your Botox use.



184 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 71



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 185

variant 2

On both the inhale and exhale open your eyes and wrinkle the 
forehead. In variant 1 you relaxed after each inhale, here you 
keep the forehead constantly wrinkled. Again 10 minutes is a 
good time goal.

There are two things to notice in Figure 71. First note how 
much better the wrinkling is for the lower picture than in the 
upper picture. Both have good wrinkling, it is just better for the 
second model. Now this difference can be because the upper 
model has residual tension in his forehead muscle (the frontalis) 
but it can also be because he has a shorter forehead and thus his 
muscle is shorter. In your work shoot for the amount of wrinkling 
of model two, but keep in mind the issue of anatomical 
differences.

The other thing to note is that top model in Figure 71 has to 
open his eyes wide in order to get wrinkling of the forehead while 
model two has relaxed eyelids while still getting maximum 
forehead wrinkling. Model two is doing it correctly. It is not a 
critical issue that the two be separated, but still that is the goal. 
The muscle that wrinkles the forehead is completely different 
from the muscle that raises the eyelids. 

My Reichian therapist referred to this connection of two 
different muscles such that both had to be used to accomplish a 
movement as the muscles being “fused.” It is not a bad term to 
use. Our goal is to unfuse muscle groups. We will see this 
phenomena again when I talk about the jaw. We have already 
seen a variant of this fusing when I discussed the breathing and 
how some people need to use the accessory muscles of 
respiration to fully inhale.

For some it can take many months of repetitions of this 
exercise to separate these two actions, but that is the proper goal.

 TONIC EYES CLOSED

variant 1



186 Reichian technique, Part Two

On the inhale open the eyes normally. On the exhale squeeze 
the eyes shut as tightly as you can. This is just like variant 1 of 
the tonic eyes open. You alternate between relaxing (inhale) and 
tensing (exhale). For good reason, the breath cycle during which 
you tense or relax is opposite between tonic eyes open and tonic 
eyes closed. In tonic open you tensed during the inhale in tonic 
closed you tense during the exhale.

Figure 72



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 187

variant 2

On both the inhale and exhale keep your eyes squeezed shut as 
tightly as possible. As with the wrinkling, many people are able 
to squeeze well for a few breaths but they can not hold it. As 
usual, 10 minutes is a good goal point.

Again in Figure 72, as in Figure 71, we can see the difference 
in the two models. The upper picture shows that he is unable to 
squeeze his eyes shut, he can only just close them. In the lower 
picture we see a good squeezing shut. 

Taking the two figures together (Figure 71 and Figure 72) we 
can see that the top model was unable to fully wrinkle his 
forehead and he is unable to fully squeeze his eyes shut. The 
second figure confirms the impression of the first figure. The top 
model has what Reich termed “armor” in his forehead and it 
needs work.

USE OF A MIRROR

When first doing this exercise it is best to use a hand mirror so 
that you can see whether you are fully wrinkling the forehead. 

Figure 73

There are two common errors in these two eye exercises. One 
is not wrinkling the forehead. You may wrinkle for a few 
minutes, but then the forehead tires and you no longer get the 



188 Reichian technique, Part Two

wrinkling. The other common error is to not close the eyes 
tightly. The eyes are closed but they are not pressed tightly.  

If you cannot do the wrinkling or if your forehead has 
permanent wrinkles, you can use pressure on your forehead to 
make the muscles sore (Figure 74). Using one hand, put your 
thumb and first two fingers above the nose and, while pressing 
hard, move your fingers apart and together. Then move up the 
forehead. You can get the muscle in the middle of your forehead 
by using your thumb.

Figure 74

The purpose of pressure, to repeat what I said in Part One of 
this book, is to make the muscle sore. The reason for this is 
straight physiology and neurology. The body responds to 
soreness in a muscle by not tensing it as much. For a day or two 
until the soreness passes, the muscle does not hold its normal 
level of tension. The subconscious responds to this change of 
body state and attempts to adjust to the change during the dream 
cycle. The gradual change in character follows.

Where there are permanent wrinkles in the forehead (that is, 
not just lines, but permanent wrinkles) then we have a condition 
of constant tension. When a muscle is sore, the way the body 
naturally operates is to let the muscle relax. It is just as if you 
over exercised and have sore muscles. 



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 189
You will naturally favor those muscles since use of them is 
painful. By using pressure you make the muscle sore and it then, 
for a day or two, relaxes thus defeating the “armor.”26

Where there is the inability to wrinkle the forehead or tightly 
shut the eyes, we have an opposite kind of tension. Here the word 
‘tension’ is used in a broader sense. In constant wrinkles the 
nerve to the muscle is overactive and thus the constant wrinkling 
while in the case that you can not wrinkle it is because your brain 
is not able to locate that muscle and thus cannot control it. The 
pressure then for a few days allows your brain to locate that 
muscle and, in effect, to rewire the connection of the brain to the 
muscle. Both cases represent Reichian “armor,” just a different 
manifestation (the four types of “armor” are given on page 48).

EYES

In addition to just working on the forehead, you want to work 
on the eyes. There are many more exercises for the eyes than for 
the forehead. 

You can work on the eye area at the same time you are 
working on the forehead. Both should be substantially cleared 
before you go on to other areas. You should work on this group 
before you finish with the breath work

EYES OPEN AND CLOSE

26.The term “armor” is a pictorially apt term. It paints a good mental 
picture. Unfortunately, as with most of Reich’s terms, he so mis-
used it over time – constantly changing the definition without 
changing the underlying concept – that it is now an undefinable 
and thus unusable term. That is why I put it in quote marks.

Eyes open and close
Eyes in directions
Roll the eyes
Bug eyes, skull eyes
Express feelings in the eyes



190 Reichian technique, Part Two

On the inhale open your eyes as widely as possible and 
wrinkle the forehead. On the exhale close your eyes as tightly as 
possible. 

This is like the previous tonic eyes open and tonic eyes closed 
where we were working on the forehead but here we do want the 
eyes to open wide as the forehead is wrinkled. Previously we 
were working on breaking any fusing (if present as for the model 
in Figure 71 on page 184) but now, with the linking either broken 
or being worked on, we want to see if the two actions can be 
combined. 

Shortly we will have an exercise where only the eyes open 
without the forehead being employed.

EYES IN DIRECTIONS 

For a full breath (inhale and exhale) put your eyes (eyes only, 
do not move your head) as far as you can to the left, down, right, 
up, and continue. The center is not a direction. So for a full breath 
you are looking as far as you can to the left. For the next full 
breath you are looking down as far as you can down. Then right 
and then up, each for a full breath. If you find that your eyes are 
coming to the center that only means you have more work to do 
on this exercise.

When doing this exercise do not move your head, only your 
eyes. When looking up, the forehead should not wrinkle. This is 
another issue of unfusing two completely unrelated muscles. The 
muscles that move the eyes are unrelated to the muscle that 
wrinkles the forehead. This exercise involves only the eyes and 
not any other muscles. It is a common problem that the eyes are 
not separated from the forehead, that is it is common that people 
have difficulty looking up (as though you were trying to look 
through two holes in the top of your head) without also tensing 
the forehead muscles. Movement of the eyes is anatomically 
completely different from movement of the forehead or the 
eyebrows. If you have difficulty looking up without also tensing 
your forehead, it only means you have more work to do here.

This exercise is, surprisingly, one of the most important in all 
of the Reichian work. In emphasizing the importance of this 
exercise, I am not endorsing Reich’s eyes to pelvis segment 



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 191
theory — that theory has no empirical or theoretical validity. I am 
basing my emphasis both on the literature of the expressive 
content of the eyes and forehead and on my 35 years of practice 
as a Reichian therapist. This is a book on practice, not theory, so I 
will forego until a later more technical book on Reichian therapy 
to explain why mastery of this exercise (and the following one on 
Roll the Eyes) is so important, so essential.

In Figure 75 you can see that this model, the same one who 
had trouble with tonic eyes open and tonic eyes closed for the 
forehead, is also unable to move his eyes without also moving his 
head. Looking at the top row of photographs, when he moves his 
eyes from eyes right to eyes down he lifts his head. In the bottom 
row of photographs note how when he does eyes left he turns his 
head to the left and when he does eyes up he again lifts his head. 
An error by the photographer was not to have the model’s mouth 
properly open during the exercise. 

Figure 75

I say again,  don’t  rush this  work.  ALWAYS TOO 
SLOWLY. I have seen a range of people complete the forehead 



192 Reichian technique, Part Two

and eye work. Some finish in just a few weeks while others take 
several years and everything in between. As long as it takes for 
you, that is how long you should be willing to give it. It is not a 
race. It is not a contest. Everyone has his own speed and it is 
wisdom to respect your own speed, your own body and nature, 
and not have some arbitrary demand that you be able to finish 
quickly. 

You may find that this eyes in directions exercise produces 
some fear. Don’t push beyond your tolerance. If there is fear and 
it is too strong, simply stop the exercise for this session. There is 
always the next session and the next session and the next session.

If you are not sure whether you are wrinkling the forehead 
when you do eyes up, you can place your fingers on your 
forehead to see if it moves. 

ROLL THE EYES 

While you continue to breathe, roll the eyes to all four 
directions (up, right, down, left). If you start clockwise then 
switch after about five minute to counter clockwise and, of 
course, the opposite too. Keep your breathing going. 

You may have to start this exercise with very slow rolls. It is 
harder to do then it would seem. When you can do the exercise 
smoothly and for about 10 minutes (5 in each direction), then 
start to speed up. The rate of rotation is not tied to the breathing. 
Irrespective of the rotation rate, the breathing continues at the 
normal approximately 12 breaths per minute.

This is like the previous “eyes in directions” exercise except 
that there is no pause. It is kind of an advanced eyes in directions. 
In the eyes in directions exercise each direction involved a 
complete breath but here the breathing and the eyes are not 
connected. The breathing continues on while the eyes are rolled. 

Don’t try for speed right away. Most people when they try for 
speed simply reduce the distance that the eyes move, they no 
longer get the full directionality of up, left, down, right. 

Here is where the ability to let go of control of the breathing 
and focus on something else really shows up. If you have really 
freed your belly and chest and reached the point where the full 
deep belly-chest breathing is habituated, then this will present no 



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 193
problems. But if you are still not willing to let your body take 
over and simply feel the rhythm of the breath, then this exercise 
will really show up that issue.

When you get really good at the breathing and your eyes are 
really free you will find that you no longer have to concentrate on 
the rolling of the eyes. You simply start them rolling and it is as 
though they continue on their own from there. But it is not easy 
to get to that point. It is actually a good idea, once you get to this 
point, to start each session with first some breathing and then 
follow that with a few minutes of roll the eyes before you go to 
any other exercise in this book. 

EXPRESS FEELINGS IN THE EYES 

This is part of your daily work but here I am adding the 
breathing which makes the exercise much more powerful. 

It is OK if the sound (the ‘ah’ sound) changes during this 
exercise. Sometimes, as for example with anger, some other 
sound feels, or seems to be, more appropriate. In a latter exercise 
in this book I will add the facial expression to this exercise, but 
here it is only with the eyes. 

Don’t think that because later I will add the face that therefore 
there is no special value in expressing feelings only with your 
eyes. Think of actors and actresses in movies. Think how often 
there is a tight shot with only the eyes showing and expressing 
the feelings of the actor in just the eyes. The eyes are very 
expressive.

While you can choose any emotion or set of emotions you 
want to express, here is the list of the most important ones:

Fear
Anger
Longing
Sadness
Tenderness
Concern (empathy)
Liking
Disinterest



194 Reichian technique, Part Two

pity
disdain

Don’t slight an emotion. That is, don’t just make a half 
hearted effort to express the emotion in your eyes and pass 
quickly onto the next one. Give each emotion as much intensity 
as you can. 

Don’t worry about the breathing. It is reasonable that your 
breathing in fear would be different from anger and both different 
from tenderness. Just immerse yourself in the emotion and let 
your breathing change in whatever way it happens to go. Let go 
of control and get as fully involved in the emotion as you can. 

As always, if something is too strong then stay with it only as 
long as you can. There is always another session. Even if it takes 
many months to get back to the intensity of an emotion that you 
were expressing in one session, that is fine. The emotion is still 
there and when your system is ready for it to become intense 
again, it will happen. 

BUG EYES, SKULL EYES 

Before I even describe this exercise, a word of caution. I could 
have put this exercise in a separate section labeled “advanced 
exercises” but I wanted to keep all the exercises for each area 
together. This exercise is advanced for two reasons: (1) if you 
start to do this eye exercise before you have fully freed your eyes, 
you will cause the eyes to tense instead of relax; that is you will 
increase the tension instead of releasing it and (2) this exercise 
can have rather profound effects on your dreams.

You might recall that in Part One I mentioned that most of the 
change in your nature will occur in your dreams. Now some 
people do not remember their dreams at all and other people 
remember their dreams so well that they keep a dream journal. 
The point of this is that we are all accustomed to our own dreams 
and when they change it can leave us disoriented or preoccupied, 
unable to concentrate properly. As you worked on the breathing, 
freeing up the chest, the belly and the diaphragm you might 
already have experienced this effect so you know what I mean. 



Chapter 11, Forehead and eyes                 195
But this exercise is the first of a number that I will present here in 
Part Two that will have a more significant effect on your dreams. 

Forewarned is forearmed, so here is the exercise.

On the inhale try to protrude your eyes, like a bug with big 
eyes sticking out. On the exhale try to retract your eyes as though 
your head were a skull. Neither the breathing nor the sound 
changes.

Sounds easy, doesn’t it? When you are ready for this exercise 
then you will find out how difficult it is and the profound effects 
it can have.

I would like to show you pictures, but even if our models 
could do this exercise without preparation the difference between 
the bug eyes and the skull eyes would not show up in pictures.

This exercise should not be done for more than a few minutes 
until you have done it over several sessions and until any upset in 
either you mood or your dreams has passed. Then it can be done 
for a longer time, but, as usual, not over 15 minutes.



196 Reichian technique, Part Two



Chapter 12, Face                            197

CHAPTER 12

THE FACE

There are seven face exercises and they are very important. 
Research shows that the face is the most emotionally expressive 
set of muscles in the whole body. You may do the face exercises 
before you have finished the breathing work in Part One of this 
book.

Your face, more than any other part of the body, displays your 
personality. The importance of the face runs both ways. That is, 
your personality is reflected in your face and your face effects 
your personality (as well as your place in many social situations). 
A face can, in non-verbal language, say you are open or 
unavailable; say your are angry, happy or sad; say you are 
friendly or hostile; etc. 

Currently, we have a model in the actor, Jim Carry, whose 
career is based in large part on the motility of his face. Movie and 
television actors, in close-up shots, portray the essence of their 
character by their face. 

 MOVE THE FACE SLOWLY 

Move the face slowly
Smile inhale, frown exhale
Blow through the lips
Shit on a stick
Put exhale
Spread the nostrils
The mirror look



198 Reichian technique, Part Two

This face exercise is part of your daily routine. But it has more 
effect when done with the breathing. Simply because you have 
made this exercise part of your morning routine does not mean 
that it should not also be part of your work sessions. 

Like all exercises, this exercise is done with the breathing. The 
essential issue with this exercise is that the face is moved slowly
from one position to another in fluid motion, not jerky. The 
breathing should not change and the sound is still the same soft 
‘ah’ sound. 

There are, in most people, 22 muscles in the face (we are all 
unique and thus there can be fewer muscles in some people). 
Take note that we are interested in the face muscles, not the 
muscles that move the jaw. This does not mean that the jaw does 
not move, it only means that you should concentrate on the 
muscles of the face and not be taken in by jaw movement in place 
of facial muscle tension and relaxation. 

Just to give you some idea, the mouth can smile, pout, or 
frown. The lips can open to ‘bare the teeth’ or they can purse. 
The tip of the chin can be tense or relaxed. The eyebrow can be 
raised on one side, the other side, both, just in the center above 
the nose, just at the outer corner. The corner of the mouth can be 
drawn back on one side, the other side, or both. And so it goes. 
As with all exercises, keep trying to improve your performance, 
that is, keep trying to use more of the 22 muscles in your face.

This is as good a time as any to repeat some of the discussion 
of the ‘ah’ sound. This is a very soft sound. It is not articulated. 
That is, rather than the sound being made to be followed by the 
exhale, the sound is simply inserted into the stream of air of the 
exhale as I hope you can hear on the audio. True, the ‘ah’ sound 
is made at the beginning of the exhale, but still the soft sound is 
not the start of the exhale, it simply occurs at the same time. 
Reich, aptly, described the sound as like the sound of a sigh. 



Chapter 12, Face                            199

SMILE INHALE, FROWN EXHALE 

On the inhale draw the corners of your mouth up as though in 
a smile. Note that this refers to the corner of the mouth, not the 
jaw or a full smile. The exercise is to draw the corners of the 
mouth up. If you smile with your whole face you are not doing 
the exercise properly.

On the exhale draw the corners of your mouth down as though 
to frown.



200 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 77

Notice in the above figure that our model is smiling with his 
whole face rather than just with the corners of his mouth. That is 
technically not correct, but the frown is a good start. Note also 
that his eyes are almost unchanged from the smile to the frown. 
That is correct. This exercise uses only the corners of the mouth 
coordinated with the breathing.

BLOW THROUGH LIPS 

On the exhale, put your lips together and blow through your 
lips. The lips are not tight. They should vibrate like a baby’s, 
making a kind of motorboat sound. This exercise can be done 
while you are learning the breathing.

In order to do this exercise properly you have to be able to 
fully relax your lips. If you find that the sound is hard to start or 
that it stops during the exhale, then you still have unneeded 
tension in your lips. In Reich’s terms, your mouth is still 
“armored.”



Chapter 12, Face                            201

Figure 78

SHIT ON A STICK 27 

On the inhale, wrinkle your nose as if you are smelling 
something very bad. On the exhale let your nose muscles relax. It 
is best to do this exercise with a mirror as it is (1) easy to wrinkle 
between the eyes (the so-called frown lines) and think you are 
wrinkling the nose and (2) many people cannot locate this muscle 
and thus cannot tell whether it is or is not being wrinkled. Using a 
mirror can answer these questions.

This exercise sounds very simple and, as far as the issue is use 
of the muscle, it is simple once you can locate and tense the 
muscle. However, this exercise is one of those that has a simple 
description and a simple execution but its effects are profound. 
This exercise should not be done while you are still learning the 
breathing. Please believe me, this is a powerful exercise and you 
should hold off on doing it till you have made good progress on 
the breathing.

Figure 79 on page 202 shows wrinkling, but it is not being 
done correctly. Look first at the figure and see if you can guess 
the error. Don’t read the next sentence until you examine Figure 
79 and see if you can spot the problem.

27.  This exercise was named by Francis Regardie. To honor him, the 
name is retained.



202 Reichian technique, Part Two

The error is that he gets the wrinkling by squeezing his eyes 
shut. That is another example of fused muscles. He has the “bad 
smell” muscle at the top of the nose linked to the muscle that 
closes the eyes. 

Figure 79

 POUT EXALE

Mouth is open during the inhale; mouth is closed into a pout 
during the exhale. The lip placement during a pout is very similar 
to the lip placement during the blow through the lips exercise. 
The difference is that in the blow through the lips the lips are 
relaxed so that they can vibrate. In a pout the lips are tensed so 
that even though the air is exiting through the mouth, the lips do 
not vibrate. An example is shown in Figure 80.

If you can do it, you can let yourself feel like a young child 
when you pout.



Chapter 12, Face                            203

Figure 80

 SPREAD THE NOSTRILS 

You may well not know it, but there actually are muscles 
which can expand (dilate) the nostrils. On the inhale dilate your 
nostrils, on the exhale let them relax. Again I recommend the use 
of a mirror to be able to see whether you are or are not actually 
making the motion.

Figure 81

It is difficult to see the difference in the two photos in Figure 
81, but the nostril openings on the left actually measure 25% 
wider than on the right.



204 Reichian technique, Part Two

Note the absence of fusing. Where in Figure 79 our model had 
to squeeze his eyes shut in order to produce wrinkling in the nose, 
here there is no noticeable change in the model’s face from the 
left panel to the right panel.

THE MIRROR LOOK

This is actually one of the most interesting of all the exercises 
in terms of what it can produce; but its utility is very dependent 
on your ability to relax to and allow the experience. Don’t be 
concerned if for some time you don’t seem to be getting anything 
from this exercise. It is very dependent on your ability to let go of 
control. I discussed control back in Part One, Chapter five 
starting on page 114. This might be a good time to reread those 
few pages.

This exercise needs a hand mirror that you use to look at your 
own face. It is similar to the daily exercise of using a mirror, but 
it is much more advanced and thus, potentially, more powerful.

Holding the mirror well above your face so that you can see 
your whole face, attempt to create emotion in your face. 

There are two parts to this. In the first part you want to look at 
how well you are actually manifesting the emotion you are 
attempting to create In the second part you want to respond to 
your own mirror emotion. Now that takes a bit more discussion.

To just coldly, as it were, make your face look as it would if 
the given emotion were present, is to actually distance yourself 
from the experience. Let’s take fear as an example. To just open 
your eyes wide as though in a fearful state would be noting more 
than the simple fact of opening your eyes wide. It would be the 
face of fear, but not the emotion of fear. As you make the face of 
any given emotion you want to try to create that emotion not just 
in your face but as well throughout your whole body. 

That relates to part one and I will return to it shortly, but let’s 
first look at part two.

Here you are responding to your own created (or emulated) 
emotion. Continuing with fear: looking at that fearful face what is 
your response to it. Just as some examples, you might respond to 
your own fear with disapproval or determination (to surmount) or 



Chapter 12, Face                            205
with cowardice or with boredom or with any number of other 
emotions and feelings.

This calls up the point I made about the nature of emotion. 
Here you are attempting to create an emotion (of fear) but what is 
your attitude, your opinion, of fear. That attitude will, in turn, 
produce other emotions. Emotion as a response to emotion? Yes. 
To a cognitive mind, emotion is just like any other experience 
(physical or mental) and it is evaluated by your mind and results 
in yet other ideas and emotions.

Before continuing let me state yet again that NEVER PUSH 
THIS OR ANY EXERCISE BEYOND YOUR LIMITS.
Anything that comes up is part of you, it will still be there in the 
future. If you push too hard, just like exercising too hard, you will 
occasion damage not improvement. How old are you: twenty, 
thirty, forty, more? It has taken you all those years to become 
what you are now, you are not going to correct it in a few months 
or even in a few years.  The motto is:  ALWAYS TOO 
SLOWLY.

Returning now to part one and combining it with part two, you 
are going to try to create an emotional state in yourself as 
expressed in your face and, based on that state, you are then 
going to observe your own reaction to your own created emotion. 
Don’t expect to be good at this immediately. In fact it is better if 
you are not that good at it at first. If you get too deeply into this 
exercise the first time or even the first 20 times, the result is 
likely to be trauma. That trauma can prevent you from then 
getting nearly as deep ever again.

I want to emphasize that while I have used fear as the 
example, there are over 550 named emotions in the English 
language. Making a face of mirth or ridicule or disdain or anger 
or longing or sadness or any of the other over 550 emotions is 
completely valid in this exercise. In fact the more you vary the 
emotions you try to create and react to (from the mirror), the 
better this exercise will work.

CHAPTER 13

THE JAW

INTRODUCTION

The chapter on the jaw needs an introduction because we are 
about to enter a whole new area and issue. I previously referred to 
the discussion in Chapter five on control and suggested that it 
might be worth while to reread that section (starting on page 
114). Now I am going to discuss the other side of control, the side 
called defenses. Defenses in body-based psychotherapy take on a 
very different character from the form they take in verbal 
therapy. But their objective is the same: they protect the 
psychological system from change which is to say they protect it 
from being challenged.

The issue of defenses will be address again in Chapter 23, but 
there from a formal point of view because Chapter 23 addresses

the cognitive work that must (or at least, should) accompany the 
body work.

But even before I leap into the discussion of the form the 
defenses take in body-based psychotherapy, I have to discuss 
why defenses are present. There are a number of ways to present 
this issue. I will approach it, given the nature of the topic (body 
psychotherapy), from the point of view of the nature of the 
subconscious. Once you understand what defenses are and why 
they are present (in everyone), then I can turn to the form the 
defenses take in Reichian therapy. Then, finally, I can explain 
why I am raising this issue at this time, in the chapter on the jaw.

I would like to start with a quote from Reich. There is not 
much in Reich’s writing that has stood up over time, but 
occasionally he has a jewel. Here is one such:

“If defenses were not necessary 
they would not be present.”

Yes, necessary; but why? Can’t we live without defenses? 
Freud wrestled with that problem and came out with the book 
Civilization and its discontents. Reich wrestled with the problem 
and came out with a rehash of Engels’ theory of matriarchy 
mixed with Rousseauian uptopianism. Rollo May wrestled with 
the problem and came out with anxiety. Sartre wrestled and came 
out with fear of death. Kohut answered with narcissistic injury. 
Bowlby answered with abandonment fear. Jacobson answered 
with depression. Each theorist has wrestled with the issue, some 
directly, some obliquely; but all agree that defenses are 
necessary. 

I am not much of a wrestler so I will settle on the simple 
answer that defenses are needed in service of homeostasis. 

And what, pray tell, is homeostasis? Homeo- is the prefix for 
same. -stasis is the suffix for state. Put together they say that 
humans, by nature, try not to change; they try to maintain a 
constant or same state. Now before you jump all over me with 
examples of major dieting or major exercise workouts to tone the 
body or major plastic surgery to change ones appearance, let me 
explain how homeostasis works in the body but more important 
in the mind.



Chapter 13, Jaw                            209
In the body, absent severe disease or deliberate tinkering (like 

getting drunk), the body maintains all its components at a 
constant state. Simple proof is presented by the fact of blood and 
urine tests. If there were not constants in the body then blood or 
urine tests would never be done. These tests all count on their 
being a normal range of values and that a deviation — too high or 
too low — indicates disease.

Now the subconscious also is homeostatic. It doesn’t like 
change. When the subconsciousness’ well worked out stability, 
its homeostasis, is challenged it fights back both with defense 
mechanisms and with anxiety. The anxiety is a signal that the 
subconscious finds its stability threatened (Freud, for somewhat 
different reasons, properly termed this “signal anxiety.”)

If you’ll accept my premise that the subconscious is a 
homeostatic mechanism, then we have an explanation of 
something I said much earlier. I noted that the great majority of 
the changes produced by this therapy occur in the dream. The 
reason for this is  that  dreams are the method that  the 
subconscious uses to rid itself of conflict. A dream is a self-
written internal novel (more an allegory) in which the various 
conflicting ideas or experiences of the subconscious are 
attempted to be harmonized — it is attempting to remove the 
conflict which disturb its homeostasis. The therapy disturbs that 
homeostasis (the body is no less a part of the subconscious than is 
our past experience, thinking, and emotion) and the subconscious 
responds to the disturbance by way of the dreams.

You are probably familiar with defenses in everyday life and 
in conversation. So many of these defenses have entered our 
language as normal terms of use that most people have lost track 
of the origin of the words: projection, denial, identification, etc. 
In all there are over 40 well-recognized defenses. In what might 
almost be a part three to this book, I will discuss the cognitive 
part of self-therapy including a discussion of cognitive defenses 
(actually, coping mechanisms rather than defenses) in Chapter 
23. 

We don’t defended only with thoughts and words, we also 
defend with the body. Reichian therapy breaks up that body 
stability, that body homeostasis, and the subconscious attempts to 
deal with the conflict, it attempts to reestablish homeostasis.



210 Reichian technique, Part Two

If there are over 40 defense mechanisms in use verbally, there 
are also a bunch in use in the body. Of all the body defenses, 
however, there are four biggies. 

First, there are various tricks of breathing (like breathing in 
two phases, first an inhale followed by an exhale) or keeping the 
breathing slow and shallow to avoid the hyperventilation we 
looked at in Part One of this book.

But there are another three common ones that relate to the jaw 
so this is as good a time as any to lay them out first before we get 
to the jaw exercises.

I see these so commonly that it almost possible to say that 
everyone uses these defenses.

The first involves keeping the mouth relatively closed. I will 
show you shortly in photographs how the mouth is supposed to 
be open  but likely you will learn to do this only if you make, at 
the start, a conscious habit to keep the mouth open.

The second involves opening and closing the mouth with each 
breath. The mouth is opened (slightly) on the inhale and closed 
(not fully) on the exhale. 

The third involves moving the tongue with each breath. 
Usually the tongue is moved forward with the inhale and pulled 
back with the exhale (however, I have seen the opposite pattern).

There are other, less common, body defenses that you should 
watch for in your work. This list is not exhaustive. People are 
tricky animals. But here are the more common ones: closing your 
eyes (other than when the exercises calls for it), excessive 
yawning, stopping to talk (to your helper), thinking about other 
things in order to mentally leave the session, unnecessary hand or 
arm or leg movement.

On the whole, I don’t like patient stories, but this does call for 
one. This person was referred to me by his first Reichian therapist 
who was retiring. He had been in therapy for seven years with 
that therapist. I could not see that he had benefited at all from that 
therapy, but then I didn’t know where he had started. It was only 
that I would have expected more progress after seven years. Still, 
we got to work. I started with eye work. He needed that. But then 
one, two, three and into four years went by and he was not 
making the progress he should be making. Why? Then, just 
luckily, I spotted it. I happened to be standing over him at the 



Chapter 13, Jaw                            211
head end of the bed and I saw that every time he exhaled he 
pulled his tongue back. I corrected that by the simple instruction 
to him to put his tongue against the back of his teeth and leave it 
there. Then progress started. Today he is a different person. 

He had not made progress before because he was — 
unrecognized by him, by his former therapist, or by me up to that 
point — using a simple body defense against the therapy.

MEDICAL NOTE

Repeating what I said in Chapter one (on page 30) the jaw 
joint that allows the mouth to open and move side to side for 
chewing is a very small and therefore fragile joint. You should 
either abort or not do at all any exercise that produces any pain or 
even discomfort in your jaw joint. The joint is located about 1/2 
inch forward from your ear. If you place your hand on the side of 
your face and then open and close your mouth you will be able to 
feel where this joint is located. These exercises will produce 
pulling in the muscles of the jaw, but that is not the same as strain 
on the jaw joint. 

I repeat, if you have even a suspicion that you are stressing the 
jaw joint in any of these exercises, then don’t do that particular 
exercise or perhaps even any of the exercises in this chapter. Let 
me put it this way: if you injure that joint you can have pain with 
every single bite of food. No Reichian work is worth that 
consequence.

OK, enough of that, lets get to the jaw exercises.

There are seven exercises with the jaw. As always, these are 
done with the breathing. These exercises may be done before you 
have finished with the breathing work.

JAW LEFT 

Move your jaw as far as possible to the left. Keep trying to 
move it further. Don’t clench your teeth, the mouth should be 



212 Reichian technique, Part Two

open enough that you can inset two fingers between your teeth. If 
there is a problem with your jaw joint, don’t do the exercise. 
Hold this position for about three minutes. 

Figure 82

The left photograph in Figure 82 shows proper execution of 
the jaw left exercise with the mouth open to the extent that the 
model can inset two fingers into his mouth while it is still pushed 
to the left. What is not apparent in the photographs is that this 
model still needs a lot of work in being fully able to move his jaw 
to the left.

JAW RIGHT 

Move your jaw as far as possible to the right. Keep trying to 
move it further. Don’t clench your teeth, the mouth should be 
open enough that you can inset two fingers between your teeth. If 
there is a problem with your jaw joint, don’t do the exercise. 
Hold this position for about three minutes.

Note in Figure 83 on the next page the our model’s mouth is 
not properly open.



Chapter 13, Jaw                            213

Figure 83

JAW BACK 

Figure 84

This is the most difficult of the set. The jaw is pulled back 
toward the ears. You may want a helper here. I discuss using a 
helper in Chapter 22. As with all the exercises, the idea is to 
break the muscle tension pattern. You are not trying to strain the 
jaw joint. If this exercise produces pain in your jaw joint (not in 
the muscles, but in the joint) then simply skip it. 

What is not shown in Figure 84 is that the standard of 
performance for the jaw back exercise is that you should be able 
to put a finger against your lower lip pointing upward and it 
should be completely behind the upper teeth.

JAW OUT



214 Reichian technique, Part Two

Push your jaw out (that is, protrude it) as far as possible and 
hold it. Don’t clench your teeth. Keep your breathing going 
properly.

Keep trying to push your jaw further out. As always, if you 
have a problem with your jaw joint, don’t do the exercise. Try to 
hold this position for about five minutes.

Neither of the models shown in Figure 85 provides a good 
photograph of what jaw out looks like because neither model was 
able to accomplish this exercise; they both need work on their 
jaw holding or “armor.”

Figure 85

MOUTH OPEN 

Open you mouth as wide as possible and hold it. Keep trying 
to open it further. This exercise is often the most painful (in the 
muscles). That is OK. Just keep working at it. Keep your 
breathing going properly. There is a strong tendency to let the 
mouth relax (and close a bit). Resist that tendency. If you are 
doing this exercise properly you will find a small muscle 
standing out at the side of your neck. See the arrow in the left 
panel of Figure 86 below. You can feel for this muscle while you 
do the exercise. Feeling for this muscle is a good way to provide 
feedback as to whether you are making the maximum effort to 
open your mouth.



Chapter 13, Jaw                            215

Figure 86

CLENCH TEETH 

This exercise requires a folded towel. A hand towel is OK but 
a bath towel is better. Fold a towel in four. Insert a corner of the 
towel into you mouth and bite as hard as you can on the towel. 
The sound changes to a growl sound. It is not quite the same 
growl as in Part One on page 111 since with the teeth clenched it 
is not really possible to have the same open throated sound as in 
the true growl sound. 

Figure 87

You can also toss your head while doing this. The towel-in-
the-mouth growl sound may be heard on the “sounds of Reichian 
therapy” audio that accompanies this book. The growl sound in 
this exercise is more like that of a growling dog. 



216 Reichian technique, Part Two

You may have heard of “biting anger.” This exercise is 
designed to bring that out. Thus while doing this exercise you can 
think of someone or something you hate and would like to 
destroy. 

PRESSURE

As with the forehead where the worker can use pressure on 
himself (see the discussion related to Figure 74 on page 188), the 
worker can also use pressure on himself for the jaw muscles. As I 
mentioned when discussing the forehead muscle pressure, the 
idea is to use enough pressure for enough time to make the 
muscles mildly sore to the touch. Keep doing this day after day to 
maintain that level of mild soreness. While there is a series of 
muscles related to the jaw movement, we will talk about only two 
of them. These are the two muscles that are easily felt at the side 
of the mouth area (the masseter and the buccinator). 

First, how can you tell if you have excess tension. Well, one 
way will be obvious at this point: you can not do the jaw 
exercises that well. Either you can not get the movement, or can 
not hold it for long, or it is quite painful. Another way is 
noticeable tension.

‘Noticeable’ tension comes in two easy to recognize forms. 
One is grinding your teeth at night. If you do that, you have 
excess jaw tension. Here is the other way. As you read this 
sentence take notice of your jaw position and do not let it move, 
even to answer a question. Now, if your jaw is relaxed you 
should -- without any jaw movement from the previous sentence 
-- be able to stick your first finger into your mouth without hitting 
your teeth. If you have to move your jaw to allow the finger 
insertion or if you finger is blocked by your teeth, then you have 
excess jaw tension.

Figure 142 on page 327 is a photograph of a helper putting 
pressure on the jaw muscles. As the worker, you will use your 
thumb for the pressure. You can, of course, put pressure on both 
sides of the jaw at the same time but I think you will find that it is 
easier on yourself if you do one side at a time. 



Chapter 13, Jaw                            217
It is not worth an anatomy lesson to distinguish between the 

buccinator muscle and the masseter muscle. They are both 
located at the side of the jaw with the masseter being bigger and 
thicker, while the buccinator is more toward the surface and 
nearer to the mouth. 

It is necessary at this point to once again say that we are not 
seeking pain. This therapy is not an endurance contest, it is not a 
chance to show how much you can endure or withstand, it is not 
an excuse for self-punishment. You should use moderate pressure 
and only as strong as will allow you to hold the pressure for 
perhaps five minutes at any one point. If the pressure you start 
with becomes too strong after a short time, simply lighten up but 
stay at that spot. 

As a rule of thumb (puns are fun occasionally) you are going 
to apply pressure to three places on each side of the jaw. That 
translates to about 1/2 hour of time for the pressure.  Each day 
thereafter you are going to test each spot to see if it is sore. If it is, 
leave it to the next day. If it is not, apply pressure there; again 
moderate for about five minutes. The pressure can be done at any 
time (except while driving): part of a morning routine, at your 
desk, at lunch, while reading or watching television in the 
evening. Just try to keep those muscles sore for enough weeks 
that your dreams have time to work on the issue and you now 
pass the jaw tension tests (no grinding at night, finger goes in 
easily). 

Now, as to the direction of the pressure. When your thumb is 
in the middle of your cheek, the direction of your pressure should 
be up. As your thumb moves backward toward the jaw joint, the 
direction of pressure becomes progressively more side to side. 
Try this. Right now, place a thumb in the middle of your jaw 
pointing straight up. Your thumb should be placed so that the 
knuckle of the thumb is at the corner of your mouth. Now, 
without moving your thumb, move your arm out so that it is at 
right angles to your body. That is exactly the motion that you will 
be making as you move from the middle of the jaw to the top or 
back of the jaw. That is the motion to change from an upward 
thrust to a side-to-side thrust. You don’t in fact have to do this 
motion with your arm; just rotating your hand will do the same 



218 Reichian technique, Part Two

thing. The issue is the direction of thrust, not how you get that 
direction.



Chapter 14, Tongue                          219

CHAPTER 14

THE TONGUE

We have now reached the point where you should have made 
good progress on the breathing before you do the exercises here. 
Getting all the breathing down properly can take a very long time 
so I am not saying that you should have completed your 
breathing work before you try these and the following exercises, 
rather I am saying that you should have made some real progress 
on the breathing before you start doing these exercises.

As I  have said disgustingly often,  ALWAYS TOO 
SLOWLY. Trying to rush into advanced exercises before you 
have fully or mostly freed the chest, the diaphragm and the belly 
can result in regression instead of progress. Here is a way to tell if 
you are trying these exercises too soon.

I am talking here about the tongue, but these exercises have a 
major effect on the throat. Because of this connection, most 
people have great difficulty keeping the soft ‘ah’ sound when 
they do these tongue exercises. 

Try it yourself. But don’t get taken in by your subconscious’s 
attempts to fake progress. If you find that you have to concentrate 
hard on the sound to keep it correct, then you are not ready yet 
for these exercises. Your breathing and the sound should by this 
time be fairly automatic such that they don’t take any focus at all. 
So sticking out your tongue should not change that breathing and 
sound. 

Lick the ceiling
Lick the chin
Lick the nose
Tongue in directions



220 Reichian technique, Part Two

Even though I cautioned about the throat, in fact each of the 
exercises on the tongue in this exercise have different primary 
effects. I am not going to tell you what those different primary 
effects are since I don’t want to lead you and, more important, I 
don’t want to give your subconscious reasons and methods to 
defend against the different effects.

A note of caution on these exercises. Shortly we will look at 
“lick the chin” and “lick the nose.” The ability of any person to 
accomplish much extension and bending of the tongue is very 
much a function of each person’s mouth structure and genetics. 
As you know there is a little bit of tissue that connects the bottom 
of your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. In some people this 
tissue is short and thus the tongue can not be extended very far. 
Further the ability to bend the tongue to the chin or the nose is a 
result of your individual genetic muscle structure. Therefore just 
do your individual best and push as best you can but don’t be 
concerned if you are not as good as the models and don’t take it 
as some sign of progress if you are better than the models.

First, we will look at just sticking the tongue straight out 
in the lick the ceiling exercise. 

LICK THE CEILING

Figure 88

This model does a good job of sticking out his tongue (licking 
the ceiling), but, as you’ll see shortly, he is not as good at other 
parts of the tongue work.



Chapter 14, Tongue                          221
There are three common errors in these exercises. 
When the tongue is out, it is allowed to relax and not be fully 

extended. In each of the first three exercises make sure that you 
are constantly pushing your tongue out as far as possible. Do not 
let it relax back into your mouth. This is difficult for most people 
to feel. They can not feel that they have allowed their tongue to 
relax. If you have a VCR or DVD camera, you can set it up so

Figure 89

that it photographs you while you do the exercises and then you 
can view it later (after the session) to see if you were letting your 
tongue relax back into your mouth. Don’t stop the session to view 
the video. It is not a serious error if the tongue relaxes, it simply 
will not accomplish as much. So the proper procedure is to go on 
with the session and look at any video later. This error is shown 
in the right panel of Figure 89

A second common error is that when the tongue is stuck out, 
the mouth is nearly closed so that the lower teeth are used to push 
or hold the tongue. This is especially true of the ‘lick the nose’ 
exercise. For all the tongue exercises, keep you mouth open as 
widely as possible. Here, again, you can use a video camera to 
record your performance and view it after the session.

In Figure 90 on page 222 you can see, left to right, how after 
doing the exercise for a few minutes the mouth closes. 



222 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 90

The third mistake is that the sound changes. It is almost as if 
people think that there is some relationship of the tongue muscles 
to the vocal cords. There are none. It is another example of a 
fused muscle set. Try not to change the ‘ah’ sound on the exhale. 
There is a tendency to change the ‘ah’ sound from a soft easy 
sound to a hard guttural sound. 

LICK THE NOSE

Stick your tongue straight out as far as possible and up as 
though to lick your nose. Hold it there for about five minutes. 
Remember to keep your mouth open. Note in this photograph that 
the model has closed his mouth and is using his lower teeth and 
lip in at attempt to push his tongue up to lick his nose. This is not 
correct, the mouth should stay fully open. 

Figure 91



Chapter 14, Tongue                          223

LICK THE CHIN

Stick your tongue out as far as possible and down as though to 
lick your chin. Hold it there for about five minutes. The breathing 
should not change from the normal rhythm and sound. Please, 
when doing these tongue exercise, remember that you are a 
student of the work. Don’t assume that you will get it right at the 
start. All these exercises take learning and allowing the 
subconsciousness’ image of your body time to change

Figure 92

You might note in the above figure that the model on the left 
is better able to lick his chin than is the model on the right. This 
provides an example of how performance can differ from one 
exercise to the next. Recall in Figure 91 that the model on the left 
had to use his lower jaw to do the lick the nose exercise but here 
in lick the chin he is better at it than the model on the right.

TONGUE IN DIRECTIONS

This exercise is like eyes in directions (Chapter 11, page 189) 
but with the tongue. For one full breath, inhale and exhale, the 
tongue is down to the chin. to the right, up to the nose, to the left. 
Remember to keep your mouth well open. The jaw should not 



224 Reichian technique, Part Two

move (to open or close) as the tongue is moved from one 
direction to another.

Figure 93

Postscript 

The order of exercises which I present in Part Two of this 
book would probably not be followed by a therapist in an office 
practice. There are a host of reasons why, with any given patient, 
the therapist would properly deviate significantly from this order 
of exercises. As one example, I indicated that you should not do 
the tongue exercises before you have mastered the ‘ah’ sound. 
But the tongue exercises also aid in opening the throat. Thus a 
therapist might use the tongue exercises early in the work as a 
way to help open the patient’s throat. 

Dr. Regardie, my therapist, had one patient where, for reasons 
best left unsaid, he had to start the Reichian work on the patient’s 



Chapter 14, Tongue                          225
feet. He had to ignore all issues of breathing and ‘ah’ sound until, 
with pressure, he had made real progress on the patient’s feet. 

By a like token, there are cases where the legs are treated 
before the arms and shoulders. 

I had a case where, from almost the first session, I had to use 
strong pressure on the back muscles again ignoring issues of 
breathing and exhale sounds (though not ignoring the forehead 
and eye work). 

What I have presented in this book is the best general — not 
particularized to specific individuals — advice I could give. 
Working in the order I have presented here may, at its worst, 
slow down the work but it should not present any serious 
problems.

Chapter 15, Neck                            227

CHAPTER 15

THE NECK

The neck is difficult to work on without a helper to work with 
you. However, it should not under any circumstances be slighted. 
Think about it this way: your brain takes care of all the thinking 
issues while your body takes care of all the emotive issues. This 
is over-simplified, but it serves to make the point. 

Between your brain which creates affect and your body which 
expresses emotion and your brain which recognizes feelings, is 
the choke point of the neck. Of course the neck does not really 
choke off feeling, but the way the body works the neck tends to 
serve that function. In a simple way to think about it, the neck 
splits your thinking from your feelings. It is rare to find someone 
who has problems with emotion and where the neck is not 
tense.28

The exercises below will do as much as can be done by 
yourself to free up the neck. If you have any neck problems in 
your spine, you should check with your doctor to see which of 
these exercises you can do.

28.Author’s admission: neither Reich nor Lowen placed much 
emphasis on the neck. For about 20 years I, too, paid little atten-
tion to the neck. It was a major error on my part. Work on the neck 
turns out to be crucial to successful body-work therapy.

228 Reichian technique, Part Two

 HEAD TO CHEST 

Lying in the working position, on the inhale raise your head to 
your chest. On the exhale let it drop back. There are several items 
of performance in this exercise for it to work properly.

First, the breathing should proceed normally. There is a strong 
tendency in this exercise to tense the abdominal muscles. Try not 
to do this. The normal belly-chest breathing should proceed just 
as though you were not moving your head. After you get the head 
movement down pat, as discussed and illustrated below, then you 
should come back to check on whether you are tensing the 
abdominal muscles. To do that simply place one hand flat on 
your abdomen while you are doing the head lift. If you are 
tensing your abdomen you will be able to feel it.

Next point, when the head is dropped back there is a tendency 
to lower the head rather than letting it fall back. Let your head 
fall. Do not gradually move it back.

Finally, the most important issue. When the head comes to the 
chest THE MOVEMENT IS NOT SIMPLY TILTING YOUR 
CHIN TO YOUR CHEST! The head comes out and down, not 
just down. An easy way to tell that you are doing it correctly is as 
follows. First just bring your chin to your chest. Place a finger on 
your chest just below the point where you chin and chest meet 
(Figure 94). 

Figure 94



Chapter 15, Neck                            229
Now, leaving your finger there, if you properly bring your 

head out and around to your chest, your finger will be covered 
by your chin (Figure 95). 

Figure 95

Get accustomed to that motion so you can do it without the 
finger there (though it does not hurt to test periodically to see that 
you are still doing it correctly).

Here are two photos of what the “head out and around” looks 
like while the head moves.

Figure 96

This exercise is not measured by the time doing it. This 
exercise fairly quickly tires the neck muscles and that is the time 
to stop.

Performance note: this exercise DOES NOT involve rolling 
the shoulders. It is done solely with the head. Figure 97 shows the 
exercise being done wrongly. In Figure 97 the shoulders are 
rolled up.



230 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 97

HEAD OFF BED, HEAD TO CHEST

This is a more advanced exercise and puts more strain on the 
spine. Again, if you have any spinal problems in your neck, it 
would be advisable to check with your doctor before you do this 
exercise. Master the head to chest exercise before you move on to 
this more advanced exercise.

This exercise can produce dizziness and nausea. In general it 
is not a good idea to do this exercises within three hours of 
eating. 

Here you move toward to head of the bed so that your head 
hangs fully over the bed. Do be stingy on this. There is a 
tendency to move only half way so that the end of the bed is 
impacting the neck. You should move toward the head of the bed 
so that only your shoulders are still on the bed. In Figure 98, the 
left photograph shows the body not far enough to the head end of 
the bed, the right photograph shows correct placement.



Chapter 15, Neck                            231

Figure 98

Let your head hang down. On the inhale bring your head out 
and around (don’t just tuck the chin). On the exhale let your head 
drop back. Again guard against tensing the abdominal muscles 
when you bring your head up. Note that this is a drop of the head 
not a lowering. While the motion of the head is slow to the chest 
during the inhale, it is a relaxing and letting drop at the start of 
the exhale. Also, do not throw your head back, just let it drop.

Neither dizziness nor nausea is any danger signal in terms of 
this exercise. Obviously if it is too unpleasant or too strong you 
should stop the exercise, but otherwise continue until your neck 
muscles are exhausted. 



232 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 99

MUSSOLINI JAW 

The Mussolini jaw29 exercises is an advance on the head to 
chest exercise. When you have mastered the proper movement in 
the head to chest exercise, then you can move onto the Mussolini 
jaw exercise. That is not to say that one replaces the other. They 
both have their individual uses. The head to chest exercise has 
priority only for learning purposes, not for effect purposes. This 
exercise might tempt you. It is certainly OK to try it a few times, 
but just for the experience of it, don’t start doing this exercise 
until you have thoroughly mastered the head to chest exercise.

29.  The name for this exercise, Mussolini Jaw, was used by Dr. 
Regardie. The name is retained.

In Part One of this book of the I spoke about 
hanging the head over the bed as a way to work 
on the issue of using the accessory muscles of 
respiration. The discussion is in Chapter seven, 
starting on page 140. There you were hanging 
the head over the bed and letting it hang there 
while you worked to get chest expansion. Here 
you are bringing the head up during the inhale.



Chapter 15, Neck                            233

Since this exercise also involves growling and shouting, you 
should at least have practiced on those two breathing techniques 
before you get to this exercise.

Mussolini jaw is somewhat more difficult to explain, so bear 
with me. Note that this exercise is different from all the rest in 
that it is done one time, then there is a rest period, then it is done 
again, then rest, etc. The length of the rest is half a dozen to a 
dozen breaths. It is common that when this exercise is first used 
(and that is, to repeat, after the head to chest exercise is mastered) 
that it does not produce much. You do it, let’s say, for six 
executions and there does not seem to be any effect. That’s fine. 
Even though there is no effect, the work you have done is 
sufficient for the given session. This exercise should not be 
overdone. 

1. This exercise is only done after mastering the head to
chest exercise.

2. You should have already mastered, or at least be
reasonably good at, the growl and the shout.

3. IMPORTANT: the exercise is done only one time. 
Then just breathe normally for a half a dozen or a 
dozen breaths; then do the exercise again.



234 Reichian technique, Part Two

In time, especially as you do all the other work, this exercise 
will start to have its effects. 

The exercise starts with extending the jaw. The jaw is 
extended for the whole of the single execution of the exercise. As 
discussed previously in the jaw out exercise on page 213, don’t 
let your jaw relax; keep pushing it out. Also, as discussed, don’t 
clench your teeth. The mouth should be open at least to the extent 
that you can stick your thumb between your top and bottom teeth 
while the jaw is extended (Figure 100).

Figure 100

Next, the movement of the head is identical to the head to 
chest exercise: out and around, not just tucking the chin (page 
228).

One note of caution. The idea of learning to deal 
with anger is to be able to use it productively. It 
is not the goal to walk around angry all the time. 
It is a not uncommon experience of Reichian 
therapists that they get someone who has been in 
Bioenergetic therapy and the person is so 
indoctrinated to be angry that he is untreatable. 
Moderation and learning are the keys.



Chapter 15, Neck                            235
Third, as always, the breathing should continue: belly then 

chest, and the abdomen should not be tensed while lifting the 
head.

Finally, aside from the chin out, the major difference between 
this exercise and the head to chest exercise comes in the exhale. 
During the exhale you will be doing several things. Here is the 
list and then I will describe each of the components.

1.     growl till the end of the exhale

It takes most students a long time of practice to learn to growl. 
Keep trying. If you get good at growling, it will feel to you as 

1. This exercise is only done after mastering the head to
chest exercise.

2. You should have already mastered, or at least be
reasonably good at, the growl and the shout.

3. IMPORTANT: the exercise is done only one time. 
Then just breathe normally for a half a dozen or a
 dozen breaths; then do the exercise again.

4. Start the exercise by extending (protruding) the jaw (as
you did in the jaw out exercise)

5. The jaw is extended for the whole exercise, the inhale
and the exhale.

6. The inhale is normal, but during the exhale all the
 following happens:
a. your growl during the whole exhale
b. the head is brought out and around to the chest
c. as the head comes to the chest, the arms are brought 

up and back with the elbows bent
d. you end the exhale with:

1.   a shout
2.   whip the arms back and hit the bed with as much

   force as you can
3.   throw the head back

7. Then breathe normally (only one execution at a time)



236 Reichian technique, Part Two

though the growl were coming from your chest rather than your 
voice box. 

The growl starts at the beginning of the exhale and continues 
to the end (when it becomes a shout). It is not a bad idea to spend 
the necessary time, in preparation for the Mussolini jaw, just 
growling on the exhale. This practice is to learn to open the throat 
and keep it open so that the sound is correct. Growl exhale is also 
an exercise in Part One of this book.

Another problem arises from the last part of the exhale which 
is a shout. This, again, is something you can practice all by itself 
(that is practice just the growl and just the shout without 
bothering with the jaw and the head). The usual problem is that 
the student can not tell when the exhale is almost done and there 
is just enough air left to do the shout. 

The exhale, after the growl, should end with a shout. After the 
shout all the air should have been exhaled. Some students do not 
leave enough breath for the shout. Then the shout becomes kind 
of a little grunt rather than a shout. Other students do the shout 
too early and then they continue the exhale after the shout. 

2.     lift the arms over the head during the exhale

As the head comes to the chest (with the growl), the arms are 
raised over the head. You might think of it as a spring. As the 
head comes up and around it adds tension to the arms that are 
raising. Note that the arms are bent as they come back over the 
head. In the next section of this book, on the shoulders, I will 
describe another exercise that brings the arms up but there the 
arms are straight.



Chapter 15, Neck                            237

Figure 101

Figure 102

In Figure 102 the arms have been brought all the way back. 
Note that this model could not, in this exercise, get his head all 
the way to his chest. Further the photo shows the model with his 
hands open rather than closed into a fist. Both are errors.

3.     end the exercise with a shout and striking the bed

It should take almost the whole exhale to bring the head to the 
chest and the arms up. All the while you are growling, hopefully 
from the chest. 

A common mistake in this exercise is to jerk the head to the 
chest, taking only a small part of the exhale. The movement of 
the arms and the head are slow and coordinated. That is during 



238 Reichian technique, Part Two

the whole exhale the head is moved slowly to the chest and the 
arms are moved slowly all the way up. Keep in mind the idea of 
the spring. The head movement is adding strength (that is, anger) 
to the arms.

The head gets to the chest near the end of the exhale. There is, 
however, still some air left. Don’t take so long to bring the head 
to the chest and the arms up that there is no air or virtually no air 
left.

At the end of the exhale you shout to finish the exhale and the 
arms are brought forcefully around to hit the bed. You should 
have a closed fist. Treat the strike as though you were going to 
break the bed. That is, the strike has all your available power (and 
anger) in the strike. 

Figure 103

In the photograph above, again the model has his hands open 
instead of closed into a fist in order to strike the bed forcefully.

4.     end the exercise by throwing the head back

Here the head is thrown back (against the bed) as part of the 
aggressive shout and hitting. As always, after the end of the 
exhale and the movements the inhale is started immediately (see 
the rhythmic breathing in Part One of the book).

All three things: the shout, the strike, and the throwing of the 
head are a single action. That is, they are all done at the same 



Chapter 15, Neck                            239
time. The idea is to let the beginning of the exhale build the anger 
and the end of the exhale to let the anger loose. 

This is the way you learn to have anger, express the anger, and 
let the anger go. 

Many people are afraid of anger. They fear it will overwhelm 
them if they let it be felt and expressed. This is equivalent to 
someone who is afraid of swimming because he feels that he will 
drown if he tries to swim. The analogy to swimming is apt. If 
someone does not know how to swim or float, then he will 
drown. But once he learns to swim or float, the fear of drowning 
is gone. So, too, with anger. It someone does not know how to 
experience anger, deal with it, and let it go then he may become 
overwhelmed. But once he has learned to handle anger, it is no 
longer a threat.

ROLL THE HEAD 

This is a soft exercise. It you do this exercise and it does not 
produce any feelings, simply put off the exercise until later in 
your work when your brain/body is ready for it.

Here the head is rolled side to side. It is the same motion you 
make when you shake your head “no.” The difference is that the 
range of motion should be as far to each shoulder as your 
structure allows. Don’t toss your head, just any easy rolling of the 
head from side to side as far as your range of motion allows. 

This rolling can be either just on the exhale or on both the 
inhale and the exhale. The IMPORTANT issue is that on the 
exhale you vocalize a word or phrase. Don’t just speak the word 
or phrase, try to put some “feeling” into it as though you were an 
actor.

There is no set group of words or phrases. Use any word or

seem to have some reaction. Here are some suggestions, but they

This is a good place for an author’s editorial.

EDITORIAL

One hundred years ago when Freud was developing psycho-
analysis, the disowned part of the human being was sex. In 
Europe of the late 19th century and early 20th century the great 
naughty was anything sexual. Not that there was not a lot of sex, 
as long as human beings have been around there has always been 
a lot of sex. That is why we are still around. It is only that sex was 
the great not-talked-about subject and any overt sexual 
expression was taboo. 

Now there is a new taboo. It is anger. Boys are feminized in 
our schools as any fighting is forbidden. Even verbal aggression 
is forbidden. States like New York and California make it nearly 
impossible to have a gun to protect oneself. Washington, D.C. 
has the most restrictive gun laws in the country which is why 
Washington, D.C. is the murder capital of the country.30

But aggression is as much a part of the human being as is sex. 
Actually the two drives are equal and opposite. There are circuits 
in the brain for aggression (anger) just as there are circuits in the 
brain for sex. There is another close connection. Sex is the 
procreative drive, anger is the creative drive.

At this point I have to draw a distinction between a drive and 
the expression of that drive. Sex can be creative as in love or it 
can be destructive as in rape. Anger can be creative as in 
productivity (more on this shortly) or it can be destructive as in 
murder. This is true not only of sex and anger, it is true of all 
human needs and drives and all human behavior. 

30. Actually, I could extend this discussion to include all “unpleas-
ant” or all “insensitive” or all “offensive” statements or behaviors. 
We are currently in an age of mass bigotry where only approved 
statements may be made. Where once we proudly said “Man is the 
measure of all things” we now say “Man is the destroyer of all 
things.” A country or civilization bent on self-destruction will get 
self-destruction. It deserves no more than that.



242 Reichian technique, Part Two

Even seemingly benign things can be creative or destructive. 
Water can keep you alive or it can drown you. Food can keep you 
alive or it can produce obesity and a consequent fatal heart attack.

Playfulness (another human drive) can yield pleasure and 
enjoyment or it can yield cruel hazing. And so it goes for all 
human needs and activities. But however much a need and drive 
can be misused, it is certain that the suppression or denial of the 
need and drive will produce destruction. 

Suppress food and you get starvation. Suppress playfulness 
and you get hard, unyielding, dour, hateful adults. Suppress sex 
and you get the dark periods of Christianity and the 7th century 
religion of Islam. Suppress anger and you get docile people who 
only look to some magically powerful government to tell them 
what to do and where hate should be directed. 

But productivity and docility are opposites. Why does 
someone redecorate, create a new product, work hard to 
accomplish a goal, do anything creative? The answer is simple: 
he doesn’t like things the way they are now. It is displeasure at 
the current state of something that supplies the energy, the drive, 
to change that state. Without anger, creativity dries up. To say “I 
don’t like” is to say “it angers me.” It is anger that we draw on to 
give us the drive and the determination to change something. 
Anger is the emotion of creation. It is a measure of how decrepit 
the “western” world has become that we define anger as only 
destructive and as something that has to suppressed. 

Man split against himself can not long survive. As long as we 
can cannibalize the still smoldering anger of people from other 
cultures (China, India, etc.) we can continue. But that can not last 
long. The cannibal food of today is the cannibal master of 
tomorrow31. Anger can not be denied entirely. If anger is not 
permitted to be expressed outward in creative change then it will 
be expressed inward in self-hatred.

31. As the essayist Norman Podhoretz notes, Islam is World War III. 
China will likely be World War IV.



Chapter 15, Neck                            243
It is not likely that you can change the culture of self-hatred 

that now permeates much of the western world, but you can 
change your own disavowal of the humanness of your anger. We 
are getting to the exercises that will recover your anger and make 
it available for your creative use. The Mussolini jaw exercise is 
the first of these, others will follow later in this book.32

32. Actually the growl exhale and the express anger in the eyes are 
the first exercises, but why be so technical.



244 Reichian technique, Part Two



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        245

CHAPTER 16

THE SHOULDERS

We have worked our way down from the forehead, the eyes, 
the face, the jaw, and the neck. Each of these areas was fairly 
well demarcated. As we come to the next set of areas we begin to 
get mixtures. As we work with the shoulders, we are also 
working on the chest and when we work with the chest we will 
also be working on the diaphragm and the abdomen. What I am 
saying is that now the effects of the work begin to spread across 
areas.

When I wrote up the face and the neck there were some very 
specific instructions on how to do the exercise properly. In those 
cases if you did the exercise wrongly the only negative result 
would be that the exercise would not work as intended. With the 
shoulders we start to get to exercises where if they are done 

Roll the shoulders together in front
Roll the shoulders together in the back
Tonic shrug the shoulders
Shrug up and throw down
    Way 1 - tongue in
    Way 2 - tongue out
Shake the shoulders loose
Arms up and hit
Arms crossed and hit
Choke the towel
Reach with the hands
Arms up and vocalize



246 Reichian technique, Part Two

incorrectly, you can actually accomplish the opposite of the 
intended result. That is, before error was harmless; now error can 
result in making you more rigid and stuck instead of improving 
yourself.

The shoulder work actually involves two different areas of 
tension that both relate to movement of the shoulders and the 
arms. There are a lot of exercises in this region so I will try to 
indicate which are the early exercises, which the later exercises, 
and with some I will include very explicit instructions on the 
right and wrong way to perform the exercise. Most of these 
exercises can be done before you finish with the breathing 
training but, in general, it is better if you have the breathing down 
fairly well before you start these exercises. There are a few very 
advanced exercises here. I will indicate that on the individual 
exercise.

ROLL THE SHOULDERS TOGETHER FRONT 

This is an easy exercise and can be done at any time. 
While continuing the breathing properly, bring your shoulders 

forward as though to touch them together in front of your body. 
Here the arms position is changed. Normally the arms are slightly 
bent (see Figure 2 in Part One on page 19) but here they are 
straightened so that the shoulders can be brought together in the 
front (Figure 104). Keep the tension for about five minutes.

Note that here you are not just pushing your shoulder forward, 
you are trying to bring them forward and together in front of your 
body.



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        247

Figure 104

A common issue here is that the student can not feel the 
tension in the shoulders or the student’s attention wavers. In both 
cases the shoulders tend to relax. The only fix for this is to pay 
close attention to the level of tension and work to keep it to the 
maximum amount for the full time of the exercise.

It turns out that this is also a good exercise for testing how 
well you are doing with chest breathing. With the shoulders 
pulled together it becomes a little more difficult to breathe 
properly into the chest.

 ROLL THE SHOULDERS TOGETHER BACK 

This exercise can be done at any time. It is physically more 
demanding than the above roll the shoulders together front, but 
other than usually more physically exhausting there is no 
limitation on when it can be done.

Here you are, in theory, trying to touch your two wing bones 
together. The shoulders can not physically move backward to the 
same degree that they can move forward, so the issue is the 
tensing of the muscles between the wing bones and maintaining 
as much tension as possible. Hold the tension for about five 
minutes or, if you can’t do that, until your muscles tire.



248 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 105

Again we have the same potential issue as in the previous 
exercise. The student is unable to feel the tension or his attention 
wavers and the full degree of tension is lost. Simply do your best 
to concentrate on your shoulders pulled together as though the 
two wing bones were trying to touch each other.

This might be a good time to add one of my standard 
warnings. This is not a race or a contest. There is always the next 
session. Do the exercise as well as you can and at some later 
session try it again. In time you will be able to do it for the full 
five minutes or so.

In Figure 105 you might note another example of fusing. Our 
model took my instruction to “roll your shoulders together in 
back as if you were trying to touch your shoulder blades 
together” and converted it into arching the back in the attempt to 
roll his shoulders together.

TONIC SHRUG THE SHOULDERS 

This is an easy exercise that may be done at any time. 
Shrug your shoulders and hold them as tightly as possible. 

Continue the effort to hold them in the shrugged position as 
tightly as possible. Don’t just shrug them and then hold there, 
rather shrug them and keep trying to get the shoulder muscle 
(here the trapezius) tighter and tighter.

Continue your breathing normally: belly then chest inhale, 
start the exhale with an easy ‘ah’ sound, belly then chest exhale. 



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        249

Figure 106

This exercise is also one of the daily exercises. Here, however, 
you are adding the breathing which makes it both harder and 
more effective. By shrugging the shoulders you prevent the use 
of some of accessory muscles of respiration (primarily the 
pectorals and, to a lesser degree, the muscles at the front side of 
the neck). The fact of this hard constant (i.e. tonic) shrugging of 
the shoulders may have a large effect on your ability to breathe 
into the chest. That only indicates that you still have work to do 
on freeing the muscles between the ribs. 

It sometimes helps to free the chest muscles of respiration (the 
intercostals) to do this exercise; and, while holding the shrug 
tightly, concentrate on feeling your chest muscles move with the 
inhale. Recall that you can use a tape measure with a paper clip to 
check on chest expansion.

SHRUG UP AND THROW DOWN 

This is a critical exercise and it is extraordinarily easy to do it 
wrongly. This exercise has as much, perhaps even more, effect on 
the chest than on the shoulders but it is included as a shoulder 
exercise since that is the part of the body being used. 

This exercise is a little more advanced. That is not to say that 
you can not start early in your work to practice it. It is only to say 
that the effects are cumulative and it will produce more benefit 
during the middle part of your training than at the beginning.



250 Reichian technique, Part Two

In this exercise the single initial ‘ah’ sound of the breath is 
going to change. Here you are going to insert multiple ‘ah’ 
sounds into the exhale. DON’T STOP THE EXHALE FOR THE 
SOUND. The multiple ‘ah’ sounds are inserted into the exhale 
stream without stopping the exhale process.

If you like, you can practice just this part of the exercise until 
you have it down correctly. Take a full inhale, start the exhale 
with the soft ‘ah’ sound and then as you exhale add a few more 
‘ah’ sounds. The ‘ah’ sounds during the exhale should sound 
exactly the same as the first ‘ah’ sound. That is, they all should be 
soft with no articulation or guttural and they should be an ‘ah’ not 
a ‘ha’ or a ‘huh’ or any other sound.

Next we look at the shoulder movement. It is JERK up 
(shrugging the shoulders) and THROW down. IMPORTANT: 
this is NOT a pull up and a push down. It is a jerk up and throw 
down. 

This is the first of the several errors possible. By a JERK up, I 
mean just that. It is not just a shrug. If you do it properly you will 
feel it almost bounce your neck and head. It is difficult in words 
to describe the jerk. We are all accustomed to shrugging our 
shoulders. But the jerk is something we don’t do naturally. Here 
is a method that might help to get the idea of a jerk as opposed to 
just a quick shrug.

Sit in a chair that has arms (Figure 107). Place your arms on 
the chair’s arms and you hands in your lap. Now if you jerk 
properly, that is with enough speed and strength, (1) you will feel 
it in your neck muscles and (2) your hands will bounce off your 
legs.

2. the shoulders are JERKED up and THROWN down



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        251

Figure 107

But in addition to a shrug up, there is a throw down. By a 
THROW down I mean just that. Again, if it is done properly you 
will feel it in your chest. As the shoulders are thrown down, a 
part of the motion is inherited by the chest so that there is a slight 
ballistic effect on the chest sending it down a little bit and it then 
bounces back. Note that if your chest is rigid, you may not feel 
this in your chest but the effect should be there and when your 
chest is looser you will feel it. 

This part too you can practice in a chair but one without arms. 
Here shrug normally but tightly. Then thrown your shoulder 
down. You should feel this in your neck muscles. 

In this exercise the arms are straight and turned so that the 
hands are against the body. In the usual working posture your 
hands are against the bed. Here they are against your body.



252 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 108

There are a number of other errors that occur frequently in this 
exercise. One, of course, is to not do a hard and fast jerk up. The 
shrug is a jerk-the-shoulders-up. Another is to not do a hard and 
fast throw. 

The most common error, however, is to make this exercise a 
motion of the arms instead of the shoulders. 

Your arms should be rigid during this exercise: the elbows 
should not bend at any time and the hands should not be flicked. 
The whole motion is done with the shoulders and should be felt 
there, not in the arms or hands. The wrong bending of the arms 
and/or hands is shown, exaggerated, in Figure 109 on page 253. 
Even when the arms and hands are kept straight so that the 
motion has to come from the shoulders, still there is the tendency 
to treat the motion as one occurring in the arms. To the trained 
observer the difference between throwing of the shoulders and 
throwing of the arms is evident. But to the person doing this 
exercise on his own, I can only caution that you should focus 
your thinking on the felt muscular experience to insure that the 
throw comes from the throwing the shoulders down rather than 
throwing the arms down.



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        253

Figure 109

Now to the exercise itself.
On a single jerk (up) of the shoulders, gasp the inhale. Up till 

now you have been always breathing with the normal rhythmic 
inhale and exhale. This changes for this exercise. Here the inhale 
will be done quickly as a gasp. It is better if the gasp is a “gasp 
inhale chest” as presented in Part One of the book, but a “gasp 
inhale belly” is OK. Obviously you will not be able to inhale the 
same volume of air as you do when you are doing a normal slow 
inhale. It is important that the inhale be extremely rapid so that it 
is started and completed during just a single jerk of the shoulders.

Now the exhale. Here the description is not easy to put in 
words. After the gasp inhale, your shoulders are shrugged about 
your ears. Now you start a series of throw-down jerk-up all on the 
same breath and starting each throw with an easy ‘ah’ sound. You 
can get three to five movements on the same breath. That is: 
throw, jerk, throw, jerk with inhale; or throw, jerk, throw, jerk, 
throw, jerk with inhale. 

1. during the exhale there are multiple ‘ah’ sounds
2. the shoulders are JERKED up and THROWN down
3. common errors during the shoulder movement

a. shrug is slow or not vigorous
b. throw is slow or not vigorous
c. motion is throwing the arms instead of the shoulders



254 Reichian technique, Part Two

NOTE: THE ‘AH’ SOUND IS MADE ONLY ON THE 
THROW-DOWN. THE JERK-UP IS DONE WITHOUT A 
SOUND INSERTED INTO THE EXHALE.

There are four errors often made in this exercise: (1) speed is 
too fast; (2) either the jerk or the throw is lost and it becomes a 
motion, even a fast motion, rather than a jerk or throw; (3) the 
sound changes from the easy ‘ah’ to a breath-stopping 
articulation or guttural with each throw; (4) only one throw is 
done with each breath such that each jerk is done with a new 
inhale. 

In order to avoid these errors it may help if you practice each 
part of the exercise separately. Try just the exhale with multiple 
‘ah’ sounds and work just at that until you get a steady exhale – 
no pauses, no stopping – at each ‘ah’ sound. Then ignore the 
breathing entirely and just concentrate on the jerk and throw. You 
can also break this up into two parts. Get the feel of just the jerk 
and then get the feel of just the throw. Finally put everything 
together as one exercise.

speed is too fast

The jerk-then-throw sequence is not a race and should not be 
done with rapidity. Just to provide some idea of the speed, let’s 

1. during the exhale there are multiple ‘ah’ sounds
2. the shoulders are JERKED up and THROWN down
3. common errors during the shoulder movement

a. shrug is slow or not vigorous
b. throw is slow or not vigorous
c. motion is throwing the arms instead of the shoulders

4. gasp the inhale along with a jerk up of the shoulders
5. now do a series of throw and jerk, on each throw add a

soft ‘ah’ sound on the jerk
6. at the end of your breath, do another jerk with a gasp

inhale



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        255
say that each motion, after completion, is maintained for 2 
seconds. This is not a rule; it is a conceptual guide. There is a 
tendency in people first doing this exercise to jump quickly from 
one position (e.g. jerk) to the other (throw) and back. There are 
three reasons why this is wrong: (1) it strongly increases the 
tendency to inhale with each jerk rather than a single inhale 
covering a series of motions; (2) it strongly increases the 
tendency to make the initial gasp inhale very shallow such that 
the speed is needed if three to five motions are to be completed in 
a single breath (the initial gasp can not be like a full breath, but it 
should not be so shallow that little air is brought in); (3) if the 
motions are done rapidly, both the jerk and the throw will quickly 
become just motions not real jerks and throws.

When this movement sequence is done too rapidly (moving 
from throw-to-jerk or jerk-to-throw), it is difficult if not perhaps 
impossible to get the proper vehemence into each motion. 

One way to slow yourself down and get in the proper habit of 
this jerk and then throw exercise is: after the completion of  each 
motion slowly say the word “pause” in your head and only allow 
the next movement after the ‘pause’ word is finished.

either the jerk or the throw is lost  

Because the jerk and the throw both require either focus on 
what you are doing or the body habit of doing it correctly; it is 
easy to slip from a true jerk and a true throw into just a quick 
shoulder movement, that is, the shoulder movement becomes 
only a rapid raising or lowering of the shoulders rather than a jerk 
or throw. 

the sound changes

7. common errors due to too speedy execution
a. it tends to cause each jerk to be done with an inhale
b. it tend to make the gasp inhale too shallow
c. it is nearly impossible to do a properly vigorous 

throw and jerk if the speed is too fast



256 Reichian technique, Part Two

There is a strong tendency in this exercise to change the 
sound, usually from an ‘ah’ to an ‘uh’ or ‘huh.’ In other words, 
there is a tendency to change the sound from a relaxed sigh to a 
sound of effort or exertion. 

There is also a strong tendency to stop the exhale to make the 
sound. A good way to practice this exercise, in working up to 
good practice habits, is to do it with no sound. Just get the exhale 
such that it is continuous during the three to five jerk and throw 
motions before you do another gasp inhale with the jerk. Once 
you have the continuous exhale well set as a habit, then you can 
add the sound. Perhaps you start with a single ‘ah’ during the first 
throw. Once you have that, then you can go to the full 
performance of the soft and non-guttural, non-articulated ‘ah’ 
sound with each throw.

only one throw is done with each breath

The final common error is to do a mini-inhale with each jerk-
up of the shoulders. There should be only one (gasp) inhale 
followed by continuous exhale for the full three to five motions 
before another inhale. The Reichian effect of inhaling with each 
jerk is very different from the effect of the single inhale followed 
by a prolonged slow exhale during a series of jerks and throws.

7. common errors due to too speedy execution
a. it tends to cause each jerk to be done with an inhale
b. it tend to make the gasp inhale too shallow
c. it is nearly impossible to do a properly vigorous 

throw and proper jerk if the speed is too fast
8. common errors of changing the sound

a. the sound changes from a soft ‘ah’ to a strong ‘uh’ 
or the like

b. the sound is articulated or guttural instead of merely
being inserted into a continuous exhale breath

c. a tendency to break up the exhale so that is it a
series of short exhales instead of one continuous
exhale

WAY ONE – TONGUE IN

The first form of this exercise is done as described above. 
Here you are mainly concerned with getting the feel of all the 
elements: (1) the gasp inhale breath, (2) the jerk up, (3) the throw 
down, (4) the ‘ah’ sound with each throw but no sound on the 
jerk, (5) being able to do three to five sets of jerk/throw during 
the exhale of one breath. 

1. during the exhale there are multiple ‘ah’ sounds
2. the shoulders are JERKED up and THROWN down

4. gasp the inhale along with a jerk up of the shoulders
5. now do a series of throw and jerk, on each throw add a

soft ‘ah’ sound on the jerk
6. at the end of your breath, do another jerk with a gasp

inhale
7. common errors due to too speedy execution

exhale

9. common error of inhaling with each jerk instead of
of one gasp inhale followed by a series of throw and
jerk motions during the exhale



258 Reichian technique, Part Two

Don’t be in a rush to get to way two. It is a simple extension 
and thus it depends on being able to do the exercise correctly as 
in way one. Whether this exercise is done in way one or way two, 
it is a very good exercise. You can profitably do this one exercise 
for 30 minutes at a time, for a whole session or half a session.

WAY TWO – TONGUE OUT

This is the same as way one except that the tongue is out in the 
lick-the-chin position. If you have not yet mastered the lick the 
chin exercise, there is no reason to attempt this way two of the 
exercise which combines the shrug the shoulders and the lick the 
chin exercises. Remember to keep your mouth open.

SHAKE THE SHOULDERS LOOSE 

Here again we have a crucial exercise with rather startling 
extra benefits. The extra benefit comes in loosening up the chest, 
but that benefit can not be measured unless you have a helper. I 
will tell you how to measure after I first present the exercise. 

This exercise is a little more advanced. But it can be good to 
start this exercise early due to its strong effect on the chest. 

Like the shrug the shoulders exercise, this exercise has some 
fairly specific requirements if it is to accomplish its objective. 

First, the breathing. This exercise also uses a single rapid 
inhale and a gradual exhale. However, the inhale while rapid is 
not a gasp inhale. This is because the shoulder movements here 
are not as abrupt as in the shrug the shoulders exercise and 
therefore the inhale, while quick, is not a gasp. Still, the inhale is 
done during one shoulder movement while the exhale is done 
during a series of shoulder movements. It is not a major issue in 
this exercise, but it is better if you can make the inhale be to both 
the belly and the chest. 

Here the arms are extended. That is they are pointed toward 
the ceiling, perpendicular to the body. Also the hands are turned 
so that the palms face each other.



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        259

Figure 110

The arms are alternately thrust upward. It is very important 
that this be a thrust not just a movement. With each thrust the 
previously thrust arm is brought back to the bed while the other 
arm is thrust upward.

Figure 111



260 Reichian technique, Part Two

A common error in this exercise is to make it a rocking motion 
of the two arms rather than a thrust of one arm while the other 
arm is allowed to return to the resting position. The idea is to 
thrust the one arm upward while the other arm (which was 
previously thrust upward) is allowed to relax back to the bed.

As with the shrug the shoulders exercise, the arm movement 
here is not just a simple movement upwards. Rather it is a thrust. 
Since the hands are straight (not bent at the wrist at any time), 
you can think of it is though your fingers were trying to pierce 
something. Another way to think about it is: if your hand were 
held as a fist then you would be punching something. 

Again, the movement is with the shoulder, not the arm. Thus 
the elbow is locked as is the wrist. The thrust comes from the 
shoulder, not from the arm. While you might think of it as 
thrusting the arm upward, the actual thrust comes only from the 
shoulder. There is a strong tendency in this exercise to make the 
thrust with the arm instead of the shoulder and to think it is being 
made from the shoulder. Figure 112 shows an exaggerated 
example of bending the arm at the elbow. You can learn the 
difference only by paying attention to the feel of your shoulder 
and gradually forming the habit of the shoulder thrust rather than 
an arm thrust.

Figure 112



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        261
Next, the breathing. The inhale is rapid but it is not a gasp. It is 

rapid only in the sense that the complete inhale is done in 
connection with the thrust of only one shoulder. I don’t mean the 
below example to be taken as any rigid order of sequence; it is 
only a way to explain the exercise in words.

You right shoulder is thrust upward while you inhale (as 
always, belly then chest). Now, as you start the exhale with the 
normal easy ‘ah’ sound, the right shoulder is relaxed down while 
the left shoulder is thrust upward. Now with another easy ‘ah’ 
sound, the left shoulder is relaxed and the right shoulder is thrust 
upward. Now with another easy ‘ah’ sound, the right shoulder is 
relaxed while the left shoulder is thrust upward. This alternation 
is continued until the exhale is finished; at which point the next 
upward thrust is accompanied by a new inhale. In general 
(though not a rule) you can do five thrusts on one exhale.

Before we look at the common errors, I just want to repeat that 
the shoulder movements alternate. One side thrusts up while the 
other side is allowed to fall back. Note that I said “fall back.” 
While it is a thrust with one side it is a simple ‘let if fall back to 
the bed’ with the other side. 

Again it is easy in this exercise to make errors which will 
reduce the effectiveness of the exercise. The errors are: (1) 
breathing, (2) sound, (3) arm or hand movement, (4) rocking the 
body instead of thrusting the shoulders, (5) moving too quickly.

breathing

I wish to emphasize that the sound on the exhale is the same 
easy ‘ah’ sound as always. There is a strong tendency with each 
thrust to momentarily stop the exhale in order to make the sound. 
This is not correct. The exhale continues, without pause, during 
the complete set of thrust-then-relax movements of the shoulders. 
The sound is simply inserted into the exhale as it continues. Let’s 
repeat that. The exhale is continuous during the set of alternate 
arm thrusts and each thrust has the ‘ah’ sound inserted into the 
continuous exhale.



262 Reichian technique, Part Two

sound

There is also a tendency to change the sound. The sound is not 
articulated (with the voice box closed and then opened), it is not a 
‘huh’ or an ‘uh’ or an ‘ugh’ or an ‘ho’ or an ‘oh’ or even a ‘ha.’ It 
is the same easy ‘ah’ you use in all exercises.

arm or hand movement

Make sure that you lock your elbow and your wrist. If you 
bend the arm at the elbow or the hand at the wrist, you will likely 
thrust with the arm or the hand rather than with the shoulder. The 
error of bending the elbow on this exercise is so common that it is 
almost normal. But it is not correct. Lock the elbow and the wrist 
and don’t let either of them bend or flex. See Figure 112 on page 
260

rocking the body

This exercise involves the shoulders, not the torso. Your torso 
should not rotate with the thrust. Certainly there is a ballistic 
rotation of the chest with the motion (this is, in fact, one of the 
purposes of the exercise), but this is very different from rotating 
the thorax to make the thrust. Try to keep the motion only to the 
shoulder. Figure 113 shows the error of rotating the torso rather 
than just thrusting with the shoulder.

common errors
1. the exhale is not continuous, it is broken up into a

series of short exhales
2. the sound changes from an easy ‘ah’ sound

speed

DO NOT SPEED UP THE THRUSTS. As with the shrug-the-
shoulders exercise, a good rule of thumb is that after each thrust 
say the word ‘pause’ slowly to yourself so that the change from 
one shoulder to the next is not fast. The issue with this exercise is 
that it is a thrust, not a rapid alteration of shoulders. If you race 
the alternating thrusts the exercise will not accomplish its 
purpose. You cannot thrust if you do the alternation rapidly. With 
rapid movement you will only get a protrusion of the arm not a 
thrust from the shoulder.

from the shoulder

4. the torso is rotated and lifted off the bed



264 Reichian technique, Part Two

ARMS UP AND HIT 

This is a general exercise and may be done at any time during 
the course of your self-work. This is another of the exercises 
where you learn to tolerate and control anger. 

The goal of this exercise is to become comfortable with 
controlled anger. Controlled in this sense does not mean that it 
does not or should not become very strong, it only means that the 
anger is vented in the context of a safe environment without it 
being directed physically against any person. You can, in fantasy, 
imagine that you are hitting a person if that helps you get the 
power into the hit.

During the inhale the arms are raised over the head and back 
with the elbows straight. Note the difference in the arm here to 
the Mussolini jaw exercise. In the Mussolini jaw exercise the 
arms were bent, here they are straight. 

You may raise the arms slowly during the inhale or quickly 
and not coordinated with the inhale. The exercise often works 
better if the arms are raised during the inhale so that again, as in 
the Mussolini jaw exercise, you are putting the tension into your 
arms with the breath. But this is not necessary for the exercise to 
work properly. 

Unless your fingernails are too long, you should use a fist. If 
you can’t form a fist, then you will have to hit open handed.

The difference in this exercise from previous ones is that the 
exhale is started with a shout instead of the ‘ah’ sound. The sound 
of the shout does make a difference, in fact a large difference. 

common errors
1. the exhale is not continuous, it is broken up into a

series of short exhales
2. the sound changes from an easy ‘ah’ sound
3. the elbow and hand are not locked and thus the

thrust comes from the arm or the hand rather than
from the shoulder

4. the torso is rotated and lifted off the bed
5. the exercise is sped up thus preventing the thrusts

from being forceful



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        265
First, it is an ‘uh’ sound rather than an ‘ah’ sound. Next, it is an 
open-throated sound. Here is a hint for which I have no real 
explanation. I have heard it often enough to know it is real, the 
why escapes me. If you have any metal in the room (even an air 
conditioning duct or a metal lamp), on an open throated shout 
you will hear the metal ring. That is, the metal will vibrate 
slightly so that you can hear a slight ring from the metal. With 
most people the throat is not open, it is tight. For that reason most 
people can not get a real shout. They get a yell or a scream or 
even just a loud sound; but not a shout. Again, perhaps it will 
help to think about the sound as though you were attacking an 
enemy and the shout was meant to frighten your advisory. You 
will find examples of wrong and right shouts on the Sounds of 
Reichian audio; there is also an example of the metal ringing 
effect (here from a ceiling fan).

So the exhale is started with a shout as the arms are brought 
forcefully forward to strike or pound the bed. Perhaps it will help 
to think about the strike as though you were trying to break the 
bed. To get the benefit of the exercise keep in mind that its 
purpose is to stimulate and sanction the feeling of anger, 
therefore hit the bed with as much feeling of anger as you can 
muster.

ARMS CROSSED AND HIT 

This is a general exercise and may be begun at any time 
during the course of your self-work. This is an alternate form to 
the previous exercise of arms up and hit.

The difference in this exercise from the previous one is (1) the 
arms are brought across the body as though you were going to 
fend off a blow and (2) the strike is with the arms and not with 
the forearms or hands.

Note that the arm is brought up at right angles to the body, the 
elbow is bent and the forearms are crossed (Figure 114). You 
arms are not next to the body (as though covering the breasts); 
they are extended above the body so that when you strike the bed 
the arms are out away from the body (90 degrees) at the shoulder 
level.

The arms are brought up on the inhale. This is a normal inhale. 
The exhale is started with an open throated shout at the same time 
as the arms are slammed against the bed. Like the previous hit-
the-bed exercise, the idea here is to sanction and facilitate the 
experience of anger. 

The difference in this exercise, and the reason why it 
accomplishes something different from the previous hit-the-bed 
exercise, is that most of the power here comes from the wing 
muscles.

CHOKE THE TOWEL 

This exercise uses a bath towel. You want to have the towel 
handy and folded before you begin the shoulder exercises so that 
you do not have to stop the work to get the towel. 

Lengthwise fold the towel in half and then in half again. Now 
fold the (1/4 width) towel in half. This is the towel you will use in 
this exercise and that you should have prepared ahead of time.

Grab the towel near the middle and twist it. Get it so that it is 
twisted as tightly as it will go (see Figure 115). After a normal 
inhale, on the exhale choke the towel as hard as you can and 
either growl with the exhale or use someone’s name as though 
you were choking that person. This is a safe way to express long- 
held hatred.

Figure 115

Most people tire quickly with this exercise so do it only as 
long as you have the strength. As always don’t force yourself 
beyond the demands of the particular work session.

REACH WITH THE HANDS 

This is a very soft exercise with very specific objectives. 
There is no harm in trying this exercise early in your self-work; 
but if it does not have a significant impact on you then it is being 
used too soon. Put it aside and try it again every six months or so 
until you find that it is impactful. 

On the inhale raise your arms directly over your body (toward 
the ceiling). Reach upward extending both shoulders. Reach as 
though you were trying to touch the ceiling. Both shoulders 
should be rounded and you can feel the pull in your wing 
muscles.

On the exhale, let your hands drop back to your chest. The 
arms do not lower, they drop. Women can let the hands flop onto 
the lower ribs beneath the breasts.



268 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 116

What you are doing is mimicking the gesture made by 
children when they want to be picked up by an adult. Thus it 
helps if, when you are reaching upward, you try to create in 
yourself the desire to be picked up or held or nurtured or soothed 
or protected. Note in the left photograph above that the fingers 
are spread.

If you find after a few minutes that the exercise is only 
mechanical, that you are not having any emotive response, then 
stop. This is one of several exercises where it is easy to form it 
into a mechanical habit and thus it permanently looses its power.

ARMS UP AND VOCALIZE 

This is a slightly more advanced variant of the previous 
exercise. It can be more powerful and, in fact, can be too 
powerful for early use. 

This is an important point, so I will spend a few paragraphs 
discussing it. How often have I said it?

SELF-IMPROVEMENT IS NOT A RACE OR A CONTEST!!!



Chapter 16, Shoulders                        269
You definitely can overdo it. You can go too far too fast and 

the result will not be faster improvement, it will be damage. This 
is the ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY principle.

If you go too slowly, the worst than can happen is that you get 
bored. If you go too fast, you can, figuratively, blow emotional 
fuses. You can overload your system and it will respond by 
shutting down even more rigidly than before. 

The human organism responds, and must respond, slowly. 
Like any skill or knowledge, we must get there slowly over time. 
As we grow, our brain changes. Using non-technical terms, our 
brain gets wired in a certain way. To change that requires time. 
Too rapid work does not undo the past bad wiring, it simply 
makes it stronger (in the wrong way). 

This exercise is done with normal breathing. The arms reach 
toward the ceiling and are held there. The fingers may be wiggled 
if that feels appropriate. On the inhale, while leaving the arms 
upright, relax the body. On the exhale vocalize whatever phrase 
seems to produce an emotive result. Some suggested phrases are: 

help me
please
why
mommy
daddy
I want you
I need you
when
help

If it feels appropriate, the hands may be bent (palms up to the 
ceiling) and simulate the idea that you are pushing against 
something. Then the phrases like: 

no
no I won’t
go away
stop



270 Reichian technique, Part Two

I hate you 
leave me alone

may seem appropriate.

Figure 117

There is no set phrase or word. Whatever at the moment seems 
as if it is what you want to say or express is then appropriate. In 
doing this exercise try to put some emotion, like an actor on a 
stage, into the words. Thus, for example, the word “stop” might 
be said with a pleading tone or with a demanding tone or a 
helpless tone. 

Let me say it once more: if the response is too strong or it 
starts to get away from you, stop the exercise. It is far better to 
miss an opportunity than to overdo it.



Chapter 17, Chest and diaphragm               271

CHAPTER 17

THE CHEST AND DIAPHRAGM

 THE CHEST 

I held off these two exercises from Part One of the book 
because you have enough there to keep you busy. Besides it gives 
me something to write about regarding the chest in Part Two.

COUGH EXHALE 

Coughing almost requires the use of the muscles between the 
ribs. Recall that proper inhale means use of the muscles between 
the ribs, not the muscles of the neck (the accessory muscles of 
respiration.)

By coughing repeatedly on the exhale you are using and thus 
freeing the muscles between the ribs. The best way to do this is to 
push the belly out before the exhale and then cough the exhale. 
You can use your hands on your abdomen to see that it does not 
contract (which would mean that you are trying to use your 
diaphragm to do the cough). 

Cough exhale
Sneeze



272 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 118

The only error on this exercise is to cough from the throat 
instead of the chest. Try to keep your throat open so that the 
sound, as it were, comes from the chest instead of the throat.

SNEEZE 

A sneeze is the ultimate user of the muscles between the ribs. 
Unfortunately there are only two good ways to bring on a sneeze. 
One is to use a feather brushing the nose, the other is the use of 
common household black pepper. Using a feather may not work 
if you are doing it to yourself, but if you have a helper (Chapter 
22) then use of a feather will usually work. But a little bit of 
common black pepper will always work. So use it. Just a little bit 
in the nose should bring on a good bout of sneezing. Lick the end 
of your finger, dip it in some pepper, and then place it into your 
nostril; both nostrils if needed. 

One thing, however. The sneeze should be as loud and 
explosive as you can make it. These are not polite sneezes. These 
are blow the wall down sneezes. If your sneezes are tiny or just a 
“ka chu” it only means that you have a lot of work to do on 
freeing those chest muscles. Go back to Part One and work more 
on the exercises to free the chest.



Chapter 17, Chest and diaphragm               273

 THE DIAPHRAGM 

The diaphragm is famous for expressing anxiety. If, while you 
are working on the chest, the diaphragm, or the abdomen, the 
anxiety gets to a level where it is interfering with your daily life, 
then work on the shoulders or on anger until the anxiety abates. 
Recall that in Part One I mentioned the thing we do with children 
when they are crying. We say “let me see a smile.” The smile 
overcomes the tears since they are opposite. Anger can overcome 
anxiety in the same way a smile overcomes tears.

Some people are anxious all the time or have attacks of 
anxiety. It is not part of the Reichian work so I will only discuss 
this on the last page of Chapter 22. There I give you two 
relatively easy ways to stop strong anxiety (or a panic attack). 

GASP INHALE BELLY 

I presented this exercise to you in Part One of the book in 
discussing breathing. But this exercise is also an exercise for the 
diaphragm and has, if done fully, a major effect on the pelvis.

There are a set of muscles in the pelvis in the inside of your 
body. These muscles, as a set, are called the pelvic diaphragm.

The only good way to impact the pelvic diaphragm (which has 
a significant effect on sexuality) is by the belly breathing. And 
the most impactful of these belly breathing exercises is the gasp 
inhale belly. Most people when they do the gasp inhale belly 
exercise still guard the abdomen and do not allow the full rapid 
inhale. They do learn to do a rapid inhale, but it is also an 
abbreviated inhale; that is, they do not inhale fully and thus the 
gasp does not get down to the pelvis.

There is a way to correct this. Making sure that the chest does 
not move (you can even tense the muscles in your chest to help 

Gasp inhale belly
Gag
Croak, hold an flick
Double croak, hold and flick



274 Reichian technique, Part Two

prevent movement), breathe into the belly and force more inhale 
until you can feel the air pushing against the pelvis (or the 
genitals). Then exhale fully. Now inhale again down into the 
pelvis and continue this until you become accustomed to the feel 
of the pressure going down to the pelvis.

Here is another helper. At what seems to you to be the end of 
the inhale to the belly, place one hand between the wings of the 
pelvis, just above the pubic bone, and then try to put air into that 
area so that you can feel the belly expand beneath your hand. If 
you really get the air down this far you will literally feel the 
pulling at the pubic bone (see Figure 118 on page 272). The two 
wings of the pelvis are held together only by a ligament at the 
pubic bone. Therefore as the air gets down to this area, it pushes 
the two wings apart and you can feel the pulling on that ligament.

Once you can get the air down to the pelvis and feel the pull 
on the pelvic ligament, then you can gradually speed up your 
inhale, holding all the time to the feel of the pressure going down 
to the pelvis. Finally, you can get to the gasp inhale belly and feel 
the impact of each gasp inhale in the pelvis.

I wish there were some way I could illustrate just how rapid 
the gasp is. Certainly the total inhale to the belly takes less than a 
half a second and likely about 1/4 of a second. One issue is that 
there should be no sound on the inhale. Most people when they 
try this exercise add a throat sound much like a rasp. Properly 
there is no inhale sound at all. The throat is open; it is just a pipe 
to the lungs so there is no sound at all except the extremely quiet 
sound of the rushing air. If you have any noticeable sound on 
your gasp inhale belly, then your inhale will be too slow since the 
partially closed throat is inhibiting the inrush of the air.

The absence of sound, of course, can not be put on the audio. 
What I have done is do some gasps with the throat sound 
followed by some gasps without the throat sound. 

GAG 

Gagging has already been discussed in Part One on the daily 
exercises. Gagging is one of the best diaphragm loosening 
exercises. You are referred to Part One on daily exercises (page 
50) for the discussion on the proper way to do the gag.



Chapter 17, Chest and diaphragm               275
If you have not been practicing the gagging on a regular basis, 

then you can do some work on it here. A good way is to first do 
the head over the bed exercise on page 230 and then do the 
gagging. The head over the bed exercise sometimes produces 
nausea and that makes it easier to do the gagging.

Note: you should not have eaten for at least three hours before 
you do any gagging. I don’t want there to be any food in the 
stomach.

Figure 119

When you were doing the daily gag in the shower, you did not 
need the bowl or the tissue. Here, use a bowl and tissue to blow 
your nose. Note that the person is sitting upright, not leaning into 
the gag. Recall that there are three ways to initiate a gag reflex 
(touch the throat at the back of the mouth, stimulating the uvula 
hanging down at the back of the mouth, pressing on the back of 
the tongue.)

CROAK HOLD AND FLICK 

This is a very useful exercise, but it is difficult to describe in 
words. I will do my best.



276 Reichian technique, Part Two

The inhale is about one-third to one-half of a full inhale. It is 
only to the chest. The belly is pulled in during the inhale (but it is 
not tensed). During the inhale you make a “croaking” sound.

Note that this is the first and only exercise during which a 
sound is made during the inhale. The croaking sound is the 
difficult to explain part, I will return to it after I complete the 
description of the exercise.

After the inhale you pause. As in other exercises, the duration 
of the pause is about the time it takes you to slowly say (in your 
head) the word “hold.” 

Then you start the exhale both with the normal ‘ah’ sound and 
with a flick of the belly. Important: the ‘ah’ sound is normal and 
the belly is flicked, not expanded. Later I will return to this issue 
of the flick.

Don’t speed up. Even though the inhale was only a 1/4 or 1/2 
inhale, still the exhale should be full. There is a strong tendency 
to abort the exhale so as to get to another croak inhale. This is not 
a fast exercise so give yourself time to exhale fully.

Don’t forget the hold. It is an important and integral part of the 
exercise. Of all the errors I see students making in this exercise, 
the failure to do the hold is the most common, even more 
common than making a sound other than the soft ‘ah’ and 
sticking out the belly rather than flicking it.

This exercise is extremely difficult to do correctly. It should 
be left until you are relatively advanced in the work. This 
exercise has a major effect on the diaphragm. In each session of 
work it should be done only as long as you are doing it correctly. 
During the learning period you might do only half a dozen 
executions and then go to another exercise. It is better to not do 
this exercise than it is to do it incorrectly. Once you form a bad-
execution habit it is hard to break. So learn to do it correctly and 
give yourself as many work sessions as needed to learn it and do 
it correctly.

First, the croak sound. The sound is made in the throat, so it is 
not like a wheeze. The best way I have of describing it is in 
movies you might have seen where someone was dying and 
gasping his final breaths. The most common error in this croak is 
that the sound is forced by tensing the throat muscles in an effort 
to force the sound. It is actually an easy sound to make and is a 



Chapter 17, Chest and diaphragm               277
very natural sound, almost the only one that can be made on an 
inhale. Just pretend to yourself that you very ill and are lying on 
your death bed. You are, with difficulty, inhaling your last 
breaths and you make a noise in your throat while inhaling these 
last breaths. If you can act out that scene, you will get a good idea 
of what the croak sounds like. You can hear examples of the 
croak sound on the Sounds of Reichian audio.

The second most frequent error in this exercise, even more 
frequent than a bad croak sound, is to stick out the belly rather 
than flick it. Here is a way to think about it. Rest you forearm on 
the arm of a chair with your hand on your belly. Now move your 
belly out and in slowly. Get the sense of that motion. How does it 
feel to your hand with the belly being expanded and contracted. 
Now, holding your hand on your belly, flick it out. Note that 
when you do that there is an automatic rebound so that your hand 
almost instantly returns to its starting position. That is the 
difference between a movement and a flick.

When you flick the belly it is a quick out and relax, much like 
the hand flick you just felt. The belly does not stay out for the 
exhale or even for any length of time. It is only flicked. 

The flick actually comes from the diaphragm not the 
abdominal muscles. Try to think of it not as pushing out the belly, 
but as flicking the diaphragm. That is, try to sense the motion as 
coming from the diaphragm at the base of the ribs rather than as 
coming from the upper abdomen.

Just to make it explicit, this exercise is impossible before you 
have freed the diaphragm. That means that the breathing 
exercises I discussed in Part One about the diaphragm in addition 
to the exercises I have presented here in Part Two must all be 
mastered before you can try this one.

After the exhale, the croak inhale, pause, and flick is repeated. 
Continue this for up to ten minutes or until you can no longer 
maintain the proper rhythm. 



278 Reichian technique, Part Two

DOUBLE CROAK HOLD AND FLICK 

Don’t even think of doing this until you have fully mastered 
the normal croak hold and flick. You should be able to do a full 
10 minutes of the normal croak hold and flick without losing the 
croak or the flick before you even begin to think of doing this.

You already have learned the croak and starting the exhale 
with the soft ‘ah’ sound and a flick. Now you are going to learn 
to do a double flick.

Here is the sequence:

1. chest inhale of about 1/3 of a normal chest breath with the
    croak sound
2. start the exhale with a pause (hold) then a flick with the ‘ah’
    sound
3. do a second 1/3 inhale with the croak sound
4. do a second pause (hold) and flick with the ‘ah sound
5. continue to exhale to the normal end point
6. start again: small inhale croak, hold, flick, etc.

This exercise is impossible to do if the flick is an extending of 
the abdomen rather than a flick of the diaphragm. 

1. Inhale only to the chest, the belly is relaxed or pulled in
2. The inhale is about 1/3 of a normal inhale
3. During the inhale there is a “croak” sound
4. After the inhale there is a pause (about as long as it takes
     you to slowly say the word ‘hold’ in your head
5. The exhale is started with a flick of the belly and the 
     normal easy ‘ah’ sound
6. The flick is a very quick out and relax, the belly is not 

 held out; it is immediately returned to its relaxed state.
7. Common errors:
     a. no hold
     b. not a flick of the diaphragm, rather it is a stick out and
          pull back of the belly
     c. bad or missing croak sound
     d. breath is too much or too little



Chapter 18, The abdomen          279

CHAPTER 18

THE ABDOMEN

INTRODUCTION

When I started to write this book on the Reichian therapy 
exercises, one problem I faced was how to organize the material. 
In what order should I present the material? As you see, my 
decision was to present the daily exercises and the breathing in 
Part One of this book and then to cover everything else in the 
second part by going part by part from the forehead to the legs. 

This provided us with a kind of logic of presentation, but it 
also left unaddressed an important issue. The issue is: despite the 
order of presentation, what is the proper order of execution. Now 
in part that is unanswerable since people are different. One 
person can have significant tension in the forehead and the eyes 
while the next person has almost no tension there. By a like 
measure, though the author has never seen someone who did not 
have some tension in the abdomen, still the degree of tension can 
vary greatly. The same is true of the chest. People with the long 
thin chest take a lot longer to get it up than people with the high-
held barrel chest take to get it down. 

In presenting this exercise I would like, for the first time, to 
draw a distinction between being able to breathe fully into the 
belly and having the belly be relaxed. In drawing this distinction I 
would first recall for you that when you are lying on the bed in 
the working position the abdominal muscles have no postural 

INTRODUCTION
ROLL THE PELVIS



280 Reichian technique, Part Two
function. That is, the abdomen should be able to relax in the 
working position and become relatively soft. 

There is one and only one big exercises to loosen the 
abdomen. It is a “big” exercise because it, all by itself, will over 
time produce profound loosening of the abdominal muscles (in 
the non-postural position). This exercise can (and should) be 
begun early in the work while doing the breathing work, but 
whenever it is begun it will both do its job of loosening the 
abdominal muscles and allowing the breath to go more deeply 
into the abdomen.

What happens if you have spent all your time on Part One 
before you started the work in Part Two? No harm has been done. 
The issue is that if your abdomen is tense you will not be able to 
effectively do the breathe belly only and not at all the gasp inhale 
belly. Further it is more difficult to free the diaphragm if the 
abdomen is overly tense. It is further evident, as you continued to 
read through this book, that you certainly could not do the croak 
hold and flick if the abdomen were tight. 

Anatomically there are only three areas for the abdomen: the 
front (taken care of here by roll the pelvis), the side (taken care of 
by the side bend exercise discussed starting at page 122) and the 
lower back which will be addressed in the next chapter on the 
pelvis.

That makes this exercise an extremely important one. It is this 
exercise that, after enough time, will result in loosening your 
abdomen. 

Recall in this connection the section I had in Part One on gym 
exercise. I pointed out there that few repetitions against heavy 
weight will build tension which defeats this work while many 
repetitions against light weight builds tonus and definition. Now 
if you are doing full sit-ups (with the legs extended and lifting 
your whole torso with your abdominal muscles) then you are 
doing repetitions against a heavy weight (it does not matter if you 
are so good at it that you can do five hundred sit-ups, you are still 
working against a heavy weight). If, on the other hand, you have 
your knees bent and you are coming up only part way (a curl), 
that is no problem for this work. 



Chapter 18, The abdomen          281
This is a good point to remind you of something I mentioned 

in Chapter one. “Armor” tends to return. If you have previously 
cleared the forehead and eyes as I recommended and now you 
have spent several months on other parts of the body, it is a good 
idea to return to check on whether your eyes are still free of 
“armor.” The same goes for the face, tongue, jaw, and shoulders.

ROLL THE PELVIS

In Part One I mentioned this motion of rolling the pelvis in the 
push exhale exercise. But I did not present this exercise by itself 
in Part One. I would have liked to since it so important an 
exercise, but it just did not fit the breathing focus of Part One of 
the book. Now finally, I can present this exercise on its own. It is 
really quite a critical exercise since it is the one and only exercise 
we have for getting the frontal abdominal muscle (the rectus 
abdominis) to let go of any held tension. 

At the beginning of the exhale, with the ‘ah’ sound, roll the 
pelvis. Hold it up for the whole exhale, then lower it as the 
exercise ends. 

Each one of those motions is a location of error in doing this 
exercise. Note that 

1. the ‘ah’ is with the roll
2. the pelvis is held up for the whole exhale
3. the pelvis is lowered (not dropped) at the end of

the exhale; not after the end of the exhale, but at
the end of the exhale.

Since the ‘ah’ sound is short you can’t really complete the roll 
at the same time as the sound. The point is that the roll starts at 
the same time as the beginning of the exhale and is completed 
quickly. The roll, however, is not abrupt; it is not a jerk or a toss. 
The motion of the pelvis should be quick but fluid.



282 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 120

There are several common errors in this exercise. 
The first error is that the rolling of the pelvis is done after the 

‘ah’ sound rather than with the ‘ah’ sound. The roll should be 
done at the start of the exhale which is the same time as the ‘ah’ 
sound is made.

The second error is that the lower back is raised instead of the 
roll being limited to the pelvis. To show this, I have reproduced 
Figure 120 as Figure 121 left panel, along side a photograph 
where the back is rolled up (Figure 121 right panel).

Figure 121

The third error is that the pelvis is not held up for the complete 
exhale. In this connection there is another small issue. Just as 
there is the tendency to roll the pelvis after the ‘ah’ sound rather 
that with the ‘ah’, so, too, there is a tendency to lower the pelvis 



Chapter 18, The abdomen          283

after the end of the exhale rather then with or at the end of the 
exhale.

The fourth error is that the pelvis is dropped rather than 
lowered.

The fifth error is that the roll is done with the abdominal 
muscles rather than with the thigh muscles, or the roll is done by 
spreading the legs to use the interior thigh muscles. This is shown 
in Figure 122 on page 283. In the left side photograph, the pelvis 
is rolled using the legs muscles (the quadriceps femoris). In the 
right side photograph, the pelvis is rolled by tensing the 
abdominal muscle (the rectus abdominis).

Figure 122

The next figure shows rolling the pelvis by spreading the legs. 
On the left is the normal spread of the legs, on the right the legs 
have separated in order to roll the pelvis.

Figure 123



284 Reichian technique, Part Two
You might recall that I spoke about having to concentrate on 

each movement. There is no better exercise than this one to learn 
to trust your body. Initially you will have to focus on each 
motion:

Once you have it down at the concentrate level, then you 
should focus on the feel of the body while doing the motion 
properly. In time you can let the body do the work without you 
having to focus on it. You simply have the feel of the body and it 
is the feel that you replicate with each breath rather than the 
specific motions.

There is an analogy here. At one time when you were tiny you 
had to learn to walk and climb stairs without falling. Now you do 
both things without thinking about your legs and feet. So, too, 
here you should learn to let the body movement be automatic 
without the need to control each movement. 

This exercise can be profitably done for a complete one-hour 
session (or as long as you make your sessions). Further, even 
though it might seem boring, this exercise can be profitably done 
for many months, week after week (or, if you are doing sessions 
every third day, for many month’s worth of sessions).

You can judge your progress by pressing your fingers into 
your abdomen. Your fingers should be able to go in several 
inches without pain and without significant resistance.

1. roll with the ‘ah’ sound
2. hold the pelvis up for the whole exhale
3. lower the pelvis (not drop) at the end of the exhale



Chapter 19, Pelvis                 285

CHAPTER 19

THE PELVIS

Except for the first exercise (roll the pelvis) these exercises are 
a little more advanced. It is best if you have the breathing down 
fairly well. You should fully have cleared up the forehead and the 
eyes before you work on these exercises. Not surprisingly these 
exercises will have a major effect on your sexuality.

ROLL THE PELVIS

This exercise has already been presented in Chapter 18 on the 
abdomen. In addition to its major value in loosening the chronic 
tension in the abdomen, this exercise also frees up the pelvis so 
mention of it is repeated here.

TOSS THE PELVIS

You have to have mastered the roll the pelvis exercise before 
you go to this exercise. In this exercise you are in the normal 
working position, on your back.

Recall that in the roll the pelvis exercise, you rolled up on the 
‘ah’ sound and rolled down at the end of the exhale. Here the roll 

1.  Roll the pelvis
2.  Toss the pelvis
3.  Roll the pelvis (stomach)
4.  Slam the pelvis (stomach)
5.  coin in the ass



286 Reichian technique, Part Two

is replaced by an energetic and rapid toss up (instead of a roll up). 
The soft ‘ah’ sound is usually replaced here by a more vigorous, 
almost shouted, ‘ah’ sound. You can also, after getting 
accustomed to this exercise, replace the ‘ah’ sound with a shout. 

Treat your pelvis as though it were a battering ram that was 
breaking against a wall or think of a person driving spikes into a 
railroad tie. The toss is hard, fast, and energetic. The toss is not 
merely rapid, it is also energetic or violent. However, it is still 
just the pelvis that moves. Your back should not lift off the bed. It 
is the pelvis that is being tossed, not the lower body. Also 
remember that the roll and thus the toss is done by the thigh 
muscles not the abdominal muscle and not by spreading the legs.

ROLL THE PELVIS (STOMACH)

Here, for the first time, your are lying on your stomach rather 
than your back. Also the order of movement of the pelvis is the 
opposite of what you have been doing in the roll the pelvis 
exercise. Here is where we complete the work on the abdominal 
area. 

The movement is done on the inhale rather than the exhale. On 
the inhale (normal belly then chest), lift the pelvis off the bed by 
arching the back. As you can see from Figure 124, the only 
movement is with the pelvis. 

The arching of the back does not take long — perhaps 1/4 of 
the total inhale time — however it is not a jerky movement. The 
pelvis is lifted off the bed, it is not jerked off the bed.



Chapter 19, Pelvis                 287

Figure 124

The abdomen does not lift off the bed except as it follows the 
pelvis. At the end of the exhale, drop the pelvis. This is not a 
controlled roll-the-pelvis-back, it is a drop-the-pelvis-back to the 
bed. 

The common error here is lifting the body while arching the 
back instead of only arching the back. This is shown in the next 
figure. The model is, at my direction, putting his hands under his 
body to better illustrate the difference. You can compare Figure 
124 to Figure 125 to see the difference.

You need to master this exercise before you go on to the next 
one.



288 Reichian technique, Part Two

SLAM THE PELVIS (STOMACH)

This exercise is difficult to do properly. Again you are on your 
stomach. 

The motion is the same as the roll the pelvis (stomach). That is 
at the start of the inhale you arch the back lifting the pelvis off the 
bed. However, here instead of dropping the pelvis at the 
beginning of the exhale, you slam the pelvis against the bed with 
as much violence as you can muster. The sound changes from an 
‘ah’ to a shout (usually ‘uh’ or ‘huh’). 

Again, think of your pelvis as a hammer or a metal stamping 
machine. You are trying to break the bed with your pelvis. The 
motion is quick and violent. 

A common error here is that even though you have practiced 
the roll the pelvis (stomach) so that it is only the pelvis that 
moves and not the lower body (with the abdomen off the bed), 
once the vehemence of the slam is introduced then the lower 
body is brought into play. The only movement should be in the 
pelvis. You can use a hand under your body about half way 
between the belly button and the pubic area to insure that you are 
using only the pelvis and not the lower body.

This exercise is designed to elicit any emotion associated with 
the pelvis. Contrary what you may have read in Reich or Lowen 
or other theorists, there is little to no correlation between a given 
emotion and a given body area. Recall that psychology is a 
statistical discipline, therefore Reich’s flat statement that the 
pelvis “holds” rage and Lowen’s statement that the scalenus 
“hold” tears are unsupportable. One can say, as I did on page 273, 
that “the diaphragm is famous for anxiety” but one can not say as 
an assertion of fact that ‘the diaphragm holds anxiety.’ The pelvic 
work can elicit anger, fear, stubbornness, self-control, etc. or 
even no emotion at all. Even if you can’t directly feel any 
feelings in the pelvis when you do the exercise, it will still be 
doing its work. Just, as always, keep doing the exercise session 
after session and let your dreams take care of the effects of the 
work on your character.



Chapter 19, Pelvis                 289

COIN IN THE ASS

This exercise is done in the normal working position. Pretend 
that your buttocks has a coin held between the cheeks. On the 
inhale, tense the gluteal muscles to hold the imagined coin. On 
the exhale relax the gluteal muscles. 

That is all there is to the exercise. It seems simple and it is 
except that the effects are significant. Give it time to do its work. 
As simple as this exercise sounds, it is very powerful in its 
effects. It is better if you hold off on this exercise until you have a 
few years of the doing this work under your hat.

CHAPTER 20

THE LEGS

It is quite surprising how much of one’s nature is held in the 
legs. 

Many of you are doing exercises which involve the legs, like 
jogging, running, stationary bicycle, stair climbing and others. 

There are two paradoxes in these exercises. One is that while 
you are doing these exercises for your health, they tend to wear 
out the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The other paradox is that these 
same exercises can also result in chronic tension in the leg 
muscles, the opposite of what we want.

If you want to exercise your legs, the best way is by a nice 
brisk walk each day. There are two benefits to this way of 
exercising the legs (and heart). First, it does as good a job as 
jogging or bicycling and two, it does not result in the degree of 
injury to the ankle, knee and hip.

That said, I want to emphasize that I am not playing parent 
here. One purpose of Reichian therapy is to get rid of the demand 
rigidity in your nature and your life. So I am not laying down any 
new rigid demands on you life. I am only giving you something 
to think about.

1.  Swim kick
2.  Legs open and close
3.  Kick with the legs (swim kick)
4.  Slam kick fast
5.  Slam kick slow



292 Reichian technique, Part Two

KICK WITH THE LEGS (SWIM KICK) 

In Part One I spoke of the spasms that may result from the 
deep breathing. I mentioned there that a calcium & magnesium 
supplement might take care of the problem or that use of the 
swim kick can often take care of the issue. To make sure that 
there is no confusion, I am talking here about the strong and often 
painful spasms that can occur during the work, I am not talking 
about the trembling or jerking.

I have no good science as to why the swim kick exercise can 
work to permanently get rid of the spasms that can result from the 
deep breathing (i.e. the hyperventilation). But it often does work, 
so I will just leave it at that. 

Lying on your back in the normal working posture, extend 
your legs so they are flat against the bed. Now, as your breathing 
continues, alternately lift a leg and bring it down against the bed. 
Do not bend the knee as you raise the leg, the knee is locked. The 
distance raised is about 12 inches. This distance is not something 
to measure, it is presented here only to give you an idea of how 
much the legs are raised. The speed is about 60-70 kicks per 
minute. This speed is just to give you some idea, it is not a 
requirement. A way to think about it is that breathing is about 12 
breaths per minute so this is five to six kicks per breath. 

Figure 126

Do not try to coordinate the kicking and the breathing. 
Breathing should continue at the same speed and depth as before 
you started kicking the legs. Also do not try to count the kicks per 



Chapter 20, Legs                        293
breath. The two actions: breathing and kicking, are independent. I 
am only trying to give you some idea of the speed. 

There are two reasons to do the swim kick exercise. The two 
reasons are: (1) to get rid of spasms in the body that come with 
the breathing and (2) as a regular exercise as part of the Reichian 
work.

In using the swim kick exercise for purpose (1) [to get rid of 
spasms] continue the exercise for as long as you conceivably can. 
Most people tire after five to ten minutes of this exercise. Don’t 
let yourself stop. Keep going in spite of the exhaustion. If you 
can possibly do so, keep going for 50 minutes. Since this exercise 
will either permanently get rid of the tendency to spasms or it 
will not work at all, then only one session of this long use of the 
exercise is needed. 

In using the swim kick exercise for purpose (2) [part of the 
regular exercise set] it is usually done for only 10 to 15 minutes. 

There is one caution with this exercise and not everyone can 
do this. The caution is to try to not tense the abdomen during the 
exercise. The abdominal muscle are not needed to raise the legs 
and thus they should not be used. If you find that you cannot let 
your abdominal muscles relax while doing the exercise then treat 
that caution as a goal. As you loosen up the abdominal muscles 
you can measure your progress by doing this exercise to see if 
you can do it without tensing the abdominal muscles.

LEGS OPEN AND CLOSE 

This is the main leg exercise. The student is, however, warned 
that it works very slowly. That is, it takes months of use to show 
its effects. Don’t be discouraged. Just keep going. The exercise 
will do its job even if you do not directly see the progress.

We start by referring back to the basic working position. 
Lying on your back with your arms at your side, elbows slightly 
bent, your legs are bent so that the feet are flat on the bed. 
Moreover the feet are apart in line with the hip joint. The feet are 
as close to the buttocks as you can get them (without strain).

Now move the legs so that the ankles are touching and the feet 
are in the middle of the buttocks. 



294 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 127

On the exhale let the legs flop open. On the inhale bring the 
legs slowly up to the center where they touch. The raising of the 
legs should occupy the whole of the inhale. That is, the legs start 
up at the beginning of the exhale and the legs are not fully up 
until the end of the exhale. The breathing rate here is a little 
slower than is the normal body work breathing. This is done so 
that the period of raising the legs during the inhale does not have 
to be rushed.

The left photograph in Figure 128 shows the legs flopped 
open. The right photograph shows them coming up during the 
inhale. 

Figure 128

EXHALE → FLOP            INHALE → RAISE



Chapter 20, Legs                        295
What is not apparent in the left photograph without my 

pointing it out is that this model shows significant character-
based tension in his thigh adductors. An adductor muscle is one 
that draws parts of the body together. To close the legs, as in the 
right photograph, requires use of the thigh adductors. If our 
model’s adductor muscles were not chronically tense, his legs 
would flop all the way open to rest on the bed instead of going 
only about half way down.

There are a host of errors in this exercise, all of which render it 
less effective.

First, errors in the breathing. Many people switch to a shallow 
breath when they do this exercise. The breath should be just as 
deep and just as rhythmic during this exercise as it was before the 
exercise started. 

                              *    *    *    *

Just to remind you of what was discussed in Part One of this 
book about rhythm, ideally the breath should be like a pendulum. 
The exhale brings on the inhale which brings on the exhale which 
brings on the inhale which.... Most people — in my experience 
all people — breathe as a two step process. First they inhale, 
pause ever so slightly, then exhale. You might recall from Part 
One that rhythmic breathing was the final goal of the breathing 
work. After learning to breathe belly-then-chest on inhale and 
exhale, and learning to fill the lungs fully both with the 
diaphragm (belly breathing) and the muscles between the ribs 
(the intercostal muscles), and learning to be able to breathe only 
with the chest or only with the belly, and learning to do the gasp 
inhale and gasp exhale breathing; then we went to learning 
rhythmic breathing.

                              *    *    *    *

Next, still in breathing, some people change to a chest only 
breathing so that they can keep the abdomen tense as the legs 
open and close. The belly should not tense and the breathing 
should be full (belly then chest).



296 Reichian technique, Part Two

The most common error in raising the legs is that (a) either the 
legs are raised rapidly instead of slowly or (b) the first ½ to ¾ of 
the raising is done rapidly and then the last ¼ to ½ is done extra 
slowly to use up the inhale time. 

The movement of the legs (from the open to the closed 
position, or from the down to the up position, you can look at it 
either way) is done during the whole of the inhale. Since the 
inhale during the exercise should not have changed from the 
pattern before starting the exercise (except that the complete 
breath cycle is a bit slower), then the legs should not be together 
before the inhale has finished. The effort at learning to get the leg 
movement coordinated with the breathing will pay off. 

The other common error is to have a rapid leg movement 
during part of the inhale, then an extra slow movement to match 
to the breathing. It may be difficult for you, when you are 
working on this exercise, to feel the movement of your legs. It is 
OK to put a pillow under your head so that you can, while your 
head is lying against the pillow, see your leg movement and that 
it is moving at a constant speed. 

It has not been my practice in this book to tell you about 
performance criteria for the exercises except to discuss common 
errors. Here I do want to mention a measurement criterion. With 
your feet together and your legs flopped open, your goal is to 
have your knee be against the bed. Don’t get concerned if your 
knee is initially way up. The knee-against-the-bed is a goal not a 
requirement. 

 KICK WITH THE LEGS 

On the inhale draw both legs up against your body. Start the 
exhale with a shout and kicking the legs straight down the bed. 
Finish the exhale normally.



Chapter 20, Legs                        297

Figure 129

This exercise sounds easy and is easy except for the errors that 
are commonly made.

Breathing

Often the breathing is abbreviated because of the focus on the 
legs. The student spends his thought on the coming kick and in 
doing so shortens the inhale so that he can get to the shout and 
kick on the exhale. 

The inhale should be a full normal inhale. The legs are drawn 
up during the inhale but it does not matter if you bring the legs up 
slowly during the whole of the inhale or rapidly at the beginning 
of the inhale. 

Kicking

The common error on this exercise is that the kick is up and 
out rather than only out. What do I mean by that?

In Figure 130 on page 298 the photograph on the left shows 
the legs going up and out while the photograph on the right 
shows the legs only going out. On the left, if you could draw a 
line in space to follow the feet as they moved the line would look 
something like the shell of an elongated egg. 



298 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 130

This movement of the legs is difficult for most people to get 
so just do your best. The problem is that it is difficult to feel if 
your legs are going up and out as opposed to just out. 

The exercise is not wasted if the legs do go up and out, it is 
just not as effective that way. 

Remember that the exhale starts with a shout. This shout is 
one of vehemence as opposed to anger. You might think of the 
sound as the kind of sound one makes if one is swinging a sledge 
hammer. The shout is usually done with an ‘ha’ sound as opposed 
to the ‘ah’ normal exhale sound, but again that is not a critical 
element of the exercise.

SLAM KICK (FAST) 

This exercise is very similar to the swim kick. Again the 
breathing and the leg movement are independent of each other. 
The speed, however, of the slam kick is slightly slower than the 
swim kick. If the swim kick is about 60 per minute, this is about 
40 per minute. This slower speed is so that each slam is deliberate 
and has all the vehemence in it that you can muster. 



Chapter 20, Legs                        299

Figure 131

Here the leg is lifted about 2 feet above the bed and then is 
slammed down (hard and vehement) rather than dropped as in the 
swim kick. Think of each slam as though you were trying to 
break the bed with your foot and leg. The knees are still locked so 
that it is a straight leg raising and a straight leg slamming. 

If you have the impulse to do it, you can change the ‘ah’ sound 
to something more forceful. This change of sound is used only 
when it seems to be natural and appropriate. Don’t force it. Also 
recognize that you are doing several slams per exhale so there are 
several forceful sounds per single exhale. If you find that you 
can’t do that, then it is all right to do one slam per small inhale. 

This exercise can bring on significant feelings of anger, 
resentment, rage, futility, or anxiety33. These feelings are OK, 
except don’t push it. We are not after feelings for their own sake. 
We are after change in your character. It is better to stop the 
exercise too soon than to let it run too long. If some anger, for 
example, is still tied to the legs there is no harm. It will still be 
there the next time. Neither the presence nor the absence of any 
feeling is any indicator of progress. Whether any feeling arises or 
does not arise, the exercise is still doing its work.

33.To repeat, the relationship of an emotion to a part of the body is 
only statistical. That means the emotion(s) is only more common 
in that part of the body but need not be there and any other emo-
tion can be psychologically related to that body part.



300 Reichian technique, Part Two

SLAM KICK (SLOW) 

There are several major differences between this exercise and 
the slam kick fast exercise. 

First, here the leg is brought all the way up. If you are not 
limber, you may be able to come up only to about 60 degrees. If 
you are hyper-limber you may be able to bring you legs up to 
well over 90 degrees to the body. For this exercise, 90 degree is 
enough if you can do that.

Figure 132

It is not easy, nor is it a major issue, but try to raise the one leg 
without pressing the other leg into the bed. We tend to press the 
un-raised leg into the bed in order to tense the abdominal 
muscles. But we want this exercise to use only the quadriceps 
muscles of the leg and so tensing the abdomen is inappropriate. 

Next, the raising is done with the inhale. It is not a slow raise 
nor is it a jerk. Simply raise the legs up as you inhale and 
continue to do the full inhale. Since this leg raise and slam is 
done with the breathing, its speed is the normal approximately 12 
breaths (slams) per minute. 

Start the exhale with a shout and as you shout slam the raised 
legs against the bed as though to break the bed. The more 
vehemence the better. 

If it feels right, you can speed up the breath/slam sequence. 
Here the breath would be shallow (due to the speed) but the shout 
and kick should be no less violent. 



Chapter 20, Legs                        301
This exercise can be rapidly tiring so only continue as long as 

it feels productive. When you are first starting to do this exercise 
it will feel mechanical, just an exercise. As you learn to deal with 
anger, bitterness, resentment, etc. this exercise will become more 
productive. As with all the work, don’t overdo it. Continue only 
to tolerance or only as long as it is being productive.



302 Reichian technique, Part Two



Chapter 21, General exercises                303

CHAPTER 21

GENERAL EXERCISES

These exercises are general, not directed to a specific area of 
the body.

THE TENNIS RACKET

The goal of this exercise is to practice anger in a controlled 
environment. To recall a previous discussion, while sex used to 
be the great taboo, now it is anger. In all too many people, anger 
evokes strong anxiety. The anxiety then serves to keep the anger 
in check, just as smiling keeps tears in check. 

The common equipment for this exercise is a cheap wooden 
tennis racket. The cheaper the better. It is not that the racket is 
frequently broken — I have been using a $5.00 racket for 35 
years and it has yet to break — it is only that you do not want to 
be concerned when using it that you might have to go easy on it 
lest it have to be replaced.

Before describing the exercise, I would add that there are 
several alternatives to the tennis racket. The other pieces of 
equipment do yield different results but the difference is slight 

THE TENNIS RACKET

SENSE, FEEL, REPORT — VARIATION ONE

     variation two — way three



304 Reichian technique, Part Two

enough that just the racket is sufficient for most work. The other 
possibilities are an approximately two-foot length of flexible 
polyethylene tubing or a phone book.

Here you are standing during the exercise. The tennis racket is 
held with both hands. It is brought up over your head and then 
slammed against the bed with a shout. The face of flat side of the 
racket is what strikes the bed. Whereas before we tried to insure 
that the shout was with an open throat, here the only issue is that 
the shout be done with maximum vigor, vehemence or anger as 
you can muster. This exercise only works if you put your full 
force into it and you shout as strongly and loudly as possible as 
you bring the tennis racket down to strike the bed. 

There is always the possibility that you are so tall that 
standing and adding the length of the racket will cause it to strike 
the ceiling or a light fixture. Test this out first before you break 
something.

Most people tire quickly with this exercise so when you start 
to weaken in your slam or shout, stop the exercise for this 
session.

Interestingly, most people have more ability to do a hard slam 
than they do to add the vehemence to their shout. The shout is 
weak, it does not carry with it the rage that it should. Obviously, 
if you live in an apartment where the walls are thin, you have to 
do this only when you know that your neighbors are not home or 
you have to let them know beforehand that your shouting does 
not have any criminal meaning. It is somewhat disconcerting to 
have the police show up at your door because of a report that 
someone was being killed.

The rubber tubing can be substituted for the tennis racket or 
the phone book can be substituted where the book is ripped apart 
rather than used to strike.

SENSE, FEEL, REPORT (PASSIVE SESSION)

In Part One I said that each session should end with a sense- 
feel-report period. Here I make that into its own exercise. This is 
the passive session I mentioned at the beginning of Part One 
(Chapter one, page 26).



Chapter 21, General exercises                305
This exercise seems so simple that you may be tempted to try 

it early in your work; DON’T!
This exercise has immense power even though it appears to be 

almost benign. The power of this simple exercise is so great that 
the author has seen people thrown into full-blown anxiety after 
just a few minutes. On the other extreme I have seen people who 
were so guarded in life that the exercise had no effect at all and 
only served to help the student practice his nature of not being in 
touch with his body.

I would strongly urge anyone reading these books not to do 
this exercise for at least a year and then only when the forehead 
and eye exercises have done all their work.

Lie flat on the bed. The breathing is normal, no special need to 
breathe deeply and, as you will read in a moment, there is no ‘ah’ 
sound.

For one full hour talk out loud reporting on sensations from 
your body. It is critical for this exercise that you not let even a 
moment pass without saying something. If you have to, simply 
repeat the report you just made or simply use some vocal pause 
sound (uh, uh, uh …) to make sure that you never stop talking. It 
is important in this exercise to not allow yourself to fantasize. 
You have a specific point of focus: your body, and fantasy will 
take you away from that focus.

Don’t bother to set an alarm clock to measure the hour, simply 
do it for what you think must be an hour, then stop and check the 
clock afterwards. Don’t check the clock and restart the exercise 
to get in an hour. However long you do the exercise, that is the 
time that will be spent in this session.

A session might start with a full scan of your body. Here is a 
made-up example.

“My forehead is flat. My eyes seem stuck in the middle of my 
head. I can’t feel any tension in my jaw but there is a lot of saliva. 
My neck feels normal. There is a pressure on my chest as if there 
were a weight on it. I can feel the bed beneath my fingers and 
there seems to be a slight kind of tingle in my right wrist. My 
diaphragm feels a little like it is quivering. My abdomen feels 
empty as though there were a balloon inside it taking up the 
space. I am aware of my genitals. My thighs feel tight. There is a 



306 Reichian technique, Part Two

tingling in both knees. My right calf is tighter than my left calf. I 
can’t feel anything in my feet.”

Having gone over the whole body now you can do it again to 
see if there are any changes or you can focus on one thing (for 
example, the tingling in the knees) and see if and how the 
sensation changes. If you are focusing on one part of the body 
and it is not changing at all then leave that one part and turn to 
some other part or to a full body report.

It does not matter if you have nothing to report, it matters only 
that you do not let yourself stop talking and you continue to focus 
on the sensations from your body.

SENSE, FEEL, REPORT — VARIATION 1

34This is a more advanced version of this exercise. As such it 
should not be done until you have rung everything you can from 
the basic exercise.

34.A reader has informed  me that Christopher Hyatt (a nom de 
plume of Alan Miller) published a book prior to his death, suppos-
edly dealing with hypnosis but including my extensions to the 
sense and feel exercise. Alan had an early draft of this book and 
thus learned of my extensions to the usual Reichian sense-and-feel 
exercise. I am told, and I regard the report as valid because it is 
archtypical of Alan, that he did not include any warnings about 
use of this exercise. This I have added the above oval-box-warn-
ing in the hope that not too many people will be harmed by Alan’s 
cavalier lack of concern with any damage his writings might do.

Warning: these 2 vaiations of the sense and feel exer-
cises are very advanced and can do a great deal of 
psychologic damage if done too earily in the work. It 
is critical that you understand that memory is not 
accurate. It is not, like a movie camera, an accurate 
report of an event. It is a reconstruction: part may be 
orginal, a single memory may be made up from parts 
of events that might have happened years apart, and 
part entirely made up. Never accept a recovered 
memory as a true event. See:  Schacter (2001).



Chapter 21, General exercises                307
Now that you have done the basic exercise a number of times 

and are good at sensing your body, we are ready for this next 
step. Here, after sensing your body as normal, you pick an area of 
tension or other sensation and you start to manipulate the 
sensation.

If it is tingling, you may try to spread the tingling to more of 
the body. If it is tension you may try to increase the tension or 
you may try to relax that part of the body.

If you have a part of the body that has no sensation, is dead, 
try to put sensation into that part of the body (either tension or 
tingling). 

When you have modified an area of sensation, just watch it 
and report (never stop talking). Don’t forget issues like pleasant 
or unpleasant, scary or calming, hot or cold, alive or dead, light 
or heavy, etc. Just report everything you can sense, stay with the 
body, and never let yourself stop talking out loud.

SENSE, FEEL, REPORT — VARIATION 2

We come now to the last and most advanced-of-all exercise. 
In this one, to get the most out of it, you should have a tape 
recorder. The purpose of the tape recorder is so that you can be 
concerned only with your own body and feelings and memories 
and not be concerned with what you say. The tape recorder will 
capture what you say and you will listen to the tape after the 
session is over.

By the time you get here you have already done at least half a 
dozen simple ‘sense, feel, report’ sessions. You have also freed 
up at least your forehead and eyes. Now I am going to say that for 
this exercise, that degree of work is not sufficient. It is not that 
this exercise is dangerous unless you have freed more, it is that 
the exercise is wasted unless you have freed at least two other 
and better three other areas. The two other areas are the jaw and 
the neck. The third area is the abdomen.

Having reached that degree of work on your body tension, 
that, in turn, means that you have noticed a host of changes in 
your nature already and you are far more both emotional and at 
the same time far more able to control you emotions. I’ll amplify 
on that last one.



308 Reichian technique, Part Two

Throughout both parts of this book I have emphasized that the 
goal is to actually change your nature. I have further emphasized 
that feelings will arise during sessions and that they are to be 
allowed to have their expression without you either trying to get 
them or trying to suppress them.

At this late stage in our discussion I am going to introduce 
another change that is likely to have happened. Since this is not a 
book addressed to professional therapists or teachers I will not go 
through all the theory behind the change, I will simply tell you 
what it is. 

You probably heard all your life that feelings are irrational. 
But they are not! Feelings are as rational as all the rest of our 
being. But more important than their rationality is that they are 
subject to our will, that is they are subject to our conscious willed 
control.

Perhaps you can remember when you made a conscious 
decision not to allow expression of a given emotion or, similarly, 
when you made a conscious decision to make your breathing 
shallow or your shoulders rigidly pulled back. I recall clearly 
when I did it. I was nine years old. One day, crying in the park 
near my home, I decided that I was no longer going to respond to 
insults by crying. My technique was to go to the drinking 
fountain and start drinking from it. It is impossible to cry when 
you are drinking water. Within a short time I had my crying 
under control in general and the cry-problem was solved. 

At this point, pardon me, but one more short patient story. 
This fellow is, without doubt, the most extreme case I have ever 
seen of the translation of a conscious decision into a body state.

The patient was an engineer. He spent all his time — he 
usually worked seven days a week — inside a building without 
sunlight. Yet his face — but only down to his neck — did not feel 
like skin, it felt exactly like tanned leather. It was as though his 
facial skin had been so exposed to sunlight that it had changed 
from skin to leather. Not surprisingly, his face was the main area 
of my Reichian work. I never did fully soften his face, but it 
became soft enough that he recovered the memory of when it 
started.

He was about 10 years old. His father’s method of discipline 
was to beat him with a long round piece of wood (called, in the 



Chapter 21, General exercises                309
US, a dowel rod). On one occasion his father came after him and 
he hid under the dinning room table so that he would not receive 
the beating. As he cowered under that table, he made a decision 
that he would never smile again in his life. That decision, in time, 
converted his face from mobile skin to hardened leather; it was 
now impossible for him to smile, his thick facial skin, actually his 
facial leather, did not allow that kind of movement.

That’s a single example, but, you see, there is a much broader 
principle involved. That principle is that we can, in fact, control 
our emotions by willful choices. Sometimes that willful choice 
involves imposing other emotions and/or body actions; but that is 
only the technique, it is not the principle as such. 

The principle is that in the last analysis our emotions are under 
our volitional control. One of the changes in yourself that you 
should have noticed by now is that your emotions, when they 
occur, are (1) stronger, (2) purer and (3) more able to be 
controlled35. 

If you have not noticed that last point, that emotions are now 
more subject to your will, then take a few weeks and pay 
attention to that fact. I don’t mean that your emotions are now 
arbitrary or that you don’t sometimes have a mood that you can 
not seem to shake off; what I do mean is that when something 
happens to which you normally react with a given emotion or set 
of emotions (you will find below that feelings are seldom if ever 
singular, even though it may seem that you are feeling only a 
single one) that now you are much more able to set aside that 
emotion when it is not appropriate.

There is a simple way to illustrate this phenomenon. You have 
just been stopped by a policemen who is going to issue a traffic 

35.Repeating a footnote from Chapter one: Technically we use three 
different words: affect, emotion, and feeling. Affect is what occurs 
in the brain. It may or may not have any body expression. Emotion 
is what occurs when affect has a body effect. Feeling is the con-
scious recognition of an emotion or an affect. There can be affect 
with emotion; there can also be feeling without emotion. That is, it 
is not always necessary for there to be a body response to affect 
for there to be feeling. This latter condition is the norm when the 
spine is cut (as in quadriplegia) such that the person is unable to 
get any sensory data from the body. 



310 Reichian technique, Part Two

citation. Now there are two very common ways that people react 
to that impending traffic citation. One is anger and the other is 
self-pity. Obviously anger is inappropriate at least while the 
policeman is by your car in the traffic stop. That policeman has a 
gun, a night stick and mace. No matter what you may be feeling 
in the way of anger, it is not very clever to express it to the 
policeman. Likewise with self-pity. The policeman is not going 
to be influenced by your sad story and if your long-winded 
explanation annoys him you are only inviting him to give you a 
second citation.

So wisdom directs that you intentionally keep your emotions 
in check until the policeman is gone. If emotions were not subject 
to ones willful decisions you could not do that.

One of the great benefits of recognizing that you are able to 
control, to set aside, an emotion is that you now no longer have to 
fear them. Long ago in this book I mentioned that most people 
are terrified by their own anger. They don’t get angry as much as 
they get afraid (of their own anger reaction). But now, if you 
have come far enough in the work, you have seen that your anger 
or any other emotion (and the consequent feeling) is, on the 
whole, subject to your conscious decision. You can let the 
emotions be manifest in action or body state or you can suppress 
them. You no longer have to fear emotions because you have 
experienced that they are subject to your conscious decisions, 
you can let them have free rein and then stop them completely 
whenever you wish.

Now,  for this most advanced exercise, I am going to 
introduce another fact. That fact is that feelings are seldom 
singular, it is seldom the case that our body is manifesting only a 
single feeling. Feelings differ in intensity and the student, before 
doing the work or early in the work, is almost always incapable 
of recognizing (that is, naming) any more than the most intense 
feelings. But as you free body area after body area you become 
more and more able to sense and name ever more subtle feelings. 
Use half a dozen feelings as a rough guide. That is, at any one 
moment search for half a dozen ongoing feelings (body states). 

Above I spoke about fear as a reaction to anger. That is many 
people fear their own anger. That means that the fear and anger 
are both present at the same time. 



Chapter 21, General exercises                311
But, after all, the anger is not there for no reason. Maybe it is 

annoyance or frustration. That is a third feeling. But you are 
annoyed or frustrated about something. You are annoyed because 
someone interrupted what you were doing or you are frustrated 
because you were prevented from doing something you wanted 
to do. So that annoyance or frustration is mingled with feeling 
sorry for yourself. You have a fourth feeling.

But being interrupted or prevented from doing something 
means that the person who imposed on you does not understand 
you. You are feeling misunderstood and almost invisible; as 
though you do not matter. Now we have feelings five and six.

You get the idea. The more you become sensitive to yourself, 
the more you are able to identify all your mix of feelings. That 
ability will, in turn, effect your dreams which will change your 
nature.

Now we are going to make use of all these facts and abilities 
in this exercise. There are two different techniques (ways) 
presented here.

     Sense, Feel, Report  Variation 2 Way 1 

This exercise is designed to identify feelings. Use the tape 
recorder to monitor everything you say so that you do not have to 
be distracted from your main task in order to remember what you 
say. 

You already have learned to sense you body, including all the 
subtle experiences like tension or lightness or distance or various 
other sensations. Now the next step, putting an emotive-like 
name to each body experience.

I say “emotive like” because it is not necessarily an emotion. 
It might be an action-like phrase or a state-like phrase. Here are 
some examples. You feel tension in your calfs. Now you try to 
put a name to that tension. It could be the calf wants to run or it 
wants to play a game or it just wants to pull tight against your 
thigh (legs bent). For each and every one of those actions your 
calf seems to want to do you give it an emotive like name or 
description.

This issue is discussed at greater length in Chapter 23. There I 
will discuss in greater length this technique and the theory behind 



312 Reichian technique, Part Two

it. Here you are not doing it for just one obvious area of tension, 
you are looking everywhere in your body for any subtle 
sensation. 

Now the above example of the thigh is just one made-up 
example. You find your own areas of tension or lack of feeling 
around the body and come up with the best descriptions and/or 
names you can.

Now, as always, don’t rush the above. Don’t think that you are 
a super pupil because you are already at a more advanced level 
(because, in fact, you have slighted the prior level). The better 
you become at spotting and naming areas of activity or the 
complete absence of activity in a body area, the more you can 
make use of the next step.

OK, you have gotten fairly good at naming. Now add the next 
step. You identify the area of sensation, you name it, then you 
manipulate it. Recall that this variation two of  the sense, feel, 
report exercise involves being able to manipulate your body 
sensations. 

So now I add this ability to this variation 2, way 1. The major 
goal is still the same, naming. But now you are going to name the 
initial sensation and then modify it. You can modify it by 
increasing, decreasing, or moving it to another area of the body. 
Once you have changed the intensity or the location you are 
going to name it all over again. 

Here is another made-up example. You notice that your chest 
feels constricted, tight. You take that tightness and move it to 
your abdomen. Now it feels like disgust. You take that disgust 
and move it to your face. Now it feels like disdain. Now you go 
back to your chest to find that the tightness has become longing.

Don’t forget the point I made above. At any given moment 
there are about a half dozen ongoing emotions or desires in your 
body. Do one, name, manipulate and rename, then go on to a 
second one. If you can’t spot a second one immediately, simply 
rescan the whole body; but as always don’t for even a moment 
allow yourself to stop talking aloud.

     Sense, Feel, Report  Variation 2  Way 2



Chapter 21, General exercises                313
Get really good, really accomplished, at variation 2 – way 1 

before you undertake this next even more difficult technique. 
Here I draw on all the abilities you have developed so far and 

using those abilities we move to another step. Here you are going 
to employ, really allow, associations which you will report out 
loud and let the tape recorder save them for you.

What do I mean here by “associations?” I mean that any 
thought that happens to enter your mind while you are doing this 
exercise is followed and reported out loud. Caution: these 
thought are not, on the whole, practical issues (like how can I 
handle that task at work or what am I going to do about the kids), 
rather they are random thoughts started from sensing and/or 
manipulating your body and they seem to have no immediate 
relevance to your life.

For illustration purposes, I will provide an example here. All 
of this would have been said out loud to be recorded so that you 
can play back and analyze the material later.

“My right hand wants to ball up into a fist. What does it want 
to do. I don’t know. What does it want to do. It doesn’t so much 
want to make a fist as it just want to close the fingers against the 
top of the hand so that my hand is not open. Maybe I don’t want 
to shake hands. Let’s see what comes to mind. Yes, I recall when 
my father introduced me to some famous man and I just said ‘hi’ 
and my father later balled me out for not being more respectful. 
But I didn’t know. It was just another adult. How often have I 
been criticized for not acting some way when I did not even 
know I was supposed to act that way? Yes, it used to happen all 
the time. I was always wrong for doing things that I thought were 
proper and then I would get criticized for not doing it someone 
else’s way. I just though of my third grade teacher. She used to 
do that to me all the time and I felt so inadequate and so 
embarrassed that I tried not to do anything. Is that why my grades 
in school were not good? Maybe I started using that “hold back” 
way in all of school? I don’t know. It may be. But then I think of 
Justin. Justin always liked me. He didn’t tell me that I was doing 
things wrong. You know, it occurs to me in one way or another 
that all my life I have been trying to find other Justins. I have 
always sought approval and praise only because I assumed I was 
doing things wrong like daddy and the teacher said and I have 



314 Reichian technique, Part Two

always expected the criticism unless I got praise. Now I 
understand why I didn’t take that job, I thought I was too likely to 
make mistakes there and again it would be just like daddy baling 
me out for an error I didn’t even know I was making. …………”

That is free association. You allow your mind to go from one 
idea to another with no control or censorship. Whatever comes 
into your mind gets reported with your mouth and it is all 
recorded.

Then, after the session, you listen to the tape and now you 
have the time to reflect on what you have learned about yourself 
and your nature.



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             315

CHAPTER 22

WORKING WITH A HELPER

First a word about pressure. It is, on the whole, evident that 
males can take (and need) more pressure. Females can take (and 
need) less pressure.  

The purpose of pressure is to force a muscle to yield some of 
its held tension. When pressure is applied sometimes the worker 
and the helper can feel the muscle loosen. In other cases there 
will be no noticeable change but the effect will still be there 
(remember that most of the change occurs in the dreams). 

If a muscle is relaxed, then pressure feels only like pressure. If 
a muscle is tense, then pressure will produce pain. Pain is not the 
objective, it is an unfortunate side effect. I strongly point out 
that the use of pressure is not an excuse for a disguised sadism. 

Some theorists have held that all the work could be done with 
no pressure, it is only that it takes much longer to do its work if 
pressure is not used. I can not agree. The crucial area of the neck, 
if you use these muscle as accessory muscles of respiration, and 
the muscles of the back can not be corrected without the use of 
pressure. If you have to work without a helper to apply pressure, 
then you can but do what you can do without the pressure. You 
can, if you are able to, use self-pressure on the neck and then find 
a masseuse for pressure on the back, but other than that you will 
just have to settle for what you can do with all the rest of the 
work and just accept the limitations.

If the helper’s finger nails are short, then often the thumbs can 
be used for the pressure. If the helper’s finger nails will bite into 
the skin of the worker, then the use of the thumb is definitely 
counter-indicated. In the case of longer finger nails, then the 
knuckle of the first finger should be used.

I will in what follows, in examining each area of work, 
indicate where pressure can be used.



316 Reichian technique, Part Two

Here is a photograph showing how the knuckle can be braced 
with the thumb to make its use easier.

Figure 133

Here is a picture of the kind of device that may be purchased 
over the internet from message supply companies.

Figure 134

The next photograph is of the three pressure devices that I use 
in my practice. They look mean, but they are not. The three 
different sizes are labeled as to where on the body they are 
usually used. These devices are made from hardware-store 
purchased round wooden rods (dowel rod) and tips that, in the 
U.S., are called “crutch tips.” They are used on the end of canes, 



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             317
crutches, or furniture to keep the furniture from marring what is 
beneath it.

Figure 135

The major benefit of these pressure devices is that they allow 
for much longer pressure to be applied before my thumbs or 
fingers start to hurt. The disadvantage is that you loose the feel of 
the muscle that your hand provides. Therefore in practice I use 
both hand pressure and device pressure.

There is another issue. I will indicate in this chapter how the 
helper can tell the worker whether he (she) is or is not doing the 
exercise properly. However, this is not and should not be treated 
as permission to or an excuse to nag or criticize. Let’s take the 
eyes open and close exercise for the forehead. The helper might 
notice after just a few minutes that the forehead is no longer 
being wrinkled during the eyes open phase. At that point  a single 
statement “wrinkle the forehead on the inhale” is sufficient. If the 
worker again stops wrinkling the forehead after just a few more 
inhales, that means that the person is not able to do more at that 
time. Nothing is accomplished except implied criticism and 
demeaning the worker to point out again and again that the 
worker is not able to wrinkle the forehead for any extended series 
of inhales. The helper should simply let the exercise continue 



318 Reichian technique, Part Two

being done wrong and keep his (her) mouth shut unless the 
worker asks whether it is being done correctly. 

The same applies to the sound (except here more mentions of 
the issue can be made, but not to the point of criticism or 
belittling). If the worker appears to be trying, that is enough. On 
the whole it is better to let a mistake continue than it is to treat the 
session as a way for the helper to psychologically beat up the 
worker.

Finally, I also present here some exercises that can be done 
only with a helper. These new exercises will be noted as new and 
set off with the symbols I have used through out the books.

THE FOREHEAD

tonic eyes open
tonic eyes closed

The helper can be of use in two ways. One is to call the 
worker’s attention to the fact that the forehead is not wrinkling or 
that the eyes are only closed but not pressed tightly closed.

The second help is with pressure. There are several ways to 
apply pressure. They are shown in the following figure.



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             319

Figure 136

In the first two photos the fingers are moved back and forth 
across the forehead while pressing. If the helper’s finger nails 
prevent this type of pressure then photo three shows using the 
knuckle of the first finger as an alternate. The final shots shows 
other ways to use thumb pressure. Pressure in all cases, here and 
later, should be applied to the level of the worker’s tolerance. 
That is, use as much pressure as the worker is willing to tolerate. 
Start light and get stronger until the worker objects. To both 
males and females I add the same injunction: the more pressure 
you can tolerate, the better. That does not mean that the worker 
should be masochistic and treat the sessions as some kind of 
pain-endurance contest. Different muscles have different 
thickness and can tolerate more or less pain. Also there are major 
differences in the amount of tension that a muscle can hold and 
thus differences in the amount of pain produced with pressure. As 
an example, the muscles of the forehead are very thin and can not 
hold that much tension, thus they can usually (but not always) 



320 Reichian technique, Part Two

take more pressure. By contrast the muscles of the calf are very 
thick and dense. Pressure there is much more painful.

THE EYES

eyes open and close

The helper can point out if the open and close is not fully open 
or not fully closed or if the pattern diverges from the open on 
inhale, close on exhale. The remark should not be made no more 
than about two times. If the worker can not do better, then he 
(she) is doing the best he (she) can do at this time so further 
correction is simply criticism.

Since many people when they start this eye work soon tire and 
lose the ability to wrinkle the forehead or tightly close the eyes, 
the helper can tell the worker if it appears time to switch 
exercises. It is not bad practice in this exercise, or in fact with any 
exercise, that when performance falls off the exercise is stopped; 
normal Reichian breathing is done for 10 or 15 minutes; then the 
exercise is restarted for a second trial.

eyes in directions

All the helper needs to do here is watch that (1) the eyes go to 
the extreme end of all four direction (down, left, up, right); (2) 
that the eyes are not brought back to the center; (3) that the 
pattern is not lost. If there are any errors simply point it out once. 
The worker is doing the best he (she) can. No help is provided by 
frequent corrections.

roll the eyes

No corrections by the helper are needed here. Roll the eyes is 
difficult at first and it may take many sessions before the worker 
can do it properly and continuously (for 10 minutes). The helper 
can note if, in the roll, the eyes are not hitting the extreme angles. 
Then one statement to the worker can be made.

express feeling in the eyes



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             321

Here the helper can lean over the worker so that the worker 
has someone to focus the feeling on.

Figure 137

The helper’s role here can be tricky. Without going into the 
psychology of this, suffice it to say that the helper, in the 
worker’s eyes, becomes the parent (of the same sex) standing 
over the worker/child. That means that often emotions that one 
had as a child relative to that parent are facilitated by the helper 
standing over the worker as I am doing in Figure 137. That alone 
can be both a significant contribution and an impediment. 

As a contribution it aids the worker in re-creating those 
childhood emotions. As an impediment, the worker may be 
unwilling to deal with strong childhood emotions while they are 
seemingly directed to the helper.

This requires trust on the part of both worker and helper. The 
worker has to trust that the helper will not be injured by the 
expression of strong recreated childhood emotions and the helper 
has to trust that the emotions of the worker are recreations of 
childhood and not take the emotions as meaning anything in the 
present. 

As the worker expresses or attempts to express one emotion 
after another in the eyes (see the list on page 193), the helper can 
attempt to guess the emotion by the look in the eyes. 

Also, as a variant of this exercise, the helper can request 
particular emotions from the list on page 193 or the helper can 
add other suggested emotions.



322 Reichian technique, Part Two

bug eyes, skull eyes

No helper action needed.

PRESSURE

There is an area of pressure which can profitably be employed 
with the forehead exercises, the face exercises and the jaw 
exercises. This is shown in Figure 138. The hand on the forehead 
is only to brace the head. The pressure is applied to either of two 
places. 

Figure 138

One is the muscles at the base of the skull. Place your fingers 
at the back of the head and move downward to where there is a 
drop at the base of the skull. There are a series of muscles here 
from the middle of the neck all the way to the side of the neck.36

The other is in the middle of the neck as shown in the figure. 
There is only one significant muscle here (the trapezius) but it 
can take a lot of pressure and generally feels good rather than 
painful.

36.None of these muscles was mentioned when I was discussing the 
anatomy of the neck. In that discussion we were concerned with 
the accessory muscles of respiration. The many muscles which are 
at the base of the skull need not be named. It is sufficient to know 
that pressure all along the base of the skull is useful to this work.



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             323

THE PENCIL (NEW EXERCISE)

This exercises uses a common pencil with an eraser. You will 
use the eraser end, specifically the metal cylinder which holds the 
eraser. This metal cylinder is the point of focus.

Figure 139

While the worker continues the breathing, the helper stands 
behind the worker at the head end. Holding a pencil by the lead 
end, the pencil is moved about in a random and jerky manner. 

The idea is for the worker to follow the eraser/metal end of the 
pencil without moving his (her) head and while continuing the 
breathing. If the worker is frequently losing the focus, the 
movement can be slower until the worker is able to relax the 
control of his (her) eyes enough for them to follow the more rapid 
jerky movement.

At first do this for only a few minutes. At latter sessions the 
time can be extended gradually to a full 15 minutes.

THE FLASHLIGHT (NEW EXERCISE)

This exercise uses a pen light flashlight. When the batteries 
get low and the light is dull, replace the batteries. If it can be 
done, lower the lighting in the room to a very low level.



324 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 140

There is an error in Figure 140: the light is held too high in the 
photograph. It should be about eight inches above the head.

Initially, the light is moved around in a circle making sure that 
the light moves far enough in all directions that the eyes, to 
follow the light, have to move to the extreme positions of up, 
right, down, and left. The helper can see if the light is being 
followed correctly since the light will reflect from the pupil in the 
center of the eye. Also the helper should occasionally stop the 
movement to see if the worker’s eyes continue to move. Many 
people, if not perhaps most, instead of following the light, begin 
to anticipate where it will be and thus actually the eyes lead the 
light rather than follow it.  

When the worker has the circle down well (and the light can 
be moved  fairly rapidly), then the helper should start moving the 
light in jerky and random directions for the eyes to follow.

This exercise, like the pencil exercise, requires that the worker 
to be able to let go of conscious, controlled movement of the eyes 
and allow them simply to be controlled by pure stimulus.

THE FACE

move the face slowly

The only help here is to mention to the worker if he (she) is 
either moving rapidly instead of slowly or if the jaw is being used 
extensively rather than the facial muscles. With 22 muscles in the 



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             325
face, there are a lot of possible things that can be done with the 
lips, the mouth, the checks, the eyes and the forehead. Again, 
don’t nag or criticize. The worker is doing as best he (she) can. 
There is always another session.

smile inhale, frown exhale
blow through lips

Generally, no action by helper. However, if you look at Figure 
77 on page 200 you can see that our model is using his face to 
smile rather than just pulling the corners of the mouth up and he 
is nearly unable to pull the corners of his mouth down. Things 
like this can be pointed out without nagging.

shit on a stick

The helper can hold a hand mirror over the worker so that he 
(she) can see whether the nose is being wrinkled.

pout exhale
spread the nostrils

No action by helper. The helper can note whether the worker 
is or is not able to spread the nostrils. And if on a given breath it 
is done correctly, the worker can note that so the worker can get a 
feel for the face when the nostrils are flared.

the mirror look

Here the helper can hold a mirror over the worker. This is 
better than the worker having to hold the mirror. This is the not 
quite the same thing as above in the shit on a stick exercise. In the 
shit on a stick exercise the mirror is held fairly close to the face 
so that the focus can be on the bridge of the nose. Here the mirror 
is held away from the head at a level such that the full face can be 
seen in the mirror (but not so far that the trunk also is in view).

Let me hark back all the way to Chapter two, the daily 
exercises, where I explained that there were two ways to use the 



326 Reichian technique, Part Two

mirror. In the first way, the worker views the face as belonging to 
someone else. In the second way, the worker views the face as his 
(her) own. Either or both of these approaches can be used here. It 
all depends on which way works better in aiding the worker in 
expressing emotion in the eyes.

Figure 141

THE JAW

jaw left
jaw right

No action by the helper. In general if the worker is having 
problems with the jaw exercises, some pressure may be put on 
the jaw muscles (Figure 142). They can be quite painful so don’t 
overdo it. Mild pressure held for many minutes will do more than 
strong pressure.

Actually, there are, in most people, 22 muscles in the face and 
most all of them can use pressure work. Even though this chapter 
is devoted to the helper, it is also the case that the worker can 
apply pressure to the jaw (page 216). In Chapter 13 on the jaw, I 
made an issue of the direction of thrust of the worker when he 
(she) is working on his (her) own jaw. The issue of direction is 
less of an issue with the helper. The helper should use a direction 
of thrust which meets the most resistance or where the helper can 
feel the most tension. Since the mouth should be in the normal 



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             327
working position (fairly widely open as in Figure 142), the helper 
will not be pressing the muscle against the teeth. 

Three pressure points for the jaw muscles should be sufficient. 
The first one should be about one inch back from the mouth (that 
will get mainly the buccinator). The second will be about the 
middle of the jaw (the external masseter). The third will be near 
the back of the jaw but NOT ON BONE. To locate the spot, place 
your thumb next to the bottom of the ear and then come forward 
and downward until your thumb falls off the bone. That is the 
right place (the internal masseter). 

Figure 142

jaw back

This action is anatomically difficult. The helper can aid the 
worker by pushing LIGHTLY on the jaw. The joint of the jaw is 
very small and can be easily damaged by pressure; better too 
light than too heavy. Keep it light. I really mean that about keep it 
light. It is real pressure, it is not just patty-cake pressure; but the 
jaw joint is a very small joint and once it is damaged it does not 
repair. If the jaw joint is damaged it probably means surgery and 
often unsuccessful surgery. No kind of self-improvement work is 
worth damage to the jaw joint. I especially want to warn males 
about excess pressure. Men often do not realize quite how strong 
they are and so they need to be especially vigilant not to use 
excess pressure.



328 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 143

The arrow shows the direction of pressure. Just 20 or 30 
seconds is enough pressure for any given session.

jaw out

No action by helper except to see that the teeth are not 
clenched, that is the mouth is open and out. That is shown in 
JAW OUT on page 213. 

mouth open
 
If the mouth is really being stretched open, you will see a tiny 

muscle stand out at the side of the neck (see the arrow on the 
bottom left side photograph in Figure 86 on page 215).

If the helper does not see this muscle, he (she) can say “open 
wide, pull” a few times. But don’t overdo it such that you are 
perceived as being critical.

The helper can also use light pressure to force the jaw open. If 
there is any pain in the worker’s jaw joint, stop immediately the 
use of any pressure. Pain in the jaw muscles is not a problem, but 
again this is not an excuse for sadism on the part of the helper. 

Just as I have many times stated the rule: always too slowly; 
so there is the similar rule: always too light on the pressure. 
Better too light or no pressure at all than to overdo it. 



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             329
Also in Figure 144 note the two arrows pointing to the muscle 

(the omohyoideus muscle) that should stand out if the jaw is 
being fully pulled open.

Figure 144

clench teeth

Here the helper can be of major benefit. We have all seen a 
dog clamped on a piece of cloth while the owner moves it back 
and forth as though to pull it out of the dogs mouth.

The helper here is not pulling the towel side to side, but is 
rather lifting the towel so that the worker’s head is pulled off the 
bed.

Figure 145



330 Reichian technique, Part Two

THE TONGUE

lick the nose
lick the ceiling
lick the chin
tongue in directions

Here the only task of the helper is to call to the worker’s 
attention if (1) the tongue is not fully out (it has been allowed to 
relax) or (2) if the lower jaw is being used to push the tongue up 
(in the lick the nose exercise). Figure 146 shows the mouth being 
pushed open.

Figure 146

THE NECK

head to chest

This is not a hard exercise to do once the worker has a feeling 
for the movement of the head. If the worker is not able to get the 
head movement correct, then the helper can move the worker’s 



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             331
head the right way a few times until the worker has a feel for the 
correct movement. Other than that, no action by the helper is 
needed. If the helper sees that the worker is starting to just tuck 
the chin rather than bring it up and around, the helper can point 
that out.

head off bed, head to chest

The head over the bed exercise, bringing the head up and 
around to the chest, fairly quickly tires the neck muscles. If the 
worker does  this exercise to the point that the neck muscles are 
exhausted then the helper can lift the worker’s head while he 
(she) moves down on the bed so that the head will now rest on the 
bed.

As with the previous head to chest exercise, it the worker is 
lifting the head and tucking instead of coming up and around, this 
can be mentioned by the helper.

Mussolini jaw

Recall that this exercise is done one time, then there is a 
breathing-rest period, then it is done again, etc. The helper can 
point out if the sound is not a growl, if the shout is weak, or if the 
strike of the bed is weak. One caution: after a few repetitions of 
corrections by the helper, corrections should be stopped. If the 
helper continues to correct, it becomes nagging and criticizing.

roll the head

No action by helper needed.

PRESSURE

I have already discussed in Part One of the book how to use 
pressure in the neck area to help correct chronic tension. When 
the worker and helper get to the neck region it would be a good 
time to review the material on pressure in the neck region 
presented in Chapter nine (starting on page 162).



332 Reichian technique, Part Two

In this area, pressure can be very helpful and in some sense it 
is essential. The neck is a major area of conflict between feeling 
and thinking. It does not yield easily or rapidly only to the 
exercises.

The helper can greatly aid the worker in the area of the neck. 
The neck exercises can not do an adequate job of forcing the 
SCM, the scalenes, and the trapezius to let go of any held tension 
or to not be used as accessory muscles of respiration. 

THE SHOULDERS

roll the shoulders together front
roll the shoulders together back
tonic shrug the shoulders

The only helper action needed is to remark to the worker if the 
shoulders have relaxed. As always one or possibly two remarks 
are all that is appropriate. You are a helper not a critical parent.

The helper can point out if on the roll the shoulders back 
exercise the worker is arching the trunk. 

shrug up and throw down
shake the shoulders loose

The helper can point out if the arms or hands are being bent 
tending to make the shrug or the thrust come from the arms rather 
than the shoulders. The helper can also draw the worker’s 
attention to other errors like moving too fast or making a sound 
other than the normal soft ‘ah’ sound.

Let me recall to the helper some of the criteria mentioned in 
Chapter 16 when I was discussing the shoulder exercises. These 
issues (that is, avoiding these errors) applies to both of the above 
two exercises.



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             333

The helper can aid the worker by pointing out whether any of 
the above items is being violated. It is easy for me to see when 
the shrug, throw, or thrust is being done with the arms rather than 
the shoulder. I can’t say how obvious it will be to the helper, but 
at least the helper can try to see the difference. Similarly it is 
common for the worker to start speeding up (not taking time to 
say “pause” in his head) and thus lose the force of the movement. 
The helper should remind the worker to slow down.

arms up and hit
arms crossed and hit
choke the towel

No helper action needed. The helper can remind the worker of 
the need for vehemence in all three exercises. Since both the arms 
up and hit and the arms crossed and hit are done with a shout, the 
helper can listen for the shout sound and comment on when it is 
heard. It does no good to note the absence of the proper shout 
sound; as long as the worker is actually trying to get the shout 
sound, that is sufficient. 

reach with the hands
arms up and vocalize

1. The inhale is done during one shoulder movement
2. The exhale is continuous and does not stop to make the 

‘ah’ sound. Rather the ‘ah’ sound is simply inserted
into the exhale as it continues without interruption.

3. The motion is with the shoulders, not the arms or hands
4. The movement should not be rapid. If it is done rapidly,

the proper shrug, throw, or thrust is lost.
5. A single inhale should be sufficient for about five

motions during the exhale.
6. Even though the motions are vigorous, the soft ‘ah’

sound does not change



334 Reichian technique, Part Two

This exercise can produce some fairly strong emotional 
reactions. Since many people are inhibited in allowing the show 
of emotion in the presence of someone else, it can be better if the 
helper is not present during these exercises. That is an individual 
difference so adjust accordingly.

If the helper is present and it does not unduly inhibit the 
worker, there is the potential for a big effect by the helper. What 
happens here does require sensitivity (or some good guess work) 
by the helper. As the worker is mouthing a phrase, the helper can 
take the place of the parent-to-the-child. Some examples: the 
worker is saying “please” and the helper responds with “no” or 
“don’t beg” or “don’t bother me.” The worker is saying “why” 
and the helper responds with “because I said so” or “you know 
why” or “because your no damn good.” The worker is saying “I 
won’t” and the helper responds with “yes, you will” or “don’t 
talk back to me” or “so you want a beating, is that it.”

In short, the helper places himself or herself in the frame of 
mind of the parent to that young child and uses phrases that the 
worker might have heard hundreds of times while growing up.

PRESSURE

Some people have a lot of trouble with roll the shoulders 
(back or front). In that case, pressure on the wing muscles by the 
helper can be useful. There are two of these muscles but it is 
difficult to tell which muscle you are on so I will simply say to 
use pressure in general in the area (Figure 147).

Figure 147



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             335

THE CHEST AND DIAPHRAGM

Cough exhale
Sneeze
Gasp inhale belly
Gag
Croak hold and flick
Double croak hold and flick

No helper action needed. The helper can point out if the gasp 
is slow. The worker may not be able to sense that the gasp is a 
quick inhale rather than a gasp. The helper can also point out if 
the flick is really a flick (recall, of the diaphragm, not the belly) 
or is instead a short distension of the belly (but not a flick as 
such).

Obviously the helper can be of use to bring on sneezes (by 
tickling the nose with a feather or by a pinch of pepper). If the 
worker is leaning into the gag rather than sitting straight up, this 
can be pointed out. 

PRESSURE

Pressure on the diaphragm is easy and is, by comparison to 
other muscles, light. The diaphragm is a very thin muscle and 
thus prolonged light (for a whole session) pressure is sufficient to 
make it sore and thus to make it let go of some of the tension. The 
placement of the finger and direction of pressure is shown in 
Figure 148. Note that the fingers are just below the ribs (left) and 
are pointing upward (right).

Pressure on the diaphragm has another highly useful property, 
one that I use routinely. If I got a report from a patient that they 
are starting to deal with anger in such a way that it is causing 
them trouble at work or at home, then I spend one full session 
with pressure on the diaphragm. That almost always corrects the 
problem. I have already said why that works, but it can be said 
again. The diaphragm is associated with anxiety. Anger and 
anxiety play against each other. If anger is excessive, then 
increase the level of anxiety and it will damper the anger.



336 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 148

ABDOMEN

roll the pelvis

No helper action needed. The helper can, however, watch that 
the pelvis is being rolled by use of the front leg muscles (the 
quadriceps femoris) rather than by abdominal tension or by 
spreading the legs.

If the legs are being spread then simply placing an arm across 
the legs will prevent their use in this way (Figure 149).

Figure 149

PRESSURE



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             337
Pressure on the abdominal muscles is often helpful. There are 

two kinds of pressure used here. One is very light pressure. That 
is shown in Figure 150. Some surprisingly strong feelings can 
arise from this pressure.

Figure 150

The other pressure is hard. The abdominal muscles are big and 
strong and thus usually fairly strong pressure can be used. There 
are actually two areas of pressure. One is directly designed to 
work on the front abdominal muscles and the other the muscles at 
the side of the abdomen. Pressure on the muscles on the side of 
the abdomen is especially helpful if the worker is unable to get 
much movement in the chest with the inhale. The muscle at the 
side of the abdomen runs from the pelvis to the lower ribs and 
thus can act to keep the chest held down.

Figure 151



338 Reichian technique, Part Two

THE PELVIS

roll the pelvis 
toss the pelvis 
roll the pelvis (stomach)
slam the pelvis (stomach)
coin in the ass

No helper action needed. As with other exercise, the helper 
can mention if the roll the pelvis is being done by using the 
abdominal muscles or by spreading the legs; the toss the pelvis is 
being done by lifting the back off the bed and/or if the shout is 
weak; if the roll the pelvis (stomach) is being done by lifting the 
body off the bed (as opposed to just arching the back); if the slam 
the pelvis lacks vehemence or if the shout is weak.

LEGS

kick with the legs (swim kick)
legs open and close
kick with the legs
slam kick (fast)
slam kick (slow)

No helper action needed aside from the usual comments if an 
exercise is being done incorrectly. The swim kick can be too slow 
or the legs lifted too high. The slam kick (fast) can be either too 
fast or too slow and the height can be too little or too much. The 
slam kick (slow) can be too fast or with insufficient intensity of 
the shout. That leaves the legs open and close exercise where the 
helper can be quite active. 

legs open and close

Except for pressure discussed below, no helper action is 
needed.

PRESSURE



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             339

The first type of pressure is pressure to further open the legs 
when they are flopped open. Unfortunately, I don’t have a 
photograph of that so I will just describe it. Pressure is applied 
with the palms of the hands at the arrows and downward toward 
the bed (Figure 152). The pressure is steady but not too strong, 
just enough to stress those thigh adductors (that are tight and 
therefore do no allow the legs to open more). The pressure is held 
for about 60 seconds and then removed. It can be done several 
times during the course of a legs open and close session. 

Figure 152

Pressure on the legs by the helper can be very useful to the 
worker. There are several areas where pressure can be used. Here 
because of the size and density of the muscles the pressure must 
be done with either the knuckle, paired thumbs or a massage tool. 
The areas of pressure and the use of the knuckle and paired 
thumbs is shown in the following photographs. As usual, 
pressure should be applied to the tolerance level of the worker 
but the worker should attempt to accept the pressure without 
resorting to masochism or a “look what I can take” character trait 
or a “you can’t hurt me” character trait.

In other words, the worker should be willing to accept the pain 
(if present) but should also be ready and willing to say “enough” 
or “stop.” 

An especially useful way to apply this pressure is to start to 
the point where there is pain and then lighten up just a bit. Hold 



340 Reichian technique, Part Two

that and if you feel the tension in the muscle letting go then go in 
harder (follow the tension).

Notice in the last photograph in Figure 153 that pressure is 
being applied to the muscle on the outside (lateral) aspect of the 
calf. This muscle is called the tibialis anterior and it is 
surprisingly tight in many people.



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             341

There are two new exercises that can be done only if there is a 
helper. 

KICK THE PILLOW (NEW EXERCISE)

This exercises uses the same large pillow that was used in Part 
One of the book to bring the head to the chest. This exercise deals 
with various held attitudes in the legs. 

In the inhale (a normal belly then chest inhale) the legs are 
drawn upward as shown in Figure 154 (top left). On the exhale 
the legs are kicked out against the pillow with as much force and 
vehemence as the worker can manage. The exhale sound is a 
shout. The exact character of the exhale sound is not important as 
long as, for the worker, it indicates force and anger, the implied 
desire to injure the helper (Figure 154, top right and bottom left). 



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             343
Figure 154

Note in the upper right photograph in Figure 154 that the 
helper is holding the pillow. The pillow rests on the bed and 
against the helper’s abdomen. The worker should be positioned 
on the bed such that the kick not only strikes the pillow but also 
pushes the helper backwards about a foot.

There are two errors commonly made in this exercise. The 
first is inadequate force and lack of the intention to (figuratively) 
destroy the helper. 

The second error is that instead of the legs coming straight out 
(right next to the bed) the legs come up and out. I have shown 
this in Figure 155. Compare the placement of the feet on the 
pillow in Figure 155 to the lower left panel in Figure 154.

Figure 155

CHOKE THE WRIST (NEW EXERCISE)

This is another exercise that requires a helper. This exercise 
gets at the anger or frustration or hate or like character attributes 
related to the arms and hands. 

While the worker continues the breathing, the helper extends 
his (her) wrist for the worker to choke with both hands. The 
sound should change from an ‘ah’ to an angry growl. This growl 
sound need not be the growl sound discussed in Part One of the 
book on the breathing and presented on the Sounds of Reichian 
audio.

Figure 156

PRESSURE ON THE BACK MUSCLES

There are no good exercises for the muscles of the back 
running along the spine. The only choice here is to use knuckle 
pressure or to use one of the gouging devices (either the 
commercial one or the constructed ones I use).

Figure 157



Chapter 22, Working with a helper             345
While anatomically there are multiple sets of muscles that run 

along the spine, for this work we concentrate on only two sets.
The first set, shown in the upper right panel of Figure 157 and 

the lower left panel of Figure 157 run directly along and only 
slight off the spinal column. The held tension here is usually easy 
to fell and in its stronger form actually feels to the helper as 
though there were a round rope running along the spine. This 
tension can be strong in one area and all but absent just above or 
below. There is a strange phenomenon in the use of pressure in 
this work. I observed it myself in my therapy and many of the 
people I have worked with have commented on it. While the 
pressure hurts, at the same time it feels good. Perhaps it is like 
what many people have experienced with a deep massage where 
the needing of the muscle both hurts and feels good at the same 
time.

The second set is shown in the upper left panel of Figure 157. 
These are the two muscles that connect the wing bone (the 
scapula) to the spine (the two muscles are the superior and 
inferior rhomboids). It is surprising how many people have held 
tension in these muscles. Perhaps it reflects the character trait of 
stubborn independence; the unwillingness to reach out for help or 
nurturance (if these muscle are tight, they tend to prevent the 
rotation of the scapula which is necessary for the arms to reach 
forward).

THE APPLICATION OF THE WORK TO SEXUALITY

Think back to when you were in high school and just starting 
to experience sexuality. Do you recall how you used to pant 
while experiencing sexual arousal? Now think about your current 
sexual activity. Very likely now you breathe heavily only as a 
function of the exertion of intercourse. 

You were right in high school and wrong now. At your next 
sexual experience breathe deeply and rapidly. Your sexual 
experience wil l  be unlike anything you have recently 
experienced. 

Holding one’s breath is the major way people attempt to 
control their sexual response. Take your Reichian breathing into 
your sexual activity and see the difference it makes.



346 Reichian technique, Part Two

EXTRA: OVERCOMING ANXIETY OR PANIC

One of these methods comes from yoga and the other from 
medicine.

Yoga

Inhale fully through the nose on a count of seven seconds. 
Exhale fully through the nose on a count of seven seconds. That 
is during both the inhale and the exhale you count seven seconds 
in your head  (one, and, two, and …). Make sure the count is slow 
so that you are counting the seconds. Usually about half a dozen 
breaths is sufficient to stop the anxiety but there is no reason not 
to continue this slow methodical breathing until you are sure the 
anxiety is gone.

Medicine

Inhale slowly just to the belly. Since normal breathing is about 
12 breaths per minute, here you will make it about eight per 
minute. Both parts of this anti-anxiety procedure are needed for it 
to do its work: (1) the breathing is only to the belly and (2) the 
breathing is slow. Place your hands on your ribs to see that they 
are not moving. Just pay attention to your anxiety level as you do 
the slow belly breathing and continue until the anxiety is 
significantly reduced or is gone. The anxiety reduction of this 
technique is the subject of several medical text books.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          347

CHAPTER 23

COMPLETING THE PROCESS

Body-based psychotherapy (here, self-therapy) is a wonderful 
technique. It accomplishes things that no other form of 
psychotherapy can accomplish. Except for depth therapies like 
psychoanalysis or Jungian analysis, this is the only therapy that 
seeks basic change. But unlike psychoanalysis or Jungian 
analysis, it does not depend on massive amounts of time and 
money and it is not dependent upon your willingness to believe in 
things of which you can have no personal knowledge. 

Now it is true that, in general, body-based psychotherapy 
(here based on the technique that Reich developed) is a slow 
process. But, then, so are the other depth therapies. The very idea 
of “depth” carries with it the idea of slowness. 

Except for body-based psychotherapy and the two depth 
verbal therapies, other therapies are problem-oriented. That is not 
a criticism. Some people are introspective, they want to 
understand themselves and why they act as they do. But most 
people seek out a therapist because they are having a problem 
with living. Some part, or many parts, of their life is (are) not 
working as they wish. These people don’t necessarily want more 
than specific problem resolution and, if so, there are many fine 
verbal therapies available to them.

If you are in some form of verbal therapy, this work does not 
conflict with that verbal therapy. In fairness to your therapist, you 
should tell him or her that you are starting this work. But other 
than that, there is no conflict between this work and any form of 
verbal therapy.

That being said, here is the caveat. As fine a technique as 
Reichian therapy is, IT IS NOT COMPLETE IN ITSELF. 
Reichian therapy without verbal therapy — whether formally 
done with a therapist or with integrity undertaken by yourself — 



348 Reichian technique, Part Two

does not do the whole job. This is not to diminish Reichian 
technique, the same caveat is true of all the other body-based 
psychotherapy approaches.

In saying that it is not complete I am not belittling the work 
that I have done for over 35 years nor am I aiming criticism at 
any of the other schools of body-based psychotherapy. It is just 
that when you treat a person, you can’t just treat their 
disembodied mind or their disemminded body. Disemminded is 
my made-up word, but it fits. It is a whole person that lives, it is 
not just a body with tensions (or holding) and it is not just a 
repression-dominated37 mind. A complete job requires that all 
aspects be addressed.

In this book I have presented Reich’s approach to body-based 
psychotherapy to the extent that it can be done by oneself. A 
practicing Reichian therapist can, not surprisingly, go beyond 
what I have presented. But for all the good that Reichian therapy 
does, it is not sufficient. It is not complete. It needs the added 
step of either formal verbal therapy or of self-study along some 
of the lines I will present here. Just doing the work that I have 
presented in this book can take you a long way; but it will leave 
behind much that still needs work.

Up till now this book has been a work book, not a text book. 
In the words that a philosopher would use, this has been a 
knowing how rather than a knowing why. Now I have to get 
technical and thus you will now see the references that I have, till 
now, generally avoided.

Self-study is a big subject, far too big for a concluding 
chapter; so I will limit myself to presenting some of the major 

37. I have serious doubt that the concept of repression is valid. There 
is a whole literature which has appeared in the last 25 years that 
effectively takes Freud’s theory apart piece by piece and, as well, a 
body of literature which calls into serious question the validity of 
“recovered memories.” 
I would also mention that the theory of repression as put forth by 
Freud was that memories, ideas, drives, or drive derivatives, not 
emotions, were repressed (Laplanche & Pontalis, 1967/1973; 
Moore & Fine, 1990). The idea produced unpleasant emotion and 
to avoid the emotion the ideas and memories were repressed.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          349
issues and some methods you can use to supplement the body 
work with thinking work.

Throughout the preparation of this book a major issue which 
has confronted me again and again is the question of the order of 
presentation of material. That problem rears its maddening head 
even more in this chapter. I would prefer, following the general 
approach of this book, to just present techniques that you can use 
to do the cognitive work. But that is simply not possible; there 
are some theoretical issues that are requisite to the effective use 
of the techniques. So, with some apologies, I am going to present 
the technical material first. If you find the material uninteresting 
or annoying, you can skip to page 418 and read just the 
techniques section.

A reasonable question, before I even start this exposition, is 
why? Why go into all this? Obviously I could just close this book 
at this point, at documenting the therapy for home use. However, 
I am a therapist, not a documentary book writer. To leave this 
book without this chapter would be to leave my reader better off, 
but still with major uncorrected issues. That is not the stance of a 
healer, it is the stance of a pitchman. Thus, this chapter.

When I wrote this chapter, it all seemed logical to me and to 
flow properly from subject to subject. But that was before I came 
back to read it many months later. Then it seemed immensely 
dense. So much material in so little space. This chapter is already 
over 100 pages, so expanding on all the topics was out of the 
question. My solution, presented here, is to first provide an 
outline of the chapter with page number references. Then, at 
least, you can see where you are and where you are going.

Thus, I have maintained, the issue in psychotherapy is mistaken 
concepts not “emotional problems.” 

There are implications to this emphasis that, by connotation, 
get incorporated into the natural view of my reader. Before I 
continue I want to deal explicitly with these connotative 
assumptions.

The neurologist and cognitive neuroscientist, Antonio 
Damasio (1994)38, in a justly famous book, in my opinion and 
those of the many other authors who cite this work, showed 
conclusively that rational action is not possible without emotion. 
Damasio spoke of people with orbital prefrontal lesions and the 
type of deficit which they routinely display. Such people, 
presented with purely rational tasks like math problems or logic 
problems operate at normal (that is, just like people without 
orbital-prefrontal-lesions) levels and their solutions are no more 
nor less rigorous that anyone else. The difference arises, and 
strikingly so, when they are required to convert rational thinking 
into rational action. Damasio cites the relevant test of solving 
MBA-type business problems. The solutions brain-damaged and 
non brain-damaged people arrive at are equal in rigor and logic. 
But when the people with orbital prefrontal brain damage are 
then put to the test of translating this thinking into action, they 
are wildly irresponsible, impulsive, and illogical leading to easily 
foreseen failure. The difference, as Damasio I think well 
demonstrates and defends, is that they lack the emotional 
component of desire and caring about the outcome. Their 
thinking is unimpaired, their action is greatly impaired because 
their action does not depend on emotional state.39 Rational 
action, that is to say action that serves the end goal of successful 
living, requires emotion to operate. 

B.    BENEFICIAL

There are people who are born without the ability to 
experience physical pain. They do not know when they have 
injured themselves or when they have an illness (like an inflamed 

38.References are grouped after this chapter starting on page 463.
39.It is the prefrontal cortex that evaluates emotion.



354 Reichian technique, Part Two

appendix) because they can not experience the pain of the injury 
or the illness. They tend to die young and, in any event, need 
nearly constant monitoring such that a guardian serves as a 
surrogate pain evaluator. 

Emotions add spice to life that would make life without them 
directly akin to the person who can not experience pain. How 
long would a person persist if there were no awareness of fear? 
What becomes of the feeling of beauty, of the esthetic 
experience, of love, of hurt, of revenge, even to bring it home, of 
humor and laughter. 

Life without emotions would be, to steal the phrase, certainly 
“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” (Hobbes, 1660/1998; cf. 
Wollheim, 1999).

C.     ENEMY

There are two old experiments in psychology which bear 
reporting here. The first concerns what came to be called “the 
approach-approach” problem. If an animal is placed directly in 
the middle between two equally desirable food sources, the result 
is that the animal stands in the middle until it dies of starvation. 
To choose either desirable food source is to avoid the other 
equally desirable food source; the end result is the inability to 
make a decision and the paralysis of action unto death.

The other is called “the conditioned fear paradigm.” Here an 
animal is placed in a situation that is unpleasant (e.g. it is hungry 
but the food source is a short distance away). To escape the 
unpleasant situation the animal has to travel over a pathway that 
produces pain (usually an electrical shock to the paws). After a 
few repetitions of this experiment, the pain-production potential 
is disconnected (i.e. there can be no further painful paw shocks). 
The result is that the animal never learns that it can no longer be 
hurt. Having learned that the pathway to food produces pain, it 
never tries the now harmless pathway again. It, too, starves in the 
sight of food.

Emotions, like love or laughter, enrich life — they are the 
flavoring that makes life palatable — they also constrict, inhibit, 
indeed even prohibit that life such that they lead to death in 
anorexia or the suicide of hopelessness or pain. Emotion is 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          355
present in the human and, indeed, Damasio (1994) has presented 
cogent data and argument to say that we could not function in the 
world without them. But emotion is not just self-pity (weeping), 
anger, and fear. Emotion includes desire, a concern about the 
outcome of our actions, pride, and about 550 other issues. A 
theory of therapy which views itself as only dealing with 
emotions — and moreover with only a very few of them — is a 
priori labeling itself as marginal. It is not without reason that 
Reichian practitioners are almost non-existent.

Is it simplistic to say that our goal is to increase the joy and 
reduce the pain? Perhaps so; but then why would one ever 
undertake this path of self-study if that hope were not present and 
the goal reachable? Reich gave us the gift of a method, it is up to 
us to employ and amplify that method to reach the goal most 
sought.

criticism in the last 25 years, still these metaphorical terms are 
conceptually useful.

Next I will return to a discussion of character. I have 
previously defined the concept of character (in Chapter one), but 
here I will explore the concept in greater depth. My objective is 
to communicate the extent to which character permeates 
everything about you.

Next there will be the first of a two-part discussion of 
defenses. Part one will be here in the theoretical section and part 
two will be in the techniques section.

Body-based psychotherapy, to be charitable, has been 
extremely derelict in attempting to base the whole of its rationale 
on the single defense mechanism of repression. If, as seems more 
likely all the time, the scholarship on the concept of repression 
shows the concept of repression to be mistaken40, then the whole 
rationale, as previously put forth, for body-based psychotherapy 
will be undone along with the concept of repression. It is indeed 
unfortunate that so fine a technique as body-based psychotherapy 
should be made to rest on so slim a foundation as the theory of 
repression.

I will then turn to the most important of the 41 defenses other 
than repression. By most important I mean the ones that are most 
significant both from the point of view of character and from the 
point of view of being commonly in use. These are the ones that I 
will, in turn in the techniques section, focus on in presenting 
techniques. At the end of the chapter, for reference, I will present 
two tables that list all the defense mechanisms and their 
approximate age of appearance.

   A.    THE SUPEREGO AND THE EGO IDEAL

40.See: Crews, 1998, 2006; Ellenberger, 1970; Erwin, 1996; 
Esterson, 1993; Grünbaum, 1984; Macmillan, 1997; Webster, 
1995.

“First, I want to point out that, despite over sixty years of research 
involving numerous approaches by many thoughtful and clever 
investigators, at the present time there is no controlled laboratory 
evidence supporting the concept of repression. It is interesting to 
note that even most of the proponents of repression agree with that 
conclusion.” (Holmes, 1998, p. 161; cf. Singer, 1990).



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          357

1.    Description Of The Superego And The Ego Ideal

While both the superego and the ego ideal, as we will see, are 
major problems in the human being, our first task is to distinguish 
between the two and to locate both relative to the ego. 

The superego is our internal policeman. It decides right or 
wrong, do it or don’t do it, permitted or not permitted. It is the 
superego that produces feelings of shame and guilt. It is the 
superego that inhibits and prevents; it makes us obey the rules, 
both legal and social. The superego stops us.

While the superego inhibits, the ego ideal compels. While the 
superego says what we can’t do, the ego ideal says what we must 
do. It does not say we must do in the sense of obey (for that is the 
job of the superego), but what we must do in the sense of achieve 
or obtain to. While the superego gives us shame and guilt (if we 
disobey its rules), the ego ideal gives us “a sense of failure,”  and/
or defeat, and/or futility (if we don’t live up to its demands).

2.    The  Structural Theory And The Superego

When Freud came, late in his writings, to posit the id, the ego, 
and the superego his theory was termed “the structural theory.” 
This was as opposed to his earlier topographic and economic 
theories (Yankelovich & Barrett, 1971). Each of his three 
metaphorical entities — id, ego, and superego — was a structure 
that developed in a specific manner, for specific reasons, to fulfill 
specific functions. Our interest here lies with the ego and its place 
in the scheme of things.

We need to understand the ego in this theoretical formulation 
because it is the ego which will, in the end, be our friend and 
savior.

As Freud postulated the system, the ego was that part of the 
psychic structure that (1) dealt with reality and (2) served as 
mediator between the id and the superego. The id said “I want it”, 
the superego said “you can’t have it”, and the ego looked to 
reality and to those two demands and tried to find a way out of 
the dilemma, a compromise formation (you will find compromise 
formation listed among the defenses at the end of this chapter). It 



358 Reichian technique, Part Two

also fell to the ego to find ways, if possible, to satisfy the 
demands of the ego ideal. The structural place of the ego ideal 
relative to the superego was as a part of it, with a demand 
function instead of a prohibition function.41

As Freud formulated the system, the ego was not only a 
mediator between competing demands, it was also continually in 
a state of conflict between those demands. It fell to Hartman 
(1939/1958) to point out that not all ego functions were 
conflicted. There was also a “conflict-free” sphere of the ego. 
That conflict-free sphere of the ego is our ally in this attempt to 
counteract the war of the structures that wages within each of us.

Returning to the superego, the theorist Roy Schafer (1976, pp. 
283-4) writes of the superego as:

In its individual rather than social aspect, one thinks that 
it is oneself who is doing the scolding or punishing, 
perhaps unconsciously. Metapsychologically, we call 
this individual aspect by the name Freud gave it, the 
superego, and we say it is an intrapsychic agency. But 
by resorting to this language, we no longer say (what is 
perfectly adequate to the occasion) that sometimes one 
judges one's own actions in an irrational, infantile, 
severely moralistic, or punitive manner, and especially 
that one does so even unbeknown to oneself, that is, 
unconsciously;  we say ins tead that  i t  i s  one 's  
superego that (or who) judges one's ego (or one's 
self) in these ways. Thereby we set up superego as a 
personified entity of another sort: a so-called psychic 
structure that sets standards, prohibits, judges, and 
punishes cruelly just as the parents of one's childhood 
once did or, with the help of exaggeration, seemed to 
do or seemed ready to do. The obsessional neurotic is 
our best example in this connection.42

41.The ego ideal has grown in importance with the writing of Heniz 
Kohut on narcissism wherein it is termed, variously, the idealized 
parent imago or the idealized self-object.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          359
Similarly, Moore & Fine (1990, p. 189) speak of the superego 

thusly:

One of three hypothetical systems of the tripartite (structural) 
model, the superego sets up and maintains an intricate system 
of ideals and values, prohibitions and commands (the 
conscience); it observes and evaluates the self, compares it 
with the ideal, and either criticizes, reproaches, and punishes, 
leading to a variety of painful affects, or praises and 
rewards, thereby raising self esteem. Freud introduced the 
term Über-Ich (superego) in 1923, used it synonymously 
with his earlier term Ich-Ideal (ego ideal), and described it 
as a step (Stufe) or differentiation within the ego. He 
viewed it as largely unconscious, reflecting the clinical 
observation that in many patients self-criticism and conscience 
were as much outside of awareness as the drives: "not only 
what is lowest but also what is highest in the ego can be 
unconscious.

I think we have covered this enough, at least from the classical 
Freudian point of view. But there are two other theorists I want to 
introduce into this witch’s brew. First Edmund Bergler (1949, 
1960, 1961) and then Karen Horney (1950). 

B.   PSYCHIC MASOCHISM, THE CONTRIBUTION 
OF EDMUND BERGLER

Edmund Bergler is a much under-appreciated theorist. Yes, he 
had his nutty side; but then what theorist does not have a nutty 
side? I’ll skip the nutty and get right to the pecan pie.

42.In the original German, Freud used the terms das Ich (the I) and 
das Selbst (the self) seemingly interchangeably. When Strachey in 
‘The Standard Edition’ translated Freud into English, the single 
term Ego was used for both das Ich and das Selbst. I have 
deliberately in this book avoided the issue of the Self as it is still a 
term lacking of any generally accepted definition (Kirchner & 
David, 2003; Kohut, 1977).



360 Reichian technique, Part Two

There are two concepts of Bergler’s that I think add greatly to 
this discussion of the superego and the ego ideal. The two 
concepts are: (1) psychic masochism and (2) injustice collecting.

I’ll start by letting Bergler speak for himself (1961, p. 31-2):

    Now being the object of "self-aggression" is 
painful and humiliating, to say the least.  Every 
human being lives on the basis of the "pleasure 
principle." What pleasure, if any, can be derived 
from hitting oneself? Obviously none, unless one 
makes  a  p leasure  ou t  of  d ispleasure .  That  i s  
exactly what the future "psychic masochist" does. 
The only pleasure one can derive from displeasure is to 
make  p l easure  ou t  o f  d i sp l easure  ( " p sych i c  
masochism").
   . . . 
    N o b o d y  c a n  g o  t h r o u g h  t h e  p r o t r a c t e d  
helplessness of childhood without acquiring some 
traces of this psychic poison. Psychic masochism 
is a universal human trait;  to deny it  is just as 
naive as to deny that every human being possesses an 
organ called a heart.
    The genius of the infant,  baby, small  child 
solved one of the most complex problems of the 
psychic economy. It created the "genetic picture" 
in psychic masochism, dealt with in part by Freud. 
Unfortunately the process does not stop at that point.
    The next development simply confirms the 
already established trouble. The aggression of the 
child is not directed against indifferent people; its 
ta rgets  are  parents  and the i r  representa t ives ,  
"people with a halo." Why exactly parents? They 
are "just around." . . . They invoke the "triad of 
retribution": punishment, moral reproach, guilt.
    T h e  p r o b l e m  o f  g u i l t  i s  o f  d e c i s i v e  
c o n s e q u e n c e .  I t  a c q u i r e s  a  d o u b l e  
representat ion:  mother  ( father)  and the  inner  
conscience (superego).



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          361
    The origin of guilt dates from the earliest phase 
of development when the inexpressible fury of 
frustrat ion rebounds against  the ego. The first 
results of this ricochet, a feeling of helplessness 
and unease and subsequent depression, are the pre-
stages of guilt.
    It is against the background of the inescapable 
accumulation of this rebounding aggression that 
we must view the child's pathetic attempts to cope 
with external troubles. His first inner expedient for 
dealing with the outer world was described by 
Freud as the "ego ideal."43

One could only wish that Freud were as concise. In a few short 
paragraphs Bergler has posited the ‘reason why’ both the 
superego and the ego ideal are formed and, in the process, has 
added to our understanding by adding the concept of psychic 
masochism.44

But Bergler has another important point to make about the ego 
ideal. It is a point we will address again in this chapter. Bergler 
writes (ibid p. 33)

    The ego ideal, therefore, is composed of the child's 
original and indestructible megalomania ( later  
attenuated to narcissism and self-love) amalgamated 
with internal ized parental  prohibi t ions.  In  i ts  
introjected45 sectors, however, the ego ideal is not an 
exact copy of the parents. The precise formulation is 
"parents as the child perceived - them." Since a good 
deal of the child's aggression was projected on the 
parents their images have already been colored and 
altered by a patina of this projected aggression.

43.In the list of coping (defense) mechanisms at the end of this 
chapter, this mechanism is “turning against the self.”

44.An earlier variant of this concept was called “moral masochism” 
(cf. Fenichel, 1945; Freud S,. 1924/1959).

45.Introjection as a coping  (defense) mechanism is in our list at the 
end of this chapter.



362 Reichian technique, Part Two

    The narcissistic sector, the larger ingredient of the 
mixture, has the purpose of protecting the ego from 
humiliation and maintaining the needed assurance of 
all-power. It contains the child's braggadocio, his 
boasting of what he can do, his grandiose promises 
for the future, his "dreams of glory," amusing to 
an adult sense of reality but utterly serious to the 
ch i ld .  These  h igh-p i t c hed  a ims ,  c rea ted  and  
advertised in childhood, later become one of the most 
fertile sources of self-torture.

Now before we turn to Bergler’s  second important  
contribution (I do not mean thereby that Bergler’s only 
contributions to theory are the two presented here) I want to 
highlight some issues in the two quotes.

First, note that the development as Bergler lays it out is based 
on the parental inhibition of the child’s aggression. Since many 
people reading this book will have previously steeped themselves 
in Reich’s contention that the issue is childhood sexuality, the 
difference needs to be emphasized that it is the natural aggressive 
drive of the child that is prohibited, not his sexuality.46

The second, and more salient, issue is Bergler’s emphasis on 
the child’s megalomania and its time-transformation into 
narcissism. Narcissism is a crucial issue in all of therapy 
(Morrison, 1986) and is a psychological component not dealt 
with at all, in any direct sense, by body-based psychotherapy. 
Narcissism is largely ignored by Reich47 and was totally ignored, 
to his shame, by Lowen. 

46.In this, Lowen (1958) comes closer to the mark. Where Reich put 
all the onus on sexuality, Lowen has placed all the onus on 
aggression. 

47.Reich’s postulation of a phallic narcissistic character is nearly the 
whole of his interest in the subject. Phallic narcissism is one of 
five recognized narcissistic characters: (1) primary narcissism, (2) 
secondary narcissism, (3) pathological narcissism (Kernberg, 
1975), (4) phallic narcissism, and (5) Kohutian narcissism.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          363
Lowen, when the psychological world passed him by as it started 
increasingly to focus on narcissism, tried to play catch-up by 
publishing a book entitled Narcissism (1983).48

Finally I should like to emphasize that the over-riding 
emotion, as it is recognized by the person and therefore is a 
feeling, is guilt. It is not that aggression is repressed, it is simply 
that the aggression is turned against the self giving rise to an 
intra-punitive superego and ego ideal. The claim put forth both 
by Reich and Lowen that aggression is “repressed” is not 
supported.

At this point I want to draw a distinction that Bergler did not 
draw but which, in my opinion, is closer to the observed facts. 
Guilt, as such, is a fairly mature emotion. Its predecessor is 
shame. Guilt, as formal feeling, does not arise until somewhere 
about the age of seven; prior to that time it is shame (Morrison, 
1989).49 The distinction is observed by parents when they 
confront young children with “aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” 
or “you should be ashamed of yourself.” It sounds foreign to the 
ear to confront a young child with “don’t you feel guilty?” A 
child who has urinated in his bed or failed to get to the toilet in 
time experiences shame at his act, he does not feel guilty about it.

48.The book is, frankly, an embarrassment to the whole field of body-
based psychotherapy. By the time Lowen wrote it he had already 
published eight other books. Since he had exhaustively analyzed 
character in terms of the body in his first book, to suddenly find 
‘oh, by the way, there is also narcissism in the body’ can only 
work to discredit the whole field.

49.(p. 2) “As guilt invites confession and forgiveness (ref.), shame 
generates concealment out of a fear rendering the self 
unacceptable (ref.).” However for a different view, and one tying 
both shame and guile to a genetic variable called field-
independence and field-dependence, see Lewis, 1990.



364 Reichian technique, Part Two

In explaining injustice collecting, a component of psychic 
masochism, again I will let Bergler (1960, pp 47-8)50 present the 
case:

Nobody, as I have said, is entirely uninfluenced by 
the unconscious pleasure-in-displeasure pattern. But 
there are some people who unconsciously feel at 
home in one, and exclusively in that one situation: 
behind the eight-ball. These are the confirmed psychic 
masochists. Their daily mental diet is incomplete unless 
it has included an offense against them, a humiliation, 
an affront they have sustained. Invariably, they have 
been "innocent victims" in these encounters with 
unaccountably "malicious" people. These psychic 
masochists expend a great deal of productive energy in 
achieving that externally unproductive aim. So attuned 
to rejection and humiliation are these "injustice 
collectors" that they either provoke a rebuff or misuse a 
situation to attain their purpose. A merciful fate 
p e r m i t s  t h e m  t o  "overlook" their  own init ial  
provocation or misuse of circumstances. As they see it, 
the "situation" begins when their imaginary opponent 
"unwarrantedly" attacks them With good conscience, 
righteous indignation and "justified" fury, they fight 
back ostensibly in  the cause of  sel f -d e f e n s e .  
Inevitably, they meet defeat, after which the revel 
in self-pity. Defeat is inevitable in every argument every 
battle, for the psychic masochist unconsciously and 
unknowingly has been careful enough to choose an 
opponent stronger than himself, or cunning enough to 
maneuver himself into an untenable situation.
    To people who found the generalization on self-
damaging tendencies difficult to accept, this outline of 

50.Bergler is well worth reading. I recommend The Basic Neurosis 
which you can find in the reference list. If the material from Freud 
which Bergler employs liberally is beyond your knowledge, there 
is an excellent introductory book to Freud: Hall, C. (1955). A 
primer of Freudian psychology,. New York: Signet. Unfortunately 
this book is now out of print but can be easily acquired on the used 
book market.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          365
psychic masochism in action undoubtedly appears more 
than incredible. It takes time, perhaps, to adjust to the 
presentation of so "unrealistic" a state of affairs, but 
perhaps a reminder will help: Only consciously is 
every  person,  h is  own friend and well-wisher. 
Unconsciously, the story reads differently. If a person 
unconsciously runs after the proverbial kick in the jaw, 
he is sure to get it—and more often than he bargained to.

Why did I include this theorist and these two ideas here? 
Simply because I find it presented so frequently in my therapy 
practice that I can well accept Bergler’s claim that it is endemic. 
It deserves to be presented and emphasized if I am to present a 
model for you to use in your cognitive work along side the body 
work.

C.   THE TYRANNY OF THE SHOULD, THE 
CONTRIBUTION OF KAREN HORNEY

Karen Horney was analyzed by Alfred Adler and there is a 
close similarity between her theory and that of Adler51. Horney 
was one of  the “neo-Freudians” along with, notably, H. S. 
Sullivan, Clara Thompson, and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann. The 
neo-Freudians based their approach not on a drive model as 
Freud did, but on an interpersonal model. 

There is much to recommend Horney, and her writing is 
deserving of much more space than it is accorded here. The issue 
addressed here, the tyranny of the should, is drawn from one 
book (1950)52 where the issue forms a chapter title.

If legally I could I would include here the full 22 pages of this 
chapter. Instead I have clipped and cut, even omitting the 
ellipses. Please understand that what follows is my butchering, 
for space reasons, of what Horney actually wrote. For those of 

51.Horney, in turn, analyzed Albert Ellis. Ellis is recognized along 
with A. Beck as founders of the now most prevalent form of 
evidence based therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy.

my readers whose curiosity is piqued, the book is readily 
available in trade paperback and is well worth purchasing.

Neurotic claims are concerned with the world outside as 
the person asserts the rights to which his uniqueness 
entitles him. His feelings allow him to live in a world of 
fiction. And whenever he falls short of being his idealized 
self, his claims enable him to make factors outside himself 
responsible. The inner dictates comprise all that the 
neurotic should be able to do, to be, to feel, to know and 
taboos on how and what he should not be. He should be 
the utmost of honesty, generosity, courage, endure 
everything, like everybody, love his parents, his wife, or, 
he should not be attached to anything or anybody, 
nothing should matter to him, he should never feel hurt. 
He should be spontaneous; he should always control his 
feelings. He should know, understand, and foresee 
everything. He should be able to solve every problem of 
his own, or of others. He should be able to overcome 
every difficulty. 

But to speak of too high demands on self does not 
reveal the peculiar characteristics of inner dictates. 
What strikes us is the same disregard for feasibility which 
pervades the entire drive for actualization. Other 
demands on self may not be fantastic in themselves yet 
show a complete disregard for the conditions under 
which they could be fulfilled. The inner dictates operate 
with a supreme disregard for the person's own psychic 
condition. The more a person lives in imagination, the more 
likely it is that he will simply spirit away difficulty. Thus 
the inner dictates do not aim at real change. They aim at 
making the imperfection disappear, or at making it 
appear as if the particular perfection were attained. This 
becomes especially clear if the inner demands are 
externalized. Then what a person actually is, and even 
what he suffers, becomes irrelevant. Only what is visible 
to others creates intense worries. The shoulds lack the 
moral seriousness of genuine ideals. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          367
There is one further quality of the shoulds that 

distinguishes them from genuine standards. That is their 
coercive character. Ideals have an obligating power 
over our lives. This means violent emotional reactions to 
nonfulfillment, reactions which traverse the whole 
range of anxiety, despair, self-condemnation, and self-
destructive impulses. Reactions of anxiety often escape 
attention because the customary defenses against anxiety 
are set going instantaneously. 

But there are great individual differences in the 
att i tudes toward this  tyranny and the ways of  
experiencing it. They range between the opposite poles 
of compliance and rebellion. The expansive type tends to 
identify himself with his inner dictates and to be proud of 
his standards. His arrogance may be so great that he does 
not even consider the possibility of failure, and discards 
it if it occurs. The self-effacing type, for whom love seems 
to solve all problems, likewise feels that his shoulds 
constitute a law not to be questioned. But when trying to 
measure up to them, he feels most of the time that he 
falls pitiably short of fulfilling them. The resigned type 
to whom the idea of "freedom" appeals more than 
anything else, is, of the three, most prone to rebel against 
his inner tyranny. Because of the very importance which 
freedom has for him, he is hypersensitive to any 
coercion. 

Sometimes a person who usually complies with the 
shoulds may go through a phase of rebellion. It is usually 
then directed against external restrictions. Finally, others 
may go through alternating phases of self-castigating 
"goodness" and a wild protest against any standards. 
Whatever the prevailing attitude, a great deal of the 
process is always externalized. Roughly, a person may 
primarily impose his standards upon others and make 
relentless demands as to their perfection. The more he 
feels himself to be the measure of all things, the more he 
insists upon his particular norms being measured up to. 
The failure of others to do so arouses his contempt or 
anger.  Again he may pr imari ly experience his  



368 Reichian technique, Part Two

expectations of himself as coming from others. And, 
whether these others actually do expect something or 
whether he merely thinks they do, their expectations then 
turn into demands to be fulfilled. He may try to anticipate 
or guess at their expectations in which case he usually also 
anticipates that they would condemn him or drop him at 
a moment's notice if he fails. Or, if he is hypersensitive 
to coercion, he feels that they are imposing upon him, 
meddling in his affairs, pushing him or coercing him. Or, 
if his rebellion is more aggressive, he will flaunt his 
defiance and believe that he does not in the least care what 
they think of him. The most general disturbance on this 
score is hypersensitivity to criticism. Otherwise the kinds 
of disturbance in human relations depend upon the kind 
of prevailing externalization. They may render him too 
critical and harsh of others or too apprehensive, too 
defiant, or too compliant. Most important of all, the 
shoulds further impair the spontaneity of feelings, wishes, 
thoughts, and beliefs, that is the ability to feel his own 
feelings, etc., and to express them. 

We are accustomed to think that we cannot control 
feelings but only behavior. But if the shoulds issue an 
order as to feelings, imagination waves its magic wand and 
the border line between what we should feel and what 
we do feel evaporates. We consciously believe or feel 
then as we should believe or feel. The creation of make-
believe feelings is most striking in those whose 
idealized image lies in the direction of goodness. Love 
readily makes way for indifference, or for resentment 
and contempt, when pride or vanity is hurt. An irruptive 
anger often is the only feeling that is really fair. At the 
other extreme, feelings of callousness and ruthlessness can 
also be exaggerated. The taboos on feelings of tenderness, 
sympathy, and confidence can be just as great in some 
neurotics as the taboos on hostility and vindictiveness are in 
others. Their emotional life then is less distorted than 
plainly impoverished. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          369
What Horney has done here is address the issue of the ego 

i dea l ,  bu t  i n  a  f o rm  much  expanded  f rom F reud ’ s  
conceptualization.

Freud saw the ego ideal as only the internalization53
(culminating during the oedipal situation) of the parent (or, to use 
his wonderful terms, the internalization of “the beloved enemy”). 
Horney has expanded that to consider the full range of ideals 
derived from the family culture and the general wider culture. In 
fact, recent research, summarized in Pinker (2002), indicates that 
the peer group has more influence on the final outcome of the 
person than do the parents.

What I would like you to take away from this discussion of 
Freud’s formulation and both Bergler’s and Horney’s 
amplification is the pervasive (and corrosive) nature of the 
superego and the ego ideal. There is no single more important 
issue in all of therapy than is the issue of, as I call it, defusing the 
superego. More than any putative repression or armoring or lack 
of grounding or other such neologism, it is the destruction 
wrought by the imperious demands of the superego and the ego 
ideal that constitute the major impediment to an enjoyable and 
self-directed life.

D.     CHARACTER

1.     Introduction

I have cast this whole book in terms of the issue of character. 
In doing so I have done with Reich what he did with Freud. Reich 
thought the early Freud was correct and Freud’s later repudiation 
and emendation of his prior theories was a mistake. I think 
Reich’s original formulation of his body work technique in terms 
of character (“character armor”) was correct and his later revision 
in terms or either orgone or emotion (either or both, take your 
pick) was incorrect.

53.Internalization is the general process of which there are three 
components listed in the coping mechanism table: introjection, 
incorporation, identification.



370 Reichian technique, Part Two

While I defined character in Chapter one and provided the 
story of Betty (page 6), the subject, as the major focus of this 
book and the reason d’être for the body work, deserves 
elaboration. This is especially true in this chapter where I will be 
supplying you with techniques to explore the derivative effects of 
character and, if consciously applied, cleanse yourself of these 
derivative.

2.     On The Definition Of Character

I would start with quoting what I wrote in Chapter one: 
“Character is the basic statement a person makes (unrecognized) 
about himself, the world and the relationship between the two.”54

But before I get into a discussion of character, it is important 
that I differentiate between several concepts: (1) character 
disorder versus neurosis55, (2) ego-syntonic versus ego-dystonic, 
and (3) Freud’s concept of character as opposed to the concept 
used here.

a.     Character disorder versus neurosis

Originally, in the literature of Freud’s time, there was a 
distinction drawn between character neurosis and symptom 
neurosis. Character, as we will discuss below in looking at 
Freud’s view of character, was considered to be a result of the 
operation of certain defenses. When those defenses failed to deal 
appropriately with the intrapsychic conflict (for which purpose 
they were employed) then symptoms emerged in the form of a 

54.The term used by Reich, character neurosis, is outdated and is no 
longer used. It was an acceptable terminology in 1933 when Reich 
wrote Character Analysis, but the compound term of character 
with neurosis is no longer used.

55.Current fashionable terminology is to replace the term ‘character 
disorder’ with the term ‘personality disorder’ and to drop the term 
neurosis while retaining the distinction between a character 
disorder and a neurosis. Thus, for example, the contemporary 
diagnostic manual (DSM-IV-TR) lists “obsessive-compulsive 
disorder” separately from ‘obsessive-compulsive personality 
disorder.’



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          371
neurosis. Thus the character was viewed as asymptomatic and the 
neurosis was viewed as symptomatic.

That distinction is still valid and, as noted in footnote 55, is 
still employed in current diagnostic manuals (though not with 
those names). That a character disorder is differentiated from a 
neurosis by the absence or presence of symptoms does not mean 
that both can not be present in the same individual. To the 
contrary, the presence of a (symptom) neurosis almost requires 
that the like character disorder lies beneath it. Thus being 
presented with an obsessive-compulsive neurosis, one makes the 
working assumption that there is also an obsessive-compulsive 
character disorder. 

However, to treat (or work on) a neurosis is not to treat the 
character disorder. The treatment of the two is different as is the 
objective of the treatment. One expects, and usually finds, that 
when one has corrected a character disorder that the related 
neurosis lessens or disappears; but that expectation is not 
guaranteed. 

The reason it is not guaranteed is due to another concept: the 
concept of  “functionally autonomous.” It would take us astray to 
discuss that here, so just keep it in mind for our later discussion.

Just to ground this distinction in history, here is what Freud 
wrote about the distinction between character and neurosis:

“In the field of development of character we are bound to 
meet with the same instinctual forces which we have found at 
work in the neuroses. But a sharp theoretical distinction 
between the two is necessitated by the single fact that the fail-
ure of repression and the return of the repressed—which are 
peculiar to the mechanism of neuroses—are absent in the forma-
tion of character. In the latter, repression either does not come 
into action or smoothly achieves its aim of replacing the repressed 
by reaction formations and sublimations. Hence, the processes 
of the formation of character are more obscure and less accessi-
ble to analysis than neurotic ones. (Freud 1913/1958,  p. 323)”

b.     Ego-syntonic versus ego-dystonic



372 Reichian technique, Part Two

Character is who you are as a person, it is your natural way of 
operating in the world. As such, you, in general, do not recognize 
that you are the way you are. It is simply you. You are probably 
aware of traits like friendly or shy, like neat or messy, like 
adventurous or cautious; you might even not like some of those 
traits and wish you were different; but most of what you are as a 
person are so ‘just you’ that you are not even aware of them. 

As an example, I am messy. I know it, but I also am 
comfortable with it. I keep a messy desk, I keep a messy home. 
But it is just more work, more time, to be neat then it is worth to 
me. So I accept that I am messy. My messiness is ego-syntonic. 
But, then, so are all my other traits, the ones I am not even aware 
of. They are all ego-syntonic, they do not disturb my ego’s 
equilibrium.

Ego-dystonic, by contrast, are traits that a person wishes he 
did not have. Traits that he is, as it were, forced to do but that he 
knows get in the way of his life. He wants to correct them, get rid 
of them, but he can’t. They are ego-dystonic. 

So ego-syntonic are character traits, whether known or 
(mostly) unknown, with which you are comfortable, that are just 
you. Ego-dystonic are traits or behaviors or conditions with 
which you are uncomfortable but can’t stop. Put another way, 
ego-syntonic is character, ego-dystonic is neurosis.

c.     Character in Freud’s thinking versus the 
concept used in this book

Lets start with two quotes. First from Moore and Fine (1990) 
published by the America Psychoanalytic Association (the 
underlining is mine to draw attention to the salient issue).

[Character is] The enduring, patterned functioning of an 
individual. As perceived by others, it is the person's habitual 
way of thinking, feeling, and acting. Understood 
psychodynamically, character is the person's habitual mode 
of reconciling intrapsychic conflicts. Character stands 
beside, but may be differentiated from, other terms for global 
aspects of personality, such as identity, self, and ego.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          373
A person's character is made up of an integrated 

constellation of character traits, each a complex admixture
of drive derivatives, defenses, and superego components. 
Character traits, like neurotic symptoms, are compromise 
formations. But character traits are more stable than 
symptoms, are better able to bind anxiety, and are experienced 
more as part of one's self (ego-syntonic). Character 
traits can be thought of as behavioral patterns that develop 
over time as the result of an attempt at resolution of 
intrapsychic conflict.  Character is most closely related to 
the concept of an individual's defensive style.

And now a quote from a recognized reference by Laplanche & 
Pontalis (1967/1973, pp. 67-8)

The mechanisms most usually invoked to account for 
the formation of character are sublimation and reaction-
formations. The latter ‘avoid secondary repressions by 
making a "once-and-for-all", definitive change of the 
personality'. In so far as it is the reaction-formations 
which predominate, the character itself may appear as 
an essentially defensive formation intended to protect 
the individual against the emergence of symptoms as 
well as against the instinctual threat.

From the descriptive standpoint, character defense is 
to be distinguished from the symptom particularly by 
its relative integration into the ego: there is a failure 
to recognize the pathological aspect of the character-
trait; rationalization and a defence originally directed 
against a specific threat is generalized into a pattern of 
behavior. It is possible to see such mechanisms as so 
many characteristics of the obsessional structure, in 
which case character neurosis would mean, first and 
foremost, a particularly common form of obsessional 
neurosis typified by a predominance of the mechanism 
of reaction-formation and by the discrete or sporadic 
nature of its symptoms.



374 Reichian technique, Part Two

There are two things to notice from the above two discussions 
of character. First, in traditional Freudian theory the formation of 
character involves (in fact is the result of) the application of 
defense mechanisms (compromise formation, sublimation, and 
reaction formation). All of these defense mechanisms are in the 
table of defenses at the end of the chapter. However, in passing, I 
would also point out that in neither discussion is repression 
mentioned as formative.

Second, the impetus to develop the character is the presence of 
“drive derivative” and “instinctual threats.” Since Freud’s theory 
is a drive theory, it follows coherently from there that the 
character would evolve as a means for dealing with the drives 
and the threats that arise from these drives (the oedipal conflict is 
one such instinctual threat).

The theory of character used in this book and upon which I 
shall shortly elaborate (see below: ON THE FORMATION OF 
CHARACTER) is one derived from the concept of coping and 
from a recognition of the primitive nature of the child’s brain. In 
short,  character develops out of the child’s attempt to 
conceptualize the data of his little environment. In that attempt he 
makes a host of errors, unknown to himself or to his parents, 
which errors in turn become the foundation of his character.

I wrote, page 370, that “Character is the basic statement a 
person makes (unrecognized) about himself, the world and the 
relationship between the two.” There are four issues raised by 
that statement of character: (1) unrecognized basic statement, (2) 
about himself, (3) about the world, and (4) about the relationship 
between the two. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          375
3.     Unrecognized Basic Statement

The first approximately two months of life are a stage that the 
researcher and theorist,  Margaret Mahler (1962/1979) calls the 
autistic period. During this period the infant is not yet aware that 
it is separate from the mother.56 No ‘I’ has yet developed, the 
world is simply an ‘it.’

During the next four months the child is in what Mahler 
(1967/1975) termed the symbiotic phase. The infant deals with 
itself and the mother as a symbiotic pair, neither can exist without 
the other. They are in omnipotent union.

It is only at the age of six months that the child begins to 
recognize that it is separate from the mother. That there is an I 
and an It. This phase, starting at six months and lasting until 36 
months, Mahler, Pine, and Bergman (1975) termed separation-
individuation with four sub-phases.

There is a reason why I am bringing in this issue. For the 
present just keep in mind that the child will pass through four 
phases of development (ending at three years of age) and that 
these four phases, taken as a whole, are termed separation-
individuation. Placing the beginning of a sense of “I” at six 
months of age as Mahler and colleagues do may be a bit 
optimistic.  The baby’s brain waves do not display the 
characteristic adult pattern until the age of nine months.57 

56.The neo-Freudian, Harry Stack Sullivan (1953; see also: Mullahy, 
1952) also draws particular attention to this period as does 
Melanie Klein (1961/1975, 1932/1975; see also: Grosskurth , 
1986).

57.Personal communication from Dr. Edward Gibbs, the father of 
modern electroencephalography. 



376 Reichian technique, Part Two

That fact gains significance in that prior to that degree of neural 
organization of the brain (that is, prior to the age of nine months) 
it is not possible to have long- term storage of memory.58

But the lack of memory, as such, does not mean that the infant 
can’t be affected by its surroundings. The baby’s brain is 
maturing and some circuits (called: neural pathways) are being 
strengthened by the development of new synaptic connections 
(called: facilitation) while other connections are decaying 
because of the death of brain cells and synapses. 

Thus, for example, the amygdala, which is the main brain 
organ mediating fear (LeDoux, 2002), is growing, maturing, and 
developing. If the infant is exposed to many fearful events those 
circuits in the amygdala will be potentiated. The child, by the 
process of maturation (a combination of nature and nurture 
[Ridley, 2003]) can develop a life-long sensitivity to fear and/or 
anxiety. This hypothetical child can subsequently display high 
startle reactions, shyness, caution in its play, unwillingness to 
undertake new activities, high ambient anxiety levels; and 
subsequently health problems as a result of a constantly high 
level of cortisol.

But none of that is character, it is temperament. Just as we 
have to distinguish between emotion and mood, so we must 
distinguish between character and temperament. Temperament is 
either a genetic predisposition or a pre-conceptual modeling of 
the brain. Temperament is permanent and unchangeable, 
character is acquired and changeable.

By the time the child has passed about the 18-month mark, the 
child can begin to form permanent  memories and has 
rudimentary cognitive skill. By this time primitive, yet 
intelligible, language skills are developing. The presence of 

58.The appearance of stranger anxiety, also called nine month 
anxiety, provides evidence for the growing recognition that the 
baby and the mother are separate and that the mother is a single 
unique big thing (i.e. adult). 
Obviously choosing nine months, even if it is coincident with an 
adult pattern of brain waves, is not totally correct. Maturation is a 
process and so any end point (here, nine month) means that the 
process started at some earlier stage but it was not apparent. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          377
beginning language skills indicates the maturation of the brain 
that allows for the beginning of the process of conceptualization.

During the period of nine months to 24 months there is the 
first of several explosions of cognitive abilities. By the time the 
second year has passed, the child is now well into what  Mahler 
and her colleagues termed the separation-individuation process. 
Motoric skills allow the child to master the first phase of 
separation-individuation, the distancing sub-phase and also begin 
into the second sub-phase, the practicing sub-phase59. Further, 
motoric skills allow the full emergence of aggression as 
expressed in biting and hitting. 

Now, this is important. What started out as suckling develops 
into biting. What started out as nearly random motor movements 
is now fully coordinated in confident walking and confident 
manipulation of physical objects. 

The child, by 24 months, enters what is commonly referred to 
as “the terrible twos.” The ability to say “no” to instructions and 
invitations is clearly indicative of the maturation and presence of 
a sense of ‘I’ or ego. While the child by 24 months can form 
some permanent memories, the ability to recall these memories is 
limited (i.e. by five or six years of age it is rare that the child can 
recall anything prior to his third birthday).60

Being in the distancing sub-phase of separation-individuation, 
the child is able to and does form permanent but primitive 

59.In Mahler, Pine and Bergman’s (1975) account of the 
development of borderline psycopathology the sub-phases of 
practicing and rapprochement are critical periods.

60.Cognitive psychology draws a clear line between memory storage 
and memory recall. We all learned things in early school which we 
can no longer recall. That we once knew these things speaks to 
memory storage. That we can no longer remember them speaks to 
memory recall. 
It is exactly the same thing as when you put something away but 
can’t now recall where you put it. It is stored somewhere 
(memory) but where (recall). It is the same process we are all 
familiar with when we know someone or some word but can’t, at 
the moment, recall the name or word. Later, it comes to us and we 
say “Oh, now I remember .... ,” but it is not really remembering it 
is recalling. The memory was there all the time, we just could not 
recall it at the moment.



378 Reichian technique, Part Two

concepts about himself and about the world (as manifest by the 
parent(s)). The content of these concepts is critical. They begin 
the formation of the character. Let me provide an example that I 
use when I am teaching parents about how to relate to their child.

All children, as they learn to walk, climb stairs, etc. will have 
many occasions to fall and bump their head. The child will cry 
from the pain. An issue of character formation arises at that time 
(not in a one-off experience, but in the general response of the 
parent). The child has personal knowledge of the extent of the 
pain. What the child does not know, and what it looks to the 
parent to tell it, is “is this pain important” or “is this pain not 
important?” If the parent responds in an exaggerated manner to 
the trivial bump on the head, the child is told by experience and 
observation that (1) pain is an important variable in life and (2) 
he is fragile. In just that one kind of response (to the bump on the 
head) the parent is communicating something about who I (the 
child) am (fragile) and what the world is (pain, more broadly, 
illness, is important). 

This is a basic statement about self and world, but it is not 
conceptualized in this clear adult-like form; it is simple learning 
in the same context as the child is learning language. That is, it 
simply becomes part of the fabric of the child’s being in the same 
sense that his native language does. In a sense, it is associational 
learning. 

if pain -> attracts people
if pain -> important

That is but one example of the process of forming basic 
statements, but statements that, as specific concepts, are 
unrecognized.

The child during the first three to four years of age is a 
learning machine. Not only does language explode in both 
vocabulary and syntax, but so does its understanding of itself and 
the world. Pre-verbal concepts like “am I competent” or “can I 
function on my own” or “do my likes and dislikes make a 
difference” are all forming (along with a host of like pre-verbal 
concepts). 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          379
The crucial point in all this development is that the concepts 

are only minimally verbal (due to the limitations of the child’s 
vocabulary and due to the primitive nature of the child’s 
cognitive process) and as such in being minimally verbal and 
overly global61, they are unrecognized and yet form fundamental 
or basic statements about the self, the world and the relationship 
between the two.

a.     About himself

While the child enters the world with a pre-formed 
personality62, he enters the world with little else. Plato (Secretes) 
and their progeny in the past-lives community not withstanding, 
the child must learn everything. He is biologically programed to 
learn language (Pinker, 1994) as he is biologically programmed 
to learn many other concepts (Gazzaniga, 1992; Gruber & 
Vonèche, 1986). 

One of these learning tasks is to learn who he is. This learning 
task involves much experimentation and trial-and-error learning. 
But he also learns by mimesis, by observing parents and siblings, 
and attempting to copy their behavior. These leaning tasks 

61.One of the characteristic of the toddler’s undeveloped cognitive 
abilities is the characteristic over-generalizations that children 
make. Thus all-four legged animals are doggies. Another 
characteristic of the child’s cognitive world which causes no end 
of character related problems is that ALL children consider 
themselves to be both the source and the object of everything that 
happens to them. While one can not, in logic, be both source and 
object at the same time; still this is the way children inherently 
think and thus innocently form a host of wrong concepts which, 
over time, go to form their character.

62. 60% to 80% of who a person is, is genetic. The word “genetic” 
includes both inheritance as such and effects of a host of factors 
during gestation. Thus if the male child does not develop 
testosterone producing gonads and produce appropriate levels of 
testosterone and certain enzymes at the appropriate time during 
gestation, or the mother over-produces estrogen, ‘his’ brain will 
evolve a female brain pattern and we will get a genetic 
homosexual or trans-sexual (Panksepp, 1998, pp 231-236) 



380 Reichian technique, Part Two

involve an interaction between genetics, parental behavior, 
opportunity, and happenstance.

Take as an example the issue of competence. The question 
that the young child must answer is: am I competent to deal 
effective and properly with the world or am I incompetent either 
in doing most things wrong or in not being able to do things 
without being told how to do them. 

An eloquent testimony to this issue is presented by Holt 
(1964/1983). Holt points out, with criticism, the tendency of 
parents to interfere with the child’s play with a toy to tell him 
how to play “the right way.” The child, playing with the toy in 
the manner which to him seems appropriate (and thereby 
competently), is now told that his method is wrong, he is 
incompetent or he has to be told how to do things properly. This, 
in general, is not one time learning; it is a repeated lesson until he 
knows ahead of time that unless he is instructed in the proper way 
to do things, he will do them wrongly (incompetently). 

Through repeated experience in various areas (including, later, 
school) he forms a concept of himself that becomes one of the 
fundamental building blocks of character. 

But I don’t want to leave the impression that it is only what 
the child is taught. It also includes ideas that the child forms on 
his own as a result of maturation and happenstance.

In this connection, I would relate a story about myself. The 
data for this story was obtained by my use of the first of the self-
exploration techniques I will present later in this chapter.

I was in my fourth year. It happens that two things occur 
during this period. One is the development of the pride system. 
This system develops as a function of brain maturation and is 
influenced by the biological IQ63. The other thing that happens is 
that at this age the child is 50% of its adult height. 

I was playing in the tub and, being proud of how big I had 
become, in my mind I projected myself up to the height of my 
father. That just required a mental doubling of my size. What I 
did not know is that the penis develops disproportionately to the 
rest of the body. So in doubling my height, I innocently (child’s 
lack of knowledge) doubled the size of my penis. I was mortified 

63.Data indicate that IQ is 60% to 80% genetic.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          381
(it was a strong feeling, strongly experienced). When I got to be 
as big as my father, I would have a tiny little penis.

I won’t go into all the ramifications of this erroneous concept 
of myself, but it influenced my behavior all through adulthood 
until, using the recovered memory technique presented later, I 
recovered the memory of that four-year-old experience and was 
able then to explore its effects on me over the years and thus 
correct them.

b.     About the world

For the child, the world is made up of two parts. There is the 
physical world which is predictable and there is the world of 
people which may or may not be predictable (depending on the 
consistency of the parents).

The child has to learn how the physical world operates. That 
learning process goes all the way from the early pleasure of the 
“peek-a-boo” game to the more advanced learning of the 
conservation of volume to the yet more advanced concept of 
cause and effect.64

The child learns how to ride a bike, now to use tableware, how 
to tie his shoes, how to use a chair to reach something in the 
kitchen beyond his reach, how to manipulate objects in his 
mind65 and all the other things we all know about the physical 
world. 

The child must also learn about the world of people. This is a 
far more complex task than learning about the physical world. 
The problem is that people are unpredictable. Parents have 
psychological problems that impact their parenting and they have 
moods that prohibit a task today that was allowed yesterday. Far 
more important, however, is that parents are adults and that is a 
serious problem.

64.The concept of cause and effect can not be taught. It is acquired 
automatically as a function of brain maturation, usually 
somewhere in the child’s ninth year (Gruber & Vonèche, 1986).

65.Mental manipulation of solid objects is one of the sub-tests in the 
WISC IQ test.



382 Reichian technique, Part Two

Before you throw away this book at this point, let me explain. 
I will start with the issue I raised in footnote 64. Prior to 
somewhere in a child’s ninth year, he does not have the concept 
of cause and effect. That requires a bit of amplification before I 
continue. The proper concept of cause and effect is: because of 
the properties of an object, when subject to a particular operation 
(cause) it will respond in a given way (effect)66. Note that (1) the 
concept of cause and effect is not statistical, it is statement about 
the properties of an object such that when subject to a particular 
operation the result is a priori predictable, (2) it is temporal only 
in the sense that at some time in the future the effect will occur 
given that the cause has already occurred, and (3) it is a statement 
about things, not about people’s actions. 

Now prior to the child’s biological-maturational acquisition of 
this concept, the only concept that the child has is one of 
temporal contiguity. That is to say that event (effect) B follows 
after event (cause) A. The child may or may not observe 
regularity of the sequence, but his only context of understanding 
is that of first one and then the other (temporal sequence).

One of the few authors on child raising books who explicitly 
took account of this phenomenon (even if his advice, as we will 
see, was wrong) was Hiam Ginott (1969). Ginott, in giving 
examples of his recommended style of parenting, presents the 
scene where a child is sitting in his high-chair. He has had a glass 
of milk but is still in the high-chair. As will any child, he soon 

66.Windelband, W. (1901/1958). A history of philosophy, Vol II. New 
York: Harper. pp 399-425. Here Windelband discusses the 
modification of the concept of cause and effect from entity and 
action to action and action. At page 410, he writes: “This 
succeeded in the corporal world in a relatively simple manner. In 
this domain, the idea of cause had acquired a completely new 
significance through Galileo. According to the scholastic 
conceptions... causes were substances or things, while effects, on 
the other hand, were either their activities or were other substances 
and things which were held to come about only by such activities: 
this was the Platonic-Aristotelian conception of the airia. Calileo, 
on the contrary, went back to the idea of older Greek thinkers who 
applied the causal relations only to the states – that means now to 
the motions of substances – not to the Being of the substances 
themselves” [italics in the original].



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          383
starts playing with the glass. Shortly it falls and shatters on the 
floor. Ginott’s recommendation to the parent is to say: “Now, 
darling, glasses are not for breaking.” 

Kindly, sweet, understanding; but wrong. It is wrong because 
it assumes the child has the concept of cause and effect. A bright 
five-year-old, when hearing this67, will say: “I didn’t break the 
glass, I pushed the glass off and it broke itself.” To say that if you 
push the glass off then it will break assumes the concept of cause 
and effect (glass is such that given the imposition of rapid large 
force (hitting the floor), it will break). The child has the concept 
of temporality: I did act one (push glass off) and it did act two 
(broke).

As adults, we use the concept of cause and effect so routinely 
in our thinking, that we are not even aware that we are using it 
and even less aware that our child does not have that concept.

Now another example to illustrate another cognitive defect of 
children relative to their adult-thinking parents. 

The child is playing in the living room. The mother sees that 
he is playing with the lamp on an end table. Sternly, she says: 
“Don’t play with the lamp, you’ll break it.” She leaves the room 
and a few minutes later: crash! She runs back in to see the lamp 
smashed on the floor. She scolds, or hits, or demeans or 
otherwise punishes. Her child has directly disobeyed what she 
just told him.

Except that he didn’t disobey. She said not to play with the 
lamp; and he didn’t. He was playing with the space ship. For 
children, reality is not fixed; it is flexible.68 

67.This is not hypothetical. A patient of mine many years ago after 
reading Ginott did start talking in this way to her child. What I 
report of what the child would say is exactly, word for word, what 
her child did say.

68.That is why a child can color the sky purple and does not color 
only within the lines in his coloring book.



384 Reichian technique, Part Two

For an adult a lamp is a lamp and it is always a lamp, even if it is 
sitting on the floor unused in the garage. But to a child, a lamp is 
whatever you fantasize it to be. Reality is not fixed.69

Adult parents are continually using adult concepts with 
children who either don’t know the concept at all or have a 
grossly different context of the concept. Just to emphasize the 
degree of this disjunction, here is a true story about a teen ager 
and her mother.

It happened once when I was sitting in a coffee shop and over- 
heard two mothers talking in the next booth. The one mother was 
relating to the other the big fight she had with her high school 
daughter the previous night.

The mother had reprimanded her daughter for being such a 
“conformist.” Her daughter vehemently denied that she was a 
“conformist” and the fight followed. “But she is a conformist,” 
the mother in the next booth said, “she does everything her 
friends do.”

What the mother did not realize was that she and her daughter 
had different definitions of the word “conformist.” To the mother 
it means: doing what everyone else does. To the daughter it 
means: doing what your mother tells you to do. 

The mother was right to say her daughter was a conformist 
and the daughter was right to say that she was not a conformist. 
They had a fight over a difference in the definition of a word; but 

69.I used to use a therapy technique which I found to be so dangerous 
that I no longer use it. The technique was to sit the patient on the 
floor in front of a low table. I asked the patient to let himself feel 
as though he were a young child. I then watched the face and the 
body language to see when the patient had “regressed” as much as 
he could. I then put a glass on the table and in the sing song voice 
of a parent to a child, said “Here’s you milk, dear.” As with any 
child, my patient would shortly start playing with the glass (I was 
standing behind him or her). At the right point I would approach 
the patient (from behind) and scream “I told you not to play with 
your milk.” It was very effective in producing fear, even terror, as 
the patient responded as a little kid with a big parent standing over 
him and screaming. I stopped using this scene when one of my 
patients was thrown into a full-blown schizophrenic attack in 
response to the scene and I had to spend the whole rest of the 
session bringing her out of her schizophrenic decompensation.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          385
neither of them was aware that the whole of the conflict was 
simply over the meaning (definition) of a word. This example is 
just to emphasize that this conflict of concepts, the adult concept 
versus the child concept, does not stop; it continues up to the mid 
20s when the child’s brain finally reaches its adult form.

Yes, that’s right, the human brain continues to develop and 
rewire into the mid 20s70. The last part of the brain to mature is 
the prefrontal cortex that deals with logical thinking, evaluation 
of the nature and importance of feelings, long-range planning, 
and interpersonal empathy. Teenagers are impetuous and 
generally operate with short-term goals because their brain is not 
yet ready to think otherwise.

Now with that immature brain and with a massive lack of 
knowledge, the child is tasked with making sense of adult 
statements. Mostly, adult statements to a child are pure gibberish 
or are just plain wrong. Yet the child is supposed to make sense 
of them and, inherently, does try to make sense of them. But most 
of the conclusions he draws, most of the concepts he forms, are 
wrong and neither he nor his parents know that the concepts are 
wrong.

In time, if the concepts are concepts about things, reality may 
correct the wrong concepts. But if the concepts are about people, 
no such reality correction is possible. People are so variable, one 
to another, or one over time and circumstances, that the 
concept(s) once formed sets in (into the subconscious) and 
becomes solidified in the character.

There is no issue of repression, or even, directly, issues of 
other defense mechanisms; it is simply knowledge that the 
growing child employs in the same way he employs any other 
knowledge. 

Just as I employed the mistaken idea of the eventual size of 
my penis as an adult and had no conscious memory of the 
incident (until I recalled it by the memory technique presented 
below), so there are for all of us a host of mistaken ideas which 
we have incorporated and retained as elements of our character.

70. Recent research has shown that the brain continues to mature 
until about the age of 25 (Strauch, 2003).



386 Reichian technique, Part Two

c.     About the relationship of the two

I’ve taken quite a few pages to get here, so let me review. 
Character is the result of the unrecognized basic assumptions 
about the self, the world (of things and people), and the 
relationship between the two.

Given who I am and given what the world is, now how can I 
operate in that world? This is the last but most important step in 
structuralizing the character. It is at this point that the defenses71
come forcefully into the picture. That is not to say that defenses 
are not employed all along the way, it is only to say that this final 
step cannot be accomplished without the wholesale use of 
defenses.

As I will discuss in greater detail in the following section on 
defenses, defenses are the method the mind uses — and 
inherently so — to solve logical contradictions. An easy 
example: (1) I am competent and (2) I don’t understand people. 
Now if I am competent then how can it be that I don’t understand 
people? To not understand people is to be incompetent in at least 
one area of living. So how can I be both competent and yet be 
incompetent at the same time? It is a logical contradiction. The 
defense of partitioning solves the problem for me. I am 
competent (with things) and I am incompetent (with people). All 
I have to do (in my character) is to break the world apart into the 
logical categories of things and people and then I can retain my 
assumption of competence by saying that while I am competent, 
people are unpredictable and thus the issue of competence no 
longer applies.72

Since most of the concepts the child forms are erroneous (by 
reason of an immature brain, inadequate knowledge of language, 
and inadequate general knowledge) contradictions between 
concepts are numerous. The greater the number of contradictions, 

71.Later in this chapter I will come to call these “coping 
mechanisms” rather than “defense mechanisms.” The idea of 
‘defenses mechanisms’ is a highly theory-dependent concept. All 
that theory sub-structure and super-structure is unnecessary once 
one comes to regard these mental operations as means whereby 
the person copes with his environment. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          387
the more complex the character and the more it tends to be 
present in layers. It is also the case that the method for resolving 
contradictions is heavily influenced by the child’s native IQ. 
More intelligent people have more complex character systems 
because they are more able to solve contradictions in ingenious 
ways.

In my work as a therapist, it is rare that I have only one 
(character) diagnosis for a patient. To date the record stands at six 
distinct and operative character structures in one person. The 
most common number is three. 

Before I turn to the issue of “character as destiny” let me point 
out that I have gotten here without ever invoking drives or 
energies or instinctual conflict or other of the paraphernalia of 
Freud or Reich or Lowen or Boadella or Keleman or Kurtz and 
Prestera or Kelly73. Just looking at the nature of a slowly 
developing cognitive animal has provided an explanation of 
character, its development, its vicissitudes and the place of 
defenses (except repression). 

4.     On Character As Destiny

It is difficult to communicate in words, absent personal 
revelation or experience, quite how pervasive character is. Freud, 
famously, said “biology is destiny” referring to gender; to this I 
would counter that character is destiny.

Without reservation, everything you are and do is a function 
of, a consequence of, your character. It determines the type of 
work you seek, the romantic attachments you seek, your style of 

72.Obviously a simplified example. Other issues like narcissism and 
injustice collecting can well enter the picture. I can solve the issue 
of other people by projection, as Bergler points out, and hold that I 
am, in fact, competent with people but they are devious and 
therefore set out to hurt me for the very reason that I am 
competent. I can then employ the defense mechanism of either 
reaction formation or counter and enjoy my interpersonal injury as 
proof of the validity both of my competence and the perfidy of 
other people.

73.The one author I can recommend is Totton. He is the author or co-
author of several books, all of which merit reading.



388 Reichian technique, Part Two

dress, your preferences in food and music and leisure, the 
presence or absence of hobbies and your involvement with that 
(those) hobby (hobbies), your style of parenting, your choice of 
friends, your religion or lack thereof, your general demeanor, 
your relationship to your parents and siblings, your reading, 
television watching and movies (liked or disliked), your politics 
(Redding, 2001; Block & Block, 2006), your goals (mainly your 
long-term goals), your philosophy including ethics and morals, 
your attitude toward money (save or spend), your attitude toward 
going to a dentist, your concern with your appearance, all your 
many interpersonal attributes (e.g. self-sacrificing, stubborn, 
suspicious, trusting, gregarious, quiet, etc.) and even, to a not 
insignificant degree, your health (Rossi, 1993).

Is there anything I have left out? Well, include it. I simply 
over looked it; but it is included.

Oh, by the way, it even effects your choice of dream symbols 
and the general nature of your dreams. I have two favorites to 
illustrate the principle.

This female patient brought in a dream where she was 
standing on the top of a tall hotel building in Las Vegas looking 
down at the people splashing around in the pool. Her husband 
was with her but he seemed uninterested in the pool scene. She 
was not afraid of falling nor did she have an impulse to jump.

Just abstract and you have her character right before you. Her 
sense of superiority (looking down on the ordinary people), her 
sense that her superiority was such that anyone connected with 
her was thus also raised to the heights (her husband). Other 
people do not realize the extent of her superiority (her husband 
did not look down). She is confident in her being above everyone 
else (no fear of falling or impulse to jump). Other people are 
frivolous (splashing in the pool) but she is above such mundane 
matters. She knows how to enjoy herself properly (she is in Las 
Vegas) but she has no intention of taking any chances (she does 
not see herself gambling, rather she is at the top of the hotel). 

It is all there, in a nutshell as the phrase is.
Now a very different dream but one that strikes closer to our 

subject. This from a patient in Reichian therapy. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          389
He had been making good progress in the therapy. Not so 

much progress that it worried me; I was comfortable with his 
speed.74 Then he brought in the following dream.

He is driving down an elevated freeway. Suddenly there is an 
earthquake and part of the freeway in front of him collapses and 
disappears. He makes a U-turn onto the freeway in the opposite 
direction. He reaches an exit ramp and pulls off. He then drives 
into a fenced in area like a parking lot and turns off the motor. He 
then just sits there until the possible earthquake is past.

In all my years as a therapist I have never seen a clearer 
resistance dream. He is making progress (driving down the 
freeway), but his whole life is changing (the earthquake) and 
ahead is real danger (the road has collapsed). So he wants to go 
back to an earlier place in his life (the U-turn) and get away from 
the danger of progress (exit the freeway). He wants a safe and 
quiet period (the fenced in lot) where he can rest until the danger 
is over (turn off the motor).

It was nine months before he brought in another dream that 
said he was ready to being progressing again. 

5.     The new view in psychoanalysis

I would close with one more quote showing the changing view 
of character, a view in concert with the one I have been 
presenting (Barnett, 1981, p. 47-49). This change represents a 

74.In Reichian therapy, if a patient is progressing too rapidly he is put 
on vacation from therapy for six months to a year. Recall: 
ALWAYS TOO SLOWLY. The subconscious is a homeostatic 
mechanism with far more power then the conscious and far greater 
access to the body. If it gets too upset by the impact of the therapy, 
it can react by causing physical illness (I make it a practice to 
always get a medical history in the first session) or it can create 
massive levels of upset in the person’s life causing loss of a job 
(and thus a way, for money reasons, to quit therapy) or a break up 
of a marriage. The job of living is living. Therapy that gets in the 
way of living is bad therapy. Whether therapy is done in a 
professional office or is done by ones self at home, if it gets in the 
way of living it is bad therapy.



390 Reichian technique, Part Two

recognition that character is more than simply the by-product of 
the interaction of drive derivatives and defenses.

The concept of character has always been 
undervalued by theorists. Commonly defined as the 
aggregate of traits that distinguish a person, character 
has been seen as superficial and peripheral to the main 
concerns of psychoanalysis. The early instinct-versus-
defense model of psychoanalysis defined character as 
expressions of or defenses against instinctual pressures. 
As a result, character has usually been assigned an 
epiphenomenal role—at most, it has been considered a 
derivative of the functions of the ego and superego. It 
has remained an ambiguous, poorly defined notion, 
peripheral to our theories of mind and of therapy.

The recent growing concern of psychoanalysts with 
epistemic and cognitive issues, however, is beginning to 
effect a change in the orientation toward the concept of 
charac te r .  This  concern  promises  s ign i f icant  
reevaluations of the concept and of its importance to 
psychoanalytic theory and practice.

This chapter will examine the nature and function of 
character as a structural phenomenon related to the 
architectonics of knowing. It will extend observations 
t h a t  h a v e  b e e n  m a d e  r e g a r d i n g  t h e  c e n t r a l  
significance of cognition to the understanding of the 
functioning of the mind and the relationship of the 
concept of character to issues of cognition. It will also 
examine the implications of these views for issues of 
psychodynamics and the therapeutic process.

Psychoanalysis is the study of what, how, and 
why the individual knows and does not know. Its 
theoretical premises include both the fact that early 
experience affects knowing and meaning and that 
subsequent behavior and mental functioning reflect these 
earlier patterns, of meaning. In essence, psychoanalytic 
therapy may be considered an exercise in personal 
epistemology, in which the patient's ways of knowing 
and systems of meaning are explored and understood in 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          391
order to correct dysfunctional mental processes and 
behaviors.

Because its roots lie in clinical observation, 
psychoanalysis, more than the academic psychologies, 
has recognized the importance of sensate experience on 
the organization of meaning in a person's life. Yet, like 
the academic psychologies, psychoanalytic theory too 
narrowly defines cognition as being related simply to 
processes of thinking. Affect, or feeling, has been 
considered an opposing phenomenon to thought, which 
has led, unfortunately and arbitrarily, to the creation and 
institutionalizing of the dualism of thought and feeling.

This dualism and its attendant dialectics have 
a s sumed  unwar r an t ed  p r o m i n e n c e  i n  
p s y c h o a n a l y t i c  t h e o r y  a n d  p r a c t i c e .  I n  o u r  
c o n ceptualizations of personality, cognition is 
equated with thought and is then contrasted with affect 
as ‘an exclusive process.’ Rapaport (1951), for example, 
considers thought and affect as alternate results of delay 
in the gratification of drive tension. The implications of 
‘either—or’ in the production of thought or affect 
pattern may affect many of our clinical and therapeutic 
concerns. Clinically, although it is often contrary to 
observable clinical data, the implied dialectics of this 
approach to thought and affect domin a t e s  o u r  
attitudes toward the problem of character. The 
oversimplification of this approach leads to theoretical 
and clinical impasses.

.... 

Character as a central structural concept 

   To be truly dynamically significant and not just a 
n o s o l o g i c a l  a f t e r thought ,  character  must  be  
distinguished from presenting style (Shapiro, 1965)—it 
must be freed from its definition as merely an aggregate of 
superficial traits. Character is an underlying structural 
phenomenon whose design and formal attributes determine 
much of an individual's mental life. From a structural 



392 Reichian technique, Part Two

perspective, character may be viewed as a behavioral and 
cognitive reflection of the organization of experience in a 
person's life. Character is a template, formed by the impact of 
historical experience. It functions to determine the 
individual's perception, interpretation, and organization of 
ongoing experience, as well as designs of expectation and 
anticipation, behavioral tendencies, and interpersonal 
operations.
   In its cognitive aspects, character represents relatively 
durable patterns of relationships between sensate and 
syntactic experience and the organization of these patterns into 
systems of apprehension and comprehension. It reflects the 
individual's ways of knowing and systems of meaning. 
Ideally, the state of cognition in character organization would 
be an expanding interchange between levels representing 
both sensate and syntactic structure, with each level enriching 
and renewing the other, and each dependent on the other for 
optimal functioning. This ideal model would be an open-
ended system in homeostasis with the environment, restricted 
only. by the inherent limitations of the human organism.
   From a practical viewpoint, however, the study of 
character is more often the study of the limitations and 
distortions imposed by various sources on these systems 
during their development. The delineation of a character type 
implies the existence of a skew in the organization of 
experience, a dysfunctional relationship between sensate and 
syntactic experience that leads to closure rather than to open-
ended homeostasis. To distinguish, therefore, between 
hysterical characters and hysterical neuroses—or between 
obsessional characters and obsessional neuroses—would be 
arbitrary and would ignore the fact that both are structural 
deformations differing only in extent or in the cultural or 
personal bias of the observer.

E.      CHARACTER AND LANGUAGE

This might seem like a strange topic to include here or perhaps 
anywhere. But,  i t  turns out that language is crucial to 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          393
understanding character and especially the relationship of 
character to emotion.75

75.For a recent book on emotion as a function of cognition, see 
Kennedy-Moore, E. & Watson, J. C. (1999). Wong et. al. (2006)  
writes: “The first step of the model concerns a preconscious 
processing of emotional information and automatic physiological 
arousal resulting from a potentially emotion-provoking stimulus. 
For example, a man who is informed about the death of a family 
member might react with affective arousal, resulting in his heart 
beating faster. Nonexpression of emotion can occur simply 
because a person has little or no primary affective reaction to the 
stimulus. Disruption at Step 1 can be measured using 
physiological instruments. . . . The second step refers to one's 
conscious perception of one's affective state. Disruption at this 
step can occur when a person is motivated to block the experience 
of negative emotions from one's consciousness. For instance, the 
desire to avoid perceiving oneself as weak might motivate some 
men to repress their feelings of sadness. Because an individual 
does not consciously recognize these negative emotions, the 
emotions are not expressed. . . . The third step includes labeling 
and interpreting one's affective response, for example, “I feel sad.” 
A disruption at this step occurs when one lacks the skill to label or 
interpret one's emotional experience, thus leading to the 
nonexpression of emotions. For example, some men might 
recognize that they feel something in response to an emotion-
inducing event, but they are unable to interpret their feelings. 
Some scholars have suggested that the construct of alexithymia, a 
deficit in one's ability to put emotions to words, best captures the 
disruption of emotional processing at Step 3.  . . . disruptions at 
Steps 4 and 5 of the KM-W model can be referred to as the 
inhibition or suppression of emotions. Inhibition and suppression 
are fundamentally distinct from repression (disruption at Step 2) 
and difficulty identifying feelings (disruption at Step 3) because 
the nonexpression of emotions at Steps 4 and 5 is conscious and 
volitional (Lumley et al., 2002). Specifically, the fourth step 
involves an evaluation of one's affective response in terms of one's 
beliefs and goals. Disruption at this step takes the form of 
nonexpression resulting from negative evaluations concerning 
emotional expression, for example, “It is wrong for me to feel 
frightened.” In the fifth step, one perceives whether one's 
immediate social context permits the expression of emotions. 
Disruption at this step involves the perception that one lacks 
socially accepted opportunities to express emotions.



394 Reichian technique, Part Two

There are three issues to address: (1) language and metaphor, 
(2) language and identification for the child, (3) language and 
identification for the adult.

1.     introduction

Any discussion of language must begin with a discussion of 
the nature of words and the nature of definition. Except for 
proper names, conjunctions, interjections, indefinite articles and 
the like, all words are the verbal expressions of concepts. That, of 
course, includes verbs and, important in our context, emotive 
words or feeling words [In philosophy a distinction is made 
between words that describe feelings and words that express 
feelings. That distinction is ignored in this discussion.]

A word (that is, a concept) has an explicit definition and an 
implicit definition. The explicit definition is the denotation of a 
word. To denote is, in effect, to point to. The implicit definition is 
the connotation of a word. To connote is, in effect, to imply. It is 
critical that this dual nature of concepts (words) be kept in mind 
in the following discussion.

The denotation or explicit definition of a word is what one 
finds in a dictionary. Any valid explicit definition has two parts: 
the genus and the differentia. The genus says what class of thing 
the concept belongs to. The differentia says what is unique about 
this concept versus the other member of the class.

The usual example of this is the word (concept): table. To be 
formal, here is what my Webster’s says of table: “a piece of 
furniture consisting of a smooth flat slab fixed on legs.” The 
genus, almost always, as here, stated first is: “a piece of 
furniture...” The differentia is: “... consisting of a smooth flat slab 
fixed on legs.” 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          395
So a table belongs to the class: furniture and is different from 
beds, couches, chairs, etc. by reason of the smooth flat slab fixed 
on legs.76

That takes care of the denotation part of a definition, but most 
any definition carries with it connotations, that is, implications. 
Sometimes these connotations are ethical or moral implications, 
usually these connotations imply a context of use such that to use 
the word is to not only convey a concept but also to convey 
associated issues which are not, in a formal sense, part of the 
definition.

Take a word now frequently in the news: hero. The genus of 
hero is “person.” The differentia is “who puts his life in danger in 
order to aid another person.” But there are also connotations. 
Being a hero is good (ethical implication). Another connotation is 
that being a hero means that the person knowingly, not 
accidently, put his life in danger. Yet another connotation is that 
the person had choices available, at the time, in relation to the 
act(s) he undertook. He could, without penalty, have acted 
otherwise.

It is the connotative nature of language (other than pure 
fabrication) that allows for the existence of propaganda.

But we have not exhausted this topic, for there are two types 
of definitions. One is termed “ostensive” the other is termed 
“formal.”

An ostensive definition is one where the definition is 
accomplished not by genus and differentia, but by pointing. A 
formal definition is one containing the standard genus and 
differentia. 

As you’ll see shortly, this discussion of the nature of 
definitions is not without immediate relevance to our topic; the 

76.Obviously, the definition is wrong. A table does not need to be 
fixed on legs. One of the more sophisticated aspects of a definition 
is that it must be based on essential characteristics rather than 
happenstantial or irrelevant criteria. Tables do not need to have 
fixed legs. It does have to have a flat slab and it has to be raised off 
the floor; but there is no reason why a table can not be suspended 
from the ceiling by cables or be a sold block such that there are no 
legs as such.



396 Reichian technique, Part Two

more so, to foreshadow the coming discussion, in that emotions 
are defined ostensively. 

2.    Language and metaphor

If the fact of definitions, if, perhaps, not in the formal sense 
described above, is generally well known, the metaphorical 
nature of language is not as well recognized. The metaphorical 
nature of language is currently a topic of considerable academic 
i n t e r e s t  (Lako f f  &  J ohnson ,  1980 ;  Lako f f ,  1987 ) .  
Communication, in fact language, without metaphor would be 
impossible.77 But, for all the necessity of metaphor, it is also 
prone to gross misuse. In the field of body therapy, to keep to 
that, Lowen bases his whole theory of grounding on metaphor. In 
doing so he erroneously converts metaphor into a statement of 
reality rather than what it is: a device of communicative 
language. 

Reich, of course, does the same thing in translating, after 
Freud, the words: flow, energy, dam up (or block), character, etc. 
from the metaphor they were into statements of fact (that is, 
statements about reality). As we will see when I discuss defenses, 
Reich also made another all too common error of using a 
relatively well defined word in a completely new context (i.e. 
with a completely different definition) without either redefining 
the word (a perfectly acceptable operation) or probably even 
realizing that he was changing the definition of the word.78

It is crucial in critical thinking that both the metaphorical use 
of a word and the connotative versus denotative use of a word be 
ever present in the forefront of one’s thinking.

3.   Language and identification for the child

Consider how, in every culture, we go about teaching our 
young children the meaning of words. Irrespective of where one 

77.Personal communication via email from Dr. Steven Pinker.
78.Reich also had the unfortunate habit of repeatedly using words  

that were totally undefined (e.g. “functional thinking”) or making 
up new terms for well defined concepts (e.g. “work democracy”).



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          397
starts, whether it is things or animals or parts of the body we 
point to it and say the word, subsequently quizzing the child with 
“show me ......” (your nose, the dog, the table, etc.). The general 
and crucial principle is that things that are purely sensory can 
only be defined ostensively. Can you image trying to give a 
formal (genus and differentia) definition of the color: mauve. Or 
a formal definition of D flat as opposed to D natural on the piano. 
One could formulate, and a dictionary does, a formal definition 
of the word “nose” but think about the range of concepts which 
underlie any attempt at a formal definition of the word “nose.” 
The child might well be nine years old before he could being to 
learn the word “nose” if we had only formal definitions to call 
upon. But pointing to it or touching it (a form of pointing) and 
saying the word “nose” and the child has it down by age two.

But there is a better example available to us of this issue and 
how important it is to the process of self-understanding in 
therapy (here, Reichian therapy). Throughout this book I have 
spoken about the ‘ah’ sound. Perhaps you have, or think you 
have, some idea of what that sound sounds like. But you will 
have no question of what it sounds like when you listen to the 
audio that goes with this book. You will then have an ostensive 
definition of that sound. Or take, as similar examples, when I was 
discussing the moan and groan sounds (page 109). There I even 
used the dictionary and, as you may recall, it was little help. But 
listen to the audio and you will know the sound; ostensive 
definition. Any concept which applies to sensory data can only be 
defined ostensively.

Now there are three crucial issues involved here which bear 
directly on the whole process of therapy (whether verbal or body-
based therapy).

The fist issue is that all important emotive words are only 
defined ostensively.

The second issue is that children have a poverty of language.
The third issue is that the ostensive vocabulary of a child is a 

function of the ostensive vocabulary of the parents and of the 
capability of emotive empathy by those parents.

4.    Emotive words have ostensive definitions



398 Reichian technique, Part Two

Emotions79 are internal experiences. They are not only 
sensory and thus have to be defined ostensively; they are a 
particular kind of sensory experience: they are a private sensory 
experience. When we define the word “red” to a child by pointing 
to it, we have a shared sensory experience; it is publicly 
verifiable. Not so with emotions. How does a child learn what 
“shame” feels like? How about sad, happy, lonely, bored, 
unhappy, homesick, guilty, anxious; the list could extend over 
nearly the whole of those over 550 emotive words in the English 
language.

The emotion-word vocabulary of any given individual 
becomes a major factor in a therapy process. Whether it is a self-
directed therapy process as in this book or a formal therapy 
process with a therapist, the process depends on the vocabulary 
of the person having the experience. And that vocabulary, in turn, 
depends on the degree to which they have been taught these 
words and, even more, the extent to which what they have been 
taught is conformant to the common cultural definition.

This last issue, the validity of an emotive vocabulary, becomes 
particularly problematic in self-exploration (whether formal or 
informal). Consider the issue in normal vocabulary. If you do not 
know the meaning of a word, you can go to a dictionary. If you 
think you know the definition of a word, but your definition is 
wrong, perhaps someone will correct your misuse of the word. 
But none of that exploration or correction can occur for emotions, 
for words that can only be defined ostensively. Even if, one adult 
to another, someone says “gee, that must make you sad,” the 
person hearing that statement relates the word to his internal felt 
state. If, previously, by the parents, that particular state has been 
given a different label (definition), then one is likely to get an 
answer such as “no, not really” (for him, this emotive state is 
called futile not sad). The difficulty with emotive ostensive 
definitions, different from all other ostensive definitions, is that 

79.The correct word here is not emotion, it is feeling. I will correct 
that mis-use of the word shortly. I raise the issue here since the 
confusion of emotion with feeling is a rampant error in books on 
body-based psychotherapy.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          399
once a state is mis-identified (mis-defined) it  is almost 
impossible to correct that wrong definition.

5.     Children have a poverty of language

Genetically, by our nature as humans, we have built into our 
brains modules whose task it is to acquire language and syntax 
(Gazzaniga & Heatherton, 2003; Pinker, 1994). All children in all 
cultures acquire vocabulary, syntax, and semantics in the same 
way and in the same order. Obviously they start with nothing and 
by age five have a vocabulary of roughly 2,000 words. However, 
how many of those words are words for things or actions as 
opposed to words for emotive states? It is far easier to learn the 
correct meaning, and to check the accuracy of that meaning, for 
words that are inter-verifiable than it is for emotive words. Here 
the child’s poverty of language can, and often does, extend 
throughout life. This is even more true if the parents have a 
poverty of language. A parent can not teach what the parent does 
not know. Moreover, as noted, if the parent has a mis-
identification of an emotive word that wrong definition will be 
passed on to the child; with no way to check or discover that the 
child (adult) has a wrong definition.

6.    The ostensive vocabulary of the child is a 
function of the ostensive vocabulary of the 
parents and their emotive empathy

That acquisition of definitions of emotive words depends on 
the willingness, sensitivity, and relatedness of the parents to the 
child. The parent teaches the child the definition of emotive 
words by reading the child’s body language, knowing something 
of the circumstances, judging what the child is thinking, and 
having sufficient empathy to the child’s world that the parent is 
aware of the emotional state and is willing to name it. 

Thus parents say to the child things like “you look sad”, “does 
that make you unhappy?”, “does that scare you?” etc. Thus the 
child’s internal state is given a word label by the parent; that is, 
this sensory experience is defined for the child by the parents 
statement.



400 Reichian technique, Part Two

But, like parents teaching a normal vocabulary, irrespective of 
the ability of the parent to emulate the child’s emotive 
experience, they can not name (define) any emotion if it is not 
part of the parent’s vocabulary to begin with. 

7.   Language and identification for the adult

As someone who is a practicing therapist, the extent to which 
people actually have a poverty of language in reference to 
emotive words never fails to surprise me. This happened just two 
days ago. Looking at a patient on the couch, I said (commenting 
on his facial expression) “that looks like anguish.” His response 
was: “what is ‘anguish?’” Whether I was right or wrong in my 
judgment of his feeling state, he had no referent for what I had 
said. The feeling of anguish had never been defined for him.

In dealing with character, and especially in dealing with 
emotions that are associated with childhood experience, the fact 
that the child and now the adult has no vocabulary with which to 
identify or communicate the emotion is of considerable 
importance. It is to be appreciated that while memory storage of 
events is ideographic (i.e. pictorial) the accompanying thoughts 
and emotions are stored linguistically. Lacking the necessary 
vocabulary, the meaning of the event or the thoughts that 
occurred concurrent with the event and which go to create the 
character are not only usually wrong (by reason of the child’s 
limited knowledge and limited cognitive ability) but also are 
often mis-identified by reason of the poverty of language.

The implication of this fact — that you, too, might have an 
unknown poverty of language — will become important 
subsequently when I discuss cognitive self-study. 

F.    DEFENSES

1.     An Introduction To The Idea Of Defenses

The idea of defenses started well before Freud, but it was he 
and his colleagues, especially his daughter, Anna Freud, who 
elaborated on the concept (Freud, A., 1936/1962; Laughlin, 
1979). There is no universally accepted list of defenses (that is, 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          401
coping mechanisms), but the set that I use is presented in a table 
at the end of this chapter.

Entomologically, the very name defenses indicates an attacker 
and a defender. In Freud’s early writing the attacker was 
repressed material from the system unconscious (Ucs) and the 
defender was the system conscious (Cs). 

Later, as Freud revised his theory, but still in his single drive 
theory mode, which was later to be replaced by a dual drive 
theory, the attacker was the drives or drive derivatives from the id 
and the defender was the ego.

In the final dual drive incarnation of Freud’s thinking, the 
attackers were drives and drive derivatives from the id but also 
the unconscious part of the superego while the defender was still 
the ego.

As readers of this book are probably well aware, Reich put 
forth the idea that the character was also a defense, in fact the 
main defense. I will examine that idea subsequently but at this 
point let us just look at the logic of the position (which is not to 
say it is wrong, only, as you will see, that it greatly muddies up 
the water).

2.      Reich’s Redefinition Of Character

In Freud’s formulation (see page 372) the character was the 
result of the operation of defenses; the ego defending against 
drives and drive derivatives. Thus there was an attacker (the id 
drives and their derivatives) and there was a defender (the ego). 
Now, however, in Reich’s addendum, where is the attacker and 
where is the defender? Put another way, if character is the result 
of the operation of defenses, how can it then itself be a defense? 

Note ,  fur ther ,  that  defenses  were  an int ra-psychic  
phenomenon. They served variously to decathect80 ideas, 
memories, or the affective component of those idea or memories; 
to handle conflict between the id and the superego; to placate the 
id with compromise formations where the id got some of what it 
sought if not quite at the moment it sought it or in exactly the 

80.The word “cathect” can be translated as “attach to” and to 
“decathect” is to unattach.



402 Reichian technique, Part Two

form it sought it; and to protect the ego either from emerging 
memories or affect from the subconscious or to protect it from 
un-fulfillable demands of the id. 

But the character is not itself an intra-psychic phenomenon; 
rather it is the result of intra-psychic phenomena. To say that 
character is a defense is to redefine, without notice, the concept 
of defense. That the unrecognized redefinition of words is a 
hallmark of Reich’s thinking hardly needs elaboration. One can 
find it all through his writing. 

How, then, can we reconcile Reich’s redefinition of the word 
“defense” with its normal and accepted meaning?

The answer is that Reich was using the word “defense” in a 
metaphorical way rather than a literal way. The answer becomes 
clearer when we recall that Reich came to the centrality of the 
issue of character both by way of normal free-association 
psychoanalytic practice and by his early (and life-long) focus on 
resistance. He saw, not inappropriately, that the major form of 
resistance to therapy could be found in the character of the 
patient as opposed to the well-known form of resistance in 
psychoanalytic practice: silence or the refusal to accept the 
therapist’s interpretations.

Unfortunately for conceptual clarity, instead of retaining the 
label of “resistance” for the character, he borrowed the word 
“defense” and in doing so redefined the word. 

3.     Reich’s Use Of Redefined Concept Of Character

Defense now became, in Reich’s terms, not an intra-psychic 
process but an inter-personal process, one that could be seen in 
the therapeutic process. Evidence for this is found in Reich’s 
writings as well as in logic. In saying that the therapist had to first 
interpret the character before interpreting the associations, he was 
saying that the first issue of transference to be explored was form 
rather than content. Since the associations contained defenses and 
since the form of the associations was contained in the character, 
therefore character was itself a defense. It was a metaphorical use 
of the word “defense.” Defense now stood not just for the way 
the ego operated under attack by the id or the superego, rather it 
stood for all interactions between the patient and the therapist.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          403
In saying that character was the main defense, Reich was 

actually saying: character is the main resistance. To make such a 
claim is not, in itself, inappropriate or theory-defying; to relabel 
it as a defense, however, is to seriously muddle the issue and to 
invite the kind of criticism to which Reich was subjected.

Had Reich spoken of character as the main resistance instead 
of the main defense, there would be no issue; but he was 
following closely in the footsteps of his mentor, Freud. Thus 
Reich, silently and probably unrecognized by him, was 
redefining a word without notice and using it in a totally theory-
defying manner. 

All of this Reich laid at the feet of repression. Then the other 
body therapy theorists followed Reich into this confusion. But 
Freud’s use of term “repression” was so sloppy that to this day no 
one is able to say what the term means.81 No doubt you, my 
reader, have a personal definition of repression. You think you —
perhaps from reading, perhaps from personal experience, perhaps 
from both — know what repression is. There are, however, two 
big problems with that knowledge. One is that it is not what 
Freud wrote in defining and using the term. The definition in use 
by trained professionals is Freud’s attempt at a definition, not 
your personal one. The second big problem is that your definition 
is colored by your character. Since character (and temperament) 
underlies everything, it also underlies your personal definition of 
repression and that definition, being personal, is not public. 

Nor does it solve the problem to say you are using Reich’s 
definition. Reich never explicitly defined repression, he simply 
used the term in an uncritical acceptance of Freud’s use of the 
term and, as mentioned, Freud’s use of the term was so sloppy 
and inconsistent that to this day no one is able to say what it 
means. 

4.     Defenses And Their Role

a.     A cognitive theory of defenses

81.See: Madison, 1961; Erdelyi, 1990. 



404 Reichian technique, Part Two

The concept of the defense mechanism, while it started out as 
virtually a synonym for repression, was gradually elaborated over 
time and over non-compatible theories to become a general 
method whereby the ego (in Freud’s last revision of his 
theoretical system) protected itself from demands by the id and/
or the superego. 

Once Freud started out on the path of energy buildup and 
discharge, of cathexis and counter-cathexis, he was trapped in his 
own Helmoltzian82 quagmire. As Webster (1995) shows with 
majestic prose and wide erudition, Freud’s attempt to surmount 
religion was actually an unrecognized and thus covert expression 
of his Judeo-Christian ethos. The Judeo-Christian split of good 
and evil, of fallen and saved mankind, was recast in the form of 
the evil id and the struggle to surmount the inherently untamed 
and fallen id by the rational ego whose job it was to resolve the 
conflict between the devil in the id and God in the superego. God, 
the father, became god the male parent whose praise and love we 
sought by taming our fallen base nature in identification with our 
father god.

There is another answer to the human condition. But not just 
another answer; more an answer that recognizes the immense and 
arguably beautiful complexity of human behavior. One that, 
while recognizing the presence of defense mechanisms (I’ll 
rename them shortly) also recognizes that we are neither fallen 
nor risen up but that we, each of us in our own time and way, 
does the best he can to cope with the life he finds presented to 
him by evolution, by his unique genetics, by his culture, and by 
the happenstance of his life. 

82.It is widely noted that Freud developed his concept of energy 
movement and blocking from the physicist, Herman von 
Helmholtz. The concept of energy employed by Freud and 
accepted by Reich was modeled on the way that water flows. That 
is the water has a certain energy, direction, and obstruction. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          405
The term “defense mechanism” is hallowed by age and use. It 

has now a history of over 200 years. Yet, I submit, still it should 
be abandoned since it carries with it the baggage of Charcot’s83
manifest errors and Freud’s elaboration on those errors. It carries 
with it the idea of unmeasurable and unobservable energies that 
are subject to laws of movement and stagnation, of push and 
counter-push, of flow and blockage, of build up and release; all 
the while subjugating humans to be but little more than passive 
objects of these energies which we can, at best and often 
unsuccessfully, attempt to channel in constructive ways.

I suggest in the place of defense mechanisms, the phrase: 
“coping mechanisms.” As humans we have potentialities and 
limitations, we find ourself as babies, toddlers, youngsters, 
teenagers and adults in an ever-changing environment presenting 
new and unlearned challenges with which we cope, with greater 
or lesser success. We, each of us, do our best to find a path 
through the labyrinth of life that leads to other than another dead 
end. Through all the challenges, we have but one constant 
companion, we have but one companion that gives us some 
surcease from the challenge that the events of each day present: 
our magnificent mind, our ability to think, conceptualize, 
analyze, learn and understand, view with awe, with amazement, 
with pleasure, and, often and unfortunately by our nature, with 
failure. We seek, each in his own way and to the best of our 
ability at any given time, in success and failure, in health and in 
sickness, in celebration and dejection, to puzzle out a way to cope 
with what life has thrown at us. 

But for all the wondrous scope of our minds, our ability to 
look back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time and see how 
time and evolutionary adaptation have brought us to this 
pinnacle, still that mind is burdened with the remnants of that 
heritage. Evolution does not discard, it modifies. So we find a 
frontal brain that can lay plans for a lifetime and a primitive 
amygdala (to pick just one of the many residues of evolution) that 
engenders inappropriate and unnecessary fears. The point is, 

83.Freud was very heavily influenced by the French physician, Jean-
Martin Charcot. For a discussion see: (Ellenberger, 1970; 
(Macmillan, 1997; Sulloway, 1979).



406 Reichian technique, Part Two

humans are a magnificent mess. One of us can create a statue of 
David while another can create a Koran that proclaims hatred and 
death. One of us can secrete himself for years in an attic to solve 
Fermat’s Last Theorem (math problem) while another figures out 
how to kill and maim as many as possible with a personal bomb. 

Freud’s postulation of an id, an ego, and a superego is not a 
bad metaphor. If the structures as such do not exist, their function 
does in the form of many structures communicating over 100 
billion neurons and synapses; and from that melange comes our 
greatness and our pathology.

The psychology of coping provides a way to not just discover 
— something that would in any case be a first step in the process 
in that for good thinking facts must proceed theory — but 
actually to logically derive the coping (nee:  defense) 
mechanisms. I will not take you through the whole process here 
for that would be more tedium than enlightenment; but I will deal 
with just one to display the process.

The human mind, by its nature, seeks coherency. As one 
neuroscientist put it “Humans are pattern-seeking animals.” 
Where explanation is lacking, an explanation will be supplied. It 
is that brute fact that accounts for the fact that in every culture 
ever studied we find religion. If I find rain and lack of rain, I will 
invent a rain god that prevents or brings on the rain. If I find 
death, I will invent a spirit or soul that does not die. If I find 
people whose behavior is inexplicable, I will invent daemons that 
have invaded the person and are causing the strange behavior.

As a child you are presented with a multitude of incompatible 
concepts and told that all these incompatible concepts are true. 
When you are very young, you just accept because your mind is 
not yet sufficiently developed (that is, matured) for you to clearly 
recognize that the ideas are incompatible. But by the age of 
between seven and ten (7, 8, 9) you do start to recognize logical 
incompatibility84. 

For discussion purposes, we will label two concepts as are θ 
and λ. You are told by the all-knowing adults that both are true. 
But you have reached the age where you recognize that both 
can’t be true. They are incompatible. The mind goes to work to 
solve the conundrum.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          407
Now θ and λ can not, in logic, both be true at the same time. 

How can that child cope with the contradiction? One way is to 
dismiss (deny) either θ or λ. We have the coping mechanism of 
denial. Another way is to say that θ is true for me but λ  is true for 
you. We have the coping mechanism of projection. 

In this way, and adding a bit of learning theory, all the coping 
mechanisms can be derived from logic and the simple 
proposition that the human mind is cognitive. We have no need 
of unobservable energies, of cathexis and counter-cathexis, of 
energy build-up and build-down; no need of all the definitionally 
and logically sloppy paraphernalia of Freud or Jung or Reich or 
Lowen. Human beings make sense and, in the process, we can 
retain our all too human admiration for the adaptability and the 
inventiveness of this crazy animal, the human (Kagan, 2006).

b.    Why focus should be on the 41 coping 
mechanisms other than repression

The concept of repression is, at best, dubious. Even if present 
and even if in wide use, therapy focus on this mechanism is 
fruitless.

First, I remind you that the theory of repression is and was a 
theory of willed forgetting of memories or ideas. The claimed 
reason for repression was that the memory or idea produced 
unpleasant affect. By removing the memory or idea from 
consciousness, the resultant or accompanying unpleasant affect 
was prevented.

Reich started his body-based psychotherapy as a way to get at 
the character. As he developed his Orgone theory, he changed his 
theory of the therapy from a way to deal with character to a way 
to de-repress blocked emotions (or blocked Orgone streaming if 
you prefer). His rationale is summed up in a series of diagrams he 

84.f presented concepts are blatantly obvious contradictions, then the 
mind even as early as age two can recognize the fact of 
contradiction. Contradictions can also arise between one’s 
inherent needs and desires and what is in-the-home accepted or 
sanctioned. The book by Mahler, Pine and Bergman (1975) is 
highly recommended.



408 Reichian technique, Part Two

drew showing anger being prevented ways to vent and thus 
turning back on the Rousseauian natural self.85

Let’s suppose that one works in the therapy, or approaches the 
therapy, in the emotion-releasing paradigm of, after Reich, all the 
body-based psychotherapy modalities. Further let’s suppose one 
is constricted in thinking about this emotion-releasing model to 
just anger, fear, and self-pity (weeping). In this model of human 
psychology, what has happened to learning? what has happened 
to thinking? what has happened to insight? what has happened to 
morality? to ethics? to esthetics? what has happened to 
temperament (James, 1880/1918)? what has happened to organic 
pathology of the nervous system (even as simple an issue as 
having pollen allergies impacts one’s work and even one’s place 
of living)? but especially, what has happened to the very real 
possibility (I would say, the fact) that Reich’s developmental 
scheme is wrong? 

If Reich and his progeny are correct that emotional acting-in is 
somehow curative, then the therapy will do its work irrespective 
of any argument I have put forth that the relevant issue is 
cognition, not emotion. On the other hand if what I have put forth 
on the cognitive issue being central to human psychology and 

85.For argument’s sake, let me grant Reich’s model of human 
psychology and his idea of blocks to Orgone flow as being the 
essential element in human psychology. Here is what is missing 
from this picture: (1) what of the other over 549 emotions; do they 
have no effect and no relevance?; (2) what of the fact that Reich 
found that the method did not, in fact, cure (his ‘bent tree’ 
analogy)?; (3) what of all the other defense (coping) mechanisms 
that everyone else finds present in human psychology; they quietly 
disappear without comment; (4) what of the total lack of empirical 
evidence for Reich’s anger postulate?; (5) what of evolution and 
genetics and the fact that they are missing from Reich’s 
formulation?; (6) what of the reductionism contained in Reich’s 
formulation, that his theory reduces human life to blocks or the 
orgasm reflex leaving no room for the immense variability that 
one finds in practice (7) what of Reich himself, being raised in a 
sex-negative (his term) patriarchal system, and yet claiming that 
he was orgasticly potent thus inherently saying that the theory 
either is false or does not work in the if->then axiomatic way that 
he postulated.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          409
that the therapy simply facilitates one’s ability to discover his 
own cognitive errors by removing habituated patterns of 
character that conceal the erroneous errors of thinking, then one 
has by utilizing the techniques put forth in this chapter on the 
cognitive work of self-therapy gained the benefit of both theories. 
Put briefly, the theory I have put forth in this book is a no-lose 
proposition.86

If repression is real, important, and is addressed by the body-
based psychotherapy; then you have that in hand. If repression is 
a false concept or is of marginal importance then by focusing on 
the postulated cognitive issues involved in psychopathology you 
have the best of both theories. You can’t lose in thinking that 
thinking is the crucial issue. And, in our context here, thinking 
means focusing on at least a few of the more important of the at 
least 41 identified coping mechanisms other than repression.

c.    The most important of the coping 
mechanisms in terms of self-therapy

Different people characteristically employ different coping 
mechanisms. Even within the same person, mood can change the 
prevalence of observed use of coping mechanisms. Moreover as 
the Reichian therapy proceeds, one can measure the change of 
character by the change in the use of coping mechanisms. What I 
am going to do here is highlight only the most important of the 
list of coping mechanisms (page 461). These are the ones that are 
most frequent and which will, by your learning them and learning 
to observe their use, provide you with the maximum benefit with 
the minimum of psychic cost.

Before I start on this list, I want to issue a caution. I will 
discuss this at greater length in the TECHNIQUE section 
(starting on page 418) of this chapter, I want merely to mention it 
here as a precaution. The tendency of anyone seeking to 

86.n using the word ‘curative’ I am aware that I am not addressing 
the argument put forth in a life-time’s of writing by Thomas Szasz 
and his trenchant claim that we have erroneously medicalized 
choice and morality. To use the word ‘cure’ is to presume that 
psychology is a medical issue rather than a moral issue.



410 Reichian technique, Part Two

understand and correct himself is to make changes whenever he 
locates a mistaken or non-functional aspect of himself. DON’T 
DO IT! The goal of self-study is to gather data. I repeat: the goal 
of self-study is to gather data. If you volitionally make changes in 
yourself all that you will accomplish is to hide the issue (what 
Freud termed: symptom substitution). As I discussed previously, 
character is destiny. Your character is pervasive in all the big and 
little things in your life. If you stomp on one manifestation, you 
will simply be missing the other manifestations. 

On the other hand if you simply collect and collate data, you 
will, in time, simply change at the character level and it will be 
permanent and pervasive. This is just a heads up, I will spell this 
out in the section on technique.

In this section, I will present only the most important coping 
mechanisms. In the technique section I will discuss how to learn 
to watch for your use of these mechanisms and how to 
manipulate the data.

i.     projection

To project is to place your own state into another person. By 
use of the word ‘state’ I mean ideas, opinions, moods, desires, 
intentions, feelings, expectations, intentions or, in general, any 
other mental content. Projection is ubiquitous. 

ii.    introjection

To introject is to take a perceived or imagined or hypothesized 
aspect of another person and put it into your self. 

Empathy is a sophisticated form of introjection where one 
judges or imagines another person as having a certain feeling 
state, one introjects that feeling state and then responds to the 
other person from the point of view of having that feeling state. 

iii.   reaction formation

In reaction formation one converts something into its 
opposite87. The choice of what-is-the-opposite-to-what is a 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          411
matter of some subtlety. I will address that question in the 
technique section.

iv.   life-style repetition compulsion

There are two forms of the repetition compulsion88. The 
statement of the life-style repetition compulsion is one of the few 
coping mechanisms that has an exact definition. That definition 
is: any condition that has been experienced for an extended 
period of time comes to be regarded as the natural, the normal, 
the to be expected.

You can read an example of the life-style repetition 
compulsion in the story of Betty that I presented in Chapter one 
(page 7). For example: “her preferences... were either of no 
consequence or were wrong... Betty soon stopped trying to form 
her own judgements... she grew to ignore any desires of her 
own.”

Betty’s desires, her likes and dislikes, were always ignored 
and thus she came to regard  her own desires as of  no 
consequence. As her mother treated her, so she treated herself89. 
Because of the life-style repetition compulsion, in life as an adult 
Betty would display an indifference to her clothes; she would 
have little preferences in food; she would rather be directed than 
make a decision; she would be generally passive; she would — 
and this is the most important issue in life style repetition 
compulsions — be anxious if she had to depend on her own 
decisions.90 

87.The mechanism of ‘counter’ is very close to reaction formation. 
The subtle distinction is not relevant to our discussion.

88.Freud did not draw this distinction. However, the psychodynamics 
of the life-style repetition compulsion and the incident repetition 
compulsion are sufficiently different that a distinction is 
important.

89.Yes, one could also say that this was an issue of incorporation or 
of identification, but life-style repetition compulsion is a wider 
concept than are incorporation or identification.



412 Reichian technique, Part Two

v.    incident repetition compulsion

An incident repetition compulsion is the repeating, in 
symbolic form, of an incident wherein you, as a child, did not get 
the desired result. 

As you study yourself, and if you do it with appropriate 
dedication and focus, you will, over time, find that incident 
repetition compulsions are found repeatedly. Unraveling your 
incident repetition compulsions is arduous work. The degree to 
which the incident is symbolized makes discovery difficult.

Another sticking point of significance about the incident 
repetition compulsion is that it can never be satisfied. Even if one 
were exactly to replicate the initial scene and get exactly the 
response one initially sought, the incident would not be closed. 
Even though the scene is exact, you wanted the response when 
you were seven (to give it an arbitrary age) and getting it at 25 
does not (internally) make the scene complete. But, more than 
that, the scene can never even be exactly repeated. It happened 
when you were seven and replication at 25 is not an exact 
replication.

I’ll make up another ‘patient’ story to illustrate the point.
Mark liked to play baseball. Generally he was not that good at 

it, but that did not stop him from enjoying his time in the field 
and his time at bat. Then there was that one play; that one time 
that he caught a ball that, he thought, no one would ever have 
guessed he could do. He expected everyone to be very impressed 
by his special accomplishment. What he got was just one of the 
other kids saying: “hey, good catch.” 

Now he did not continue through life playing baseball. To the 
contrary, since he was not that good at it, he soon realized that he 
was not a sought-after player and he turned to other activities. As 
far as his parents knew, he “simply lost interest in baseball.”

90.Contrary to what Reich, Lowen, and some of the other body-based 
therapists have written, the most important emotion is anxiety. 
Humans do more to avoid anxiety than any other emotion or 
feeling.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          413
But baseball was only the setting for the incident, the essence 

of the incident — the plot of his life’s novel — was that you do 
things that other people expect can’t be done and you don’t get 
the recognition for it.

There is much more to say about this mechanism, but I’ll hold 
that off in order to start the techniques section. We’ll come back 
to Mark.

G.     EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE

The word “experience” is ambiguous.   In some contexts it 
means an event, synonymous with the word “occurrence.”  If we 
ask someone: “have you ever experienced a death in the 
family?”, we are using the word in the context of occurrence.  In 
other contexts it means the subjective state accompanying or 
resultant from an occurrence.  An example would be “how did 
you experience the death of your father?”  In other cases, it is 
used as though the only response to an occurrence could be an 
emotion; as in “what did you experience when you attended the 
funeral?”  The concept underlying defense mechanisms employs 
the word “experience” in a broader context.  It includes: (1) the 
occurrence, (2) the thoughts present at the time of the occurrence, 
(3) the emotions present at the time of the occurrence, (4) the 
thoughts and emotions arising subsequent to the occurrence but 
resultant from the occurrence.  Thus the four steps following the 
loss of a loved one91 of denial, depression, anger, resolution are 
all part of the same “experience” in the context of understanding 
defense mechanisms.  To avoid this ambiguity, the word 
“experience” when used below should be taken to mean all four 
of the above elements.  The “experience” means (1) occurrence, 
(2) thoughts at the time, (3) emotions at the time, (4) subsequent 
thoughts and emotions directly resultant from the occurrence.

1.     Feeling(s)

91.First enunciated by John Bowlby and taken up and popularized by 
Kubler-Ross.



414 Reichian technique, Part Two

If the term “experience” is filled with ambiguity, the word 
“feel” is almost so definitionally over-loaded in English (and 
perhaps in all languages) that its very use becomes problematic.

Here again we must look both to the denotation and the 
connotation. In denotation, to feel is to have a sensory 
experience. We can, properly, use the word for tactile sensations 
(“feel this fabric”), for issues of physical health (“how do you 
feel”) or for emotions (as sensory experiences)92. But that is only 
the denotation.

There is a far more pernicious use of the word when we 
examine its connotation. The error of use is contained in two 
common phrases: “how does that make you feel” and “I feel that 
... .” The error is present in both phrases, but in a different form.

a.     How does that make you feel

The major connotative (actually, logically implicit) error in 
that use of the word “feel” is the idea that feeling are effects of 
which others actions or events are the cause. In this context one is 
speaking of a physics concept of cause and effect; of action and 
reaction. It treats the person possessing a given feeling as the 
passive recipient, the effect of a cause outside of the person’s 
discretion. In another way of looking at it, it is a Skinnerian 
concept of one behavior resulting as a reinforcer or inducer of 
another behavior (here the behavior being a “feeling”.) 

The “feeling” is not the responsibility of the person having the 
fee l ing,  the  fee l ings  i s  s imply an  axiomat ic ,  even i f  
individualized, response to a stimulus. There is no context of 
being able to think (in which case the appropriate question would 
be: what did you think about that?). There is no context of 
judgement or of opinion or of evaluation, there is only an 
idiosyncratic (and omnipotent) response. 

As I have implicitly argued in this book, the major operative 
fact of the human, the one fact which is requisite to any study of 

92.Recall that emotion and feeling are different concept. One can 
have an emotion without a feeling. Feeling is the cognitive or 
conscious recognition of an affect or an emotion.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          415
sociology or anthropology or education or psychology, is that 
humans are thinking animals. We are not made to feel anything.

Eloquent testimony to this fact is the response of people in 
New York interviewed in the immediate aftermath of the Twin 
Towers incident. When asked by television reports “how do you 
feel?” many people responded with “I don’t know what to feel.”

Consider that response. What does that answer say about the 
nature of emotion? “I don’t know what to feel.” It says, 
obviously, that thinking is involved in feeling; but more 
importantly it says that feelings are partially a social construct.93
One has to know before hand what feeling is culturally approved 
before one creates that feeling and reports it. I will shortly (page 
421) discuss current competing theories of emotion and note that 
one of them is that they are social constructs.

But above all, that “I don’t know” response indicates that the 
“made to feel” concept is erroneous. 

Allow me to contrast the “made to feel” concept with a recent 
incident with a patient and my response and why that response 
changed the whole issue.

The patient’s father had died in the week between sessions. 
Not surprisingly, his first comment to me at session was “my 
father died last week.” Had I said to him “how do you feel about 
that?” or “how did that make you feel?”, I would have been 
linguistically demanding that he have an emotion in respect to the 
death94. To either question, he would by social convention, have 
had to locate and give voice to some feeling. At most, had he 
been socially daring, he might have said: “nothing much.” 

93.Like all things in psychology, alternate explanations would appear 
to have equal validity. It is extraordinarily rare in psychology that 
any study or proposal is not challenged by alternate explanations. 
Here, “I don’t know what to feel” might just as well mean that 
there is such a mixture of feelings that the speaker is unable to 
settle on just one. By a like token it can mean that while the 
feeling are, in fact, known to the speaker, he (she) is unwilling to 
give voice to those emotions lest the answer reflect badly on the 
speaker.

94.For how this component of language led Freud into a major error 
in understanding “little Hans,” (Freud, 1909/1955) see: Bilge, 
1999.



416 Reichian technique, Part Two

Instead my question to him — a question that freed him from the 
whole incident — was “is that a good thing or a bad thing?” 

That caught him off guard. He considered it for a moment, and 
said “it’s a good thing.” In other words, I asked for an evaluation 
of the incident rather than an emotional response to the incident. 
Recognizing that the death was actually better for both him and 
his ailing father, allowed the whole incident, the death, to pass 
without any need to fabricate any emotional response.

b.     I feel that...

This is a term used by women almost exclusively (though men 
are starting to learn to use it). The connotative meaning of the 
phrase is that feelings are (1) unquestionable, (2) a justification 
for any action and (3) a magical incantation that dispenses of any 
judgement, evaluation, opinion or thought. 

Worse, it turns the word “feeling” into a metaphor. Consider 
this phrase: “I feel that he doesn’t like me.” Now search as you 
will through the list of over 550 emotions or though books on 
emotion, you will never find an emotion called “doesn’t like me.” 
The word “feel” here is being used instead of “I think” or “in my 
opinion” or “as far as I can tell” or “it appears that.” But when the 
issue is cast in the form of a feeling instead of an opinion or 
evaluation of evidence, it then becomes unquestionable; it is a 
magical incantation to ward off any inquiry. Yes, the interlocutor 
could say “what ‘makes’ you feel that?” but the response of “that 
is just the way I feel, that’s all” is considered acceptable and 
again unchallangable. The question in response to “I feel that he 
doesn’t like me” would never be “what evidence do you have for 
that opinion?” 

Feeling are treated as private, unquestionable, and inherently 
valid: “I feel that way, that’s all!”

2.     Emotional Lability

Emotions, as discussed in this chapter and in Chapter one, are 
the result of cognitive appraisal. Further, emotions are circular in 
that one emotion can be subject to a coping mechanism and be 
converted into another emotion which, in turn, can be subjected 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          417
to another coping mechanism and appear as yet a different 
emotion or attitude. Thus one can take anxiety, apply the 
mechanism of reaction formation to convert it into bravado. The 
bravado can then be subjected to the mechanism of secondary 
gain and be converted into pride. 



418 Reichian technique, Part Two

The pride can then be subject to the mechanisms of projection 
and introjection where it becomes haughty95. Then the attitude of 
haughty can be amplified by the coping mechanism of 
justification and then subjected to undoing and/or denial and/or 
sublimation to become the character trait of condescension. In 
condescension the underlying character trait of haughty is 
disguised under the personality trait of being willing to give 
everyone a chance to be heard96 when, in psychological fact, the 
“hearing” is only an excuse to (justifiably) dismiss. A cascading 
of mechanism on mechanism is the rule not the exception.

III   TECHNIQUES SECTION

95.The pride is projected into a parent where it becomes, in terms 
used by Heniz Kohut in his writings on self psychology, an 
“idealized parent imago.”  This idealized parent is then introjected 
where it becomes a conviction that our family is superior to other 
families.  Thus we get to haughty.

96.This corresponds both to Jung’s “identification with the persona” 
and with Adler’s “superiority complex as a defense against an 
inferiority complex.”

Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          419
First, I am going to present a technique for recovering 

memories (not repressed memories, just not remembered 
memories which formed the basis of your character)

Then, I will present a fine but almost ignored technique 
developed by Alfred Adler (Ansbacher & Ansbacher, 1956; 
Stepansky, 1983).

Next, I will discuss a technique put forth by George Weinberg 
(1969),

Finally, I will attempt to put it all together and lay out a plan 
for you to use to deal with the mass of material that body-based 
psychotherapy does not deal with.

A.     RECOVERING MEMORIES

Now this is, strictly, not part of Reichian. It is an extension 
based on the underlying theory of the therapy (which was not 
known to Reich who, after all, died 50 years ago and was 
educated about 85 years ago. We have come a distance since 
then).

The purpose of this technique is to recover the memory of the 
incident or thought that now forms a part of your character (and 
your emotional reaction to events)97.

97.The evidence from psychological research is uniform and 
overwhelming in quantity that memory is not veridical. That is, 
memory is not true to fact; it is a reconstitution out of distortions 
and fragments rather than being accurate. It is distorted by time, 
by emotional states (both at the time the event supposedly 
occurred and subsequently), and it is very highly subject to 
suggestion. For an investigation of the (in)validity of recovered 
memories, see the references in footnote 111 on page 446. That 
memory is not veridical makes no difference to psychology. That 
is to say, you have and believe the memory and therefore whether 
it is or is not accurate makes no difference as far as psychology 
and character is concerned. The importance of realizing that 
memory is not veridical is that when you recover a (supposed) 
memory, don’t treat it as a fact. Rather treat it as a valuable tool to 
explore your own psychology. The issue is not what happened to 
you; the issue is what purpose does this memory serve in my 
psychology and character. A further use of memory is explored in 
section III C, the Adlerian Early Memory Technique.



420 Reichian technique, Part Two

Contrary to some of the Reichian exercises, there is no danger 
in this technique and, aside from becoming obsessive about using 
it, you can apply it at any time.

Rather than making you read through the theory before getting 
to the technique, I am going to present the technique first and 
follow it with the theory. When you get to the theory, if you like, 
you can just skip it and go on to the rest of the chapter.

This technique will not work when you are in the grip of 
conflict or strong feeling. However, you can make a mental note 
of the conflict or feeling, come back to it latter when things have 
calmed down, and then apply the technique.

Some people are successful right off with this technique, 
others require years of the Reichian exercises before they are 
sensitive enough to their body states to be able to use the 
technique. In either case it does not hurt to try it right after you 
read this part two of the chapter and see whether it works for you.

1.     The Technique

1. Sitting quietly and without distraction turn your attention 
to your body. Just sense all the parts of your body: your neck, 
your arms, your legs, your feet, etc. 

2. Find any little area of tension in your body. It can be 
strong tension or minor tension, it does not matter. It can be your 
fist, it can be your calf, it can be your chest; it can be any large or 
small part of your body.

3. At this point there are two ways to proceed to arrive at the 
same data. What you want to do is name the tension. That is you 
want to put either a single emotion word on the tension or a short 
action-descriptive phrase.

One technique is to ask yourself: what does that part of 
my body want to do if it had its own will power, its own ability to 
perform an action. This is good for people who think verbally.

The second technique is to picture a blank black board 
and let a word be written on that board that names or describes 
that tension.

Keep in mind that the goal is to put an emotive word on 
the tension or a short action-like phrase (at most three words, 
hopefully one word). Some made up examples to illustrate. I find 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          421
tension in my right calf muscle. I ask what it wants to do and find 
the answer is that it wants to play “kick the can.” The emotion: 
child-like fun. I sense my body and find some hard to pin down 
feeling in my abdomen. What does it want to do? It wants to cry. 
The emotion: sadness or depression. I sense my body and find the 
back of my neck is tense. What does it want to do? It wants to 
keep my head attached to my body. The emotion: stubborn 
control.

4. Having identified the feeling, now spread that one feeling 
over the whole of your body. Let every part of you want to do or 
feel the same thing. It you find that this scares you, makes you 
very nervous; just stop the exercise. There is always tomorrow.

5. Now that one feeling is everywhere in your body. While 
holding on to that over all state, now again sense your body. You 
will find a new area of tension.

6. Again by using ‘what does it want to do’ or ‘what word 
gets written on the black board’, name that new tension (as a 
feeling or an action).

7. Now put the two emotions together. When did you feel 
both of these emotions together at one time? Usually with just 
two passes (initial emotion and subsequent emotion after 
spreading) you will recover a memory. Sometimes it takes three 
passes but usually two is enough. 

8. Hold on to that memory and examine in what way it has 
influenced your life, in what way has it been or is it being 
expressed in your way of being in the world. What you have 
accomplished here is finding that incident in your life which got 
built into your character and is today determining your way of 
being.

That’s it. That’s the whole technique. But, boy, can it yield 
dividends if you make real use of the recovered memory. The 
technique was one I developed, but it is based on loads of 
research in psychology, on major theorists of emotion,  and on 
philosophers who have taken the issue of emotion as a major area 
of study.

2.     The Theory



422 Reichian technique, Part Two

There are six major theories of emotion (Cornelius, 1996): (1) 
Darwinian, (Darwin, 1872/1965), (2) James-Lange (James, 1884; 
Lange & James, 1922; cf Schacter & Singer, 1962), (3) cognitive 
(Izard, 1977; Lazarus, 1991; Ben-Ze’ev, 2000), (4) social 
constructivist (Harre, 1986; Gergen & Davis, 1985), (5) emotive 
neuroscience (Panksepp, 1998; Lane & Nadel, 2000) and (6) 
evolutionary psychology (Barkow et. al., 1992). All of them have 
evidence for them and evidence against them. We are still feeling 
our way when it comes to emotion. The theory here is agnostic 
about which of those six theories is the most correct; to the 
contrary the theory here is mostly a blending of all six theories.

The technique is based on a theory of both the way the mind 
works and on the nature of emotion in relation to man, a 
cognitive animal.

This could be an immensely long discussion dealing with all 
the variables and their interaction; but the only purpose I have 
here in presenting any theory at all is to justify the utility of the 
technique. To explain how I came to it, why it works, and why it 
is useful.

I take it as proven that there is a subconscious. It is the 
repository of our experiences and our thoughts about those 
experiences.

I also take it as proven that each person is 60% to 80% 
genetics and 20% to 40% environment. Our personal life 
experiences, our personal environment, works on our personal 
genetic predispositions to form who we are at any given time.

Now I need to introduce a concept put forth by a once famous 
and now obscure philosopher, Sir William Hamilton. He 
proposed that we store information as a gestalt. That is, we don’t 
store in our subconscious isolated bits of data, rather we store 
complete scenes as a unit. Sir Hamilton’s term for this was 
“redintegration.”

Let me illustrate that. I would ask you to recall the first two 
wheel bicycle you ever got. It you picture that bike, you will find 
that you don’t just see the bike, you see a complete scene. For 
me, it is the basement in which I stored the bike when I was not 
riding it. It is also riding alone down the street without my hands 
on the handle bars; I see the buildings on each side of the street, 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          423
the summer sun and the clear blue sky. I store these scenes as 
gestalts, as whole scenes.

But that is not the whole of the gestalt. It also contains the 
emotions I was feeling at the time. It was the pleasure of seeing 
the bicycle in the basement, it had not been stolen. It is the joyous 
freedom and pride of riding my bike without my hands on the 
handle bars and the freedom of doing things my way; with no 
parent or adult to tell me I could not do it.

Now one more basic element of the theory. Data in the 
subconscious is stored as a branch tree structure. I’ll try to make 
this clear, but if I lose you just skip this and go on to the rest of 
the chapter.

If you use a web search engine (and who does not now), then 
you have used a  branch tree structure. Here is, diagramatically, 
what it looks like (on the next page).



424 Reichian technique, Part Two

Figure 158

Each time four (or five) lines come together we have a “node.” 
Obviously I have drawn only a simplified diagram. There is no 
reason, in theory, why one node cannot give rise to many 
branches, not just three as shown above. The important point, 
however, is that each node in the diagram represents a gestalt 
scene. Each node in the diagram (that is, in the subconscious) 
contains all the elements of a scene; but most importantly it 
contains the physical scene, the thoughts at the time and the 
emotions at the time.98

For illustration, let’s take my memory of riding my bicycle. 
We have the physical scene; we also have my thoughts at the 
time of observing my own competence to ride without holding 

98.For the professionals among my readers, you can recognize this as 
a simplified version of the connectionist and neural net theories of 
mind.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          425
onto the handlebars; we also have my response to that 
observation: pride; and we have my thoughts that I was not under 
the watchful eye of any adult and my response to that thought 
which was joy.

Now a memory like that is easy to recall. But the incidents that 
go into making up our character are often forgotten or not even 
recognized at all. 

Now to this stew, we add the James-Lange theory of emotion 
as modified by cognitive neuroscience (Damasio, 1999, 2003).

In brief, an ‘affect’ is what occurs in the brain, an ‘emotion’ is 
what occurs in the body, a ‘feeling’ is what we have when we 
recognize and evaluate that body state.99

And that is where Reichian comes into the picture. One of the 
things that this therapy does is to make one much more sensitive 
to his body states. That is, it allows one to be much more aware 
of emotions and be able to name them as feelings.

Just one more step and then we can put it all together. Back to 
the branch tree structure of the unconscious. Let’s continue with 
my bicycle node. It has three elements stored in it: scene, 
thoughts, emotions. Each of those three elements gives rise to a 
branch from the node. In turn each branch contacts another node 
which also has at least three elements in it. Then that node gives 
rise to branches which connect to other nodes and so on. If a 
particular node is accessed (by the subconscious) then the next 
node can be from any one of the three branches. In turn that node 
will have at least three elements and any one or more of its 
branches might be followed to another node by the stream of 
subconscious thought.

I know that’s messy; but hopefully it will become clear as I 
continue with an examination of my bicycle memory. I had pride 
as an emotion in my bicycle gestalt. Then at school, I got the 
highest report card in the class and, of course, I felt pride. The 
two gestalts are linked by the common element of the emotion of 

99.There is a medical/psychological condition called alexithymia in 
which there are no feelings or in which they are severely blunted. 
The condition can result from injury to or malformation of the 
prefrontal cortex. It is the prefrontal cortex that evaluates emotion 
to result in feelings.



426 Reichian technique, Part Two

pride. That second gestalt has a branch that contains the school 
setting. That branch leads to another school gestalt but here I was 
proud of my test score until I found out that it was not the highest 
score and then felt shame. The result: I have an experience in the 
present t ime where I  start  to react  with pride;  but my 
subconscious, following the branches, ends up with the bad test 
scene and instead of feeling pride, I feel shame. 

Here is an incident where I would expect to feel pride, yet I 
am feeling shame. The conclusion: emotions are irrational. 
Where one would expect me to feel pride, I feel shame. But are 
they irrational? No, not at all. The subconscious simply followed 
the branches from node to node and ended up where it ended up; 
the whole process is completely logical. I just don’t consciously 
know the connections. All I know is the end result and I am 
mystified by it.

What the technique is doing is making use of all of these 
concepts and theories to work backwards, to go from an emotion 
to a memory.

The technique identifies two (or more) emotions that are 
linked (in the subconscious) and by that means recovers the 
memory where both emotions were present at the same time.

Recovering that memory I now can reevaluate that shame I 
felt and anew judge whether it was appropriate. I can also 
understand why in life I tend to shy away from situations where I 
might be the best and why I regard pride as shameful.

Just to clear my name, all this is simply an example. Any 
relationship to me is a subconscious accident.

That’s nice. If you are good with this technique — or learn to 
be good — you can recover incidents in your life that, over time, 
formed the basis of your character. 

“Ring and the rosey, a pocket full of possey, we all fall down” 
goes the old English nursery rhyme. So you have a pocket full of 
memories, now what do you do with them? I’ll come back to that. 
Just keep reading.

B.    TAKING THE BLAME, DEALING WITH 
INJUSTICE COLLECTING AND PSYCHIC 
MASOCHISM



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          427
This is something that I have tried to teach to every patient I 

have seen for the last 35 years; it is that important.
The statement is simple: whatever happens to you, assume 

first that it is your fault.
There are a number of reasons for this and a number of 

benefits. First, let’s deal with Bergler’s discussion of psychic 
masochism and injustice collecting (page 359). 

Recall that in the quotes from Bergler, it was pointed out that 
this malady is found in nearly everyone and that it is based on 
projection. To collect injustices, you have to start with the 
assumption that you are the innocent victim of someone else’s 
malice. But if you take the blame, there goes the injustice and 
there goes the projection. Assuming that whatever happens to 
you is your fault in one step breaks the pattern of psychic 
masochism100. 

That is one advantage of this technique. A second advantage 
is, once stated, more obvious. It has three parts. First, you can 
change yourself, you can not change the other person. Blaming 
the other person leaves your behavior unexamined and therefore 
unchanged. You have gained nothing by the experience. Second, 
no matter what the other person did, there were things that either 
you did that contributed to it or things that you failed to consider 
that allowed it to happen. Finally, by blaming yourself first, you 
can start to see patterns in your life such that this type of thing 
tends to happen. In other words, by blaming yourself first you get 
a window into your character.

A third advantage is based on our discussion some time ago 
that emotions are a result of cognitive evaluation. Outside of 
evolutionarily inherent fear reactions to physically threatening 
events, all emotions — in this case your emotional reaction to the 
event or the series of events — does not say anything about the 
event; it says something about you. Again outside of inherent fear 
reactions, no emotion is inherent in any situation. Any emotional 
response you have to any event is not a function of the event; it is 

100.But be careful that you do not then start to use the idea of taking 
blame as a new form of masochism (that would involve a coping 
mechanism I am not discussing, the mechanism of secondary 
gain.)



428 Reichian technique, Part Two

a function of your nature in relation to the event. To the extent 
that you hold yourself blameless and the other person guilty, to 
that extent you are treating your emotional response as not of 
your making, not of your (subconscious) choice. To the extent 
that you blame the other person for “what he (or she) did to me,” 
to that extent you are viewing yourself as passive and without 
choice. 

Three good reasons to blame yourself first. Now what do you 
do with that approach? How do you use that technique to get at 
your character?

Before I can address that issue, there are some basic rules of 
self-study and self-restructuring that I need to lay out. 

1.     Gather Data, Don’t Make Changes

The goal is to gather data, not to make changes. The changes 
will come by themselves as you work back to the underlying 
concepts. Without data you will never uncover the underlying 
concepts. Change simply leads to symptom substitution and to 
the exact same character system being presented in a different 
form. Pictorially, if you are looking for the rabbit in one hole, you 
won’t see him escape out another hole.

2.     Behavior Is Over-Determined

Behavior is over-determined. We get the concept of over- 
determined from Freud. It means that a given behavior or set of 
behaviors does not arise from a single source; it or they arise 
from the confluence of several sources. Finding one mistaken 
concept that undergirds your data will not result in change. You 
need to chew the data, always looking for yet another and then 
another concept that feeds into the observed data.

1. gather data, don’t make changes
2. behavior is over determined
3. data needs constant reanalysis to be useful
4 . you are fighting your own character
5. wants become functionally autonomous



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          429

3.     Data Needs Constant Reanalysis To Be Useful

You observe something about yourself. You, properly, ask: 
why am I doing this?; why am I feeling this?; in what way is this 
given behavior characteristic of me?; in what way is this behavior 
unusual for me?; what part of this behavior is ego-syntonic and 
what part ego-dystonic?; what were other possible response and 
why did I either (a) not choose (what prevented me from 
choosing) any of those other possible responses and/or (b) what 
personal catastrophe would I expect to happen if I chose any 
given other response (mainly, why do I expect that other response 
would result in anxiety)?;  what other ways can I label or group 
or view this behavior? 

The most common error in self-study is to observe a behavior 
or an emotion and use a now familiar and timeworn label and 
explanation. That is not self-study, it is rehearsal of pathology. 
We will examine this again when we get to the language of 
emotion, but the principle is general. Keep trying to describe the 
situation using new words. 

At this point, when teaching this to the people I treat, I always 
have to deal with an unasked but implicit question: how will I 
know when I am right, how will I know if I have chosen a right 
word or a wrong word?

There are two answers to that question. The first and most 
important answer is: it doesn’t matter. Just assume you are right 
and examine the situation, behavior, emotion, etc. You won’t 
know whether you are right or wrong and it doesn’t matter. The 
important issue is the investigation, not the answer.

The second answer is that if you hit on a good one your body 
will tell you. When you hit on a new description or a new 
conceptualization that is close to the right one you will get a body 
response. Perhaps a shiver, perhaps a flush (hot or cold), perhaps 
a tightening in the pit of your stomach; you will get some body 
response. 



430 Reichian technique, Part Two

That is one of the beauties of a Reichian approach. It makes the 
body more responsive to affect and it makes one more sensitive 
to their feelings (that is, more sensitive to changes in body 
sensation)101. Speaking for myself, when I happen on a good way 
to think about something (in a different way) I get a shiver up my 
spine; that tells me I am on to something.

4.     You Are Fighting Your Own Character

This is the old “lift yourself up by your bootstraps” problem. 
You are using your own flawed character to study your own 
flawed character. Your own character stands in the way of you 
discovering your character. There is no way out of this 
conundrum. The only thing you can do to fight this circularity 
problem is to try ever new ways to think about an issue. The 
more outlandish your new way is the more likely you are to hit on 
a valuable and right answer.This problem is especially intense 
when it comes to dealing with feelings. The answer is the same, 
but I will hold off a full discussion for a few pages till we get to 
language and emotion in the techniques section.

5.     Wants Become Functionally Autonomous

The principle here is easily stated — and thus easily ignored.

You never want what you want you want the wanting!

Don’t just read the above sentence and pass on; give yourself 
a few minutes to concentrate on it and examine yourself in light 
of the principle. 

Initially a want starts out as just that: something we want. But 
over time, the want itself becomes autonomous (independent) of 
the original stimulus and takes on a life of its own. It become its 
own life-style repetition compulsion (page 411). As adults we 
have character-based things that we seek. But, it turns out, that by 
the time we are able to actively seek to satisfy those wants, they 

101.See footnote 3 on page 15 for the distinction between affect, 
emotion and feeling.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          431
have already become autonomous of their original stimulus and 
we only act “as if”102 we want a result. In fact the want itself has 
become its own motivational element and we now live out the 
wanting as its own dynamic. 

Examine your own wants (marriage, kids, money, fame, 
security, etc.) and you will, hopefully, discover in what way the 
want has become functionally autonomous. Let’s take children as 
a example. Initially you had dreams or phantasies of what it 
would be like to have a child. You envisioned teaching the child 
things, of  family trips, of revisiting Disney Land now as an adult 
such that your children could experience the same joy you 
experienced when you were a child.

Then the child comes and you never have time for family 
trips, teaching the child all the things you have learned becomes 
conflicted instead of the imagined fun, and the trip to Disney 
Land becomes a nightmare of long lines and a bored child. But 
the reality of having a child does not quiet the want. If this child 
is not the one you wanted, the next one will be. The want (for a 
child) has become functionally autonomous and continues with 
its own dynamic. 

Having laid out the rules of self-study, now I can get back to 
the issue of using the technique of blaming yourself first to 
discover your character.

102.This phrase is historically associated with Alfred Adler, who 
took it from a philosopher of the time.



432 Reichian technique, Part Two

6.     Look For Incident Repetition Compulsions

When I get to the discussion of the Adlerian Early Memory 
technique (page 444) I will give you another way to discover 
your incident repetition compulsions. For the present we will 
stick with blaming yourself.

I would start by emphasizing how symbolic the incident 
repetition compulsion becomes. Recall Mark, our baseball 
player. His catching the ball and not getting the praise he sought 
became a formative incident. Let’s look at some of the ways he, 
over time, came to symbolize this incident and thus covertly to 
repeat it.

Obviously, at work he was driven to outstanding performance. 
But somehow the praise of his boss never seemed enough; he 
always left the evaluation with a feeling tone of disappointment. 
That is a fairly straightforward repetition.

He was also a “good friend.” In his own mind that was just 
who he was, and praiseworthy for it. You could count on Mark 
for help when you needed it. But for all the pleasure he seemed 
(to himself) to take in his helpfulness and for all that he regarded 

6. look for incident repetition compulsions
7. look for life style repetition compulsions
8. look for patterns which means gather as much data

as possible and group the data in as many ways as
 you can

9. check your assumptions. All ideas have implicit
assumptions; the major source of character concept
errors lies in these unrecognized implicit
assumptions

10. ask why you are acting or reacting in this way rather
than way (a) or (b) or (c) or (d) or ...

11. apply operations on coping mechanisms
12. when you absolutely can not ring anything more

from the experience, then you can look at the other
person’s contribution to the situation



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          433
that trait in himself as one of his virtues, he also (likely 
unrecognized) always had an undercurrent of resentfulness in 
response to each good friend act. 

He was doing exceptional things and he always got a heartfelt 
“thank you.” for it, but he also quietly and unnoticed also felt 
taken advantage of. Perhaps he was too good a friend and other 
people used him (injustice collection).

He was also a thoughtful husband. He especially liked 
bringing unexpected gifts to his wife. She was always surprised 
and never failed to be effusive in her gratitude. But that did not 
last. There was always another gift to bring and another chance to 
get the praise which his incident repetition demanded.

When he had a son, he could hardly wait to teach him 
baseball. He went to every game if it was at all possible to attend. 
Finally it happened, a catch of a hit ball that no one would have 
expected that his son could catch. At the game, after the game, on 
the way home, Mark could not stop praising the catch and what 
an amazing feat it was. He proudly told his wife about it. He 
proudly told his coworkers about it. If he could have gotten a 
trophy for his son, he would have103. But, then, how to explain 
that a few days later he felt compelled to buy his wife a new pair 
of diamond earnings? 

Incident repetition compulsions are never satisfied. In their 
symbolic form, they fester. Note that it is not the case that simply 
because a behavior is motivated by the mechanism of the incident 
repetition compulsion does not say that it is a bad or non-
functional behavior. One can well find its manifestation to be 
utilitarian or admirable. And, after discovering a repetition 
compulsion you may well decide that you want to retain the 
behavior; the issue is not the cultural or moral worth of the 
behavior, the issue is the motivation behind it. 

Fine enough, but, still, how do you learn to spot these 
repetition compulsions? We start with a principle so fundamental 
to self-study that it deserves to be set off in a comment box for 
emphasis.

103.Technically, this is also an example of the mechanism of 
‘magical thinking.’ 



434 Reichian technique, Part Two

And I do mean: all! You may think saying “good morning” at 
work is just good manners or it is simply what we do each 
morning. But there are people who do not do it. Thus it is 
motivated behavior. Yes, it is good manners; yes, it is a cultural 
custom; but it is also volitional, it manifests a choice on your 
part. It may be so trivial and habitual that you think it is not 
worthy of the effort of study and analysis. Very well, take one 
morning and don’t say it. Now notice the discomfort, the sense of 
being rude, the concern that you are offending and “what will 
people think?”. Even as simple as saying “good morning” is not 
just habit, it is motivated behavior.

But, still, how do you find these hidden highly symbolized 
manifestations of your incident repetition compulsions? As 
always, it starts with data gathering. Just note, and add to your 
mental card catalogue, each incident, big or small. Then, when 
you have a sufficient list, start to corollate them; try to find 
something, anything, that might constitute a common element. 
Don’t look at the details, the minutia, look at the overall picture. 
Treat it as you would if you were a novelist and you were 
working out the character and dialogue of one of your characters. 
In short, take yourself out of the picture and just observe it as 
though it were someone else doing or not doing it. In doing so, 
keep in mind that this process of abstraction looks to the form of 
the behavior, not to the explicit content.

7.     Look For Life-Style Repetition Compulsions

Life-style repetition compulsions are both cruder and more 
pervasive than are incident repetition compulsions. That is, they 
are manifest in more basic choices and patterns. 

All behavior is motivated! Take it as a basic principle of 
life that anything you do or do not do is because it serves 
an intra-psychic purpose. It is motivated.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          435
They also have clearer indicators, clearer sources, than do 

incident repetition compulsions. You spent probably eighteen 
years living with the same parents and siblings. By definition that 
qualifies as a life style104. Now the question is: what was that 
home situation really like? Parents never see their children as 
they are; children never see their parents as they are (were). 

Again, the basic operation is to step back from the details, the 
minutia, and look at the pattern. Let’s say, as an example, that 
your mother followed one of the currently fashionable child 
raising books and gave you “unqualified positive regard.” She 
was unfailingly supportive, unfailingly praising, unfailingly 
taking your side in any disputes (a problem with a friend was 
always that the other person had done you wrong; that you were 
right and had been the victim of the other child’s meanness). 

Just an example, but not an unusual one in my experience.105
What might, given this home life experience, be the result? You 
always expect support. You look for friends who are supportive. 
You tend to avoid conflict. You choose work that is well within 
your competence. When you find someone of the opposite sex 
who seems, in glance or words, to admire you; you are quickly 
smitten. You are a sucker for praise and never seem to be able to 
spot the treachery that might lie beneath the praise. You are 
frequently disappointed by others and “your feeling are easily 
hurt.” You quickly take in new people as good friends and just as 
quickly drop anyone who disappoints you. I could go on; people 
are, as it were, infinitely variable. But the point, I hope, is made. 
When you start to blame yourself first, you then have the basis 
for asking what did I do wrong and why did I do it? Where can I 
find like behavior in other situations and/or with other people? I 
think I know what happened and why; but let’s try out for effect 
completely different ways of looking at the situation. 

104.life-style repetition compulsion: any condition that 
has been experienced for an extended period of time 
comes to be regarded as the natural, the normal, the to 
be expected.

105.I have a special name for this situation. I call it “the white 
hospital syndrome.” The resultant pathology is especially serious 
and especially hard to treat.



436 Reichian technique, Part Two

As I try each new way to conceptualize the whole experience, 
I am looking for patterns, not minutia. I won’t know if I am on 
the right path or off to a dead end; and it does not matter; the 
issue is the exploration not the answer. 

Because behavior is overdetermined, there is not one answer 
to any such inquiry; there are many answers. Some answers 
might be central and others tangential; it does not matter. 
Whatever you can guess at as a new way to conceptualize the 
situation is another path that just might lead to new insight and, 
in any event, it can’t hurt to try it on for size and see where it 
goes.

8.     Look For Patterns

I’ve said this twice now, but here it gets its own heading. A 
single incident can, on occasion, lead back to a memory but the 
usual condition is that the data lies in many seemingly disparate 
and unrelated interchanges or incidents and the crucial analysis 
lies in being able to step back from each incident and see some 
type of pattern. Obviously patterns emerge only  when there is a 
sufficient number of cases that they can be grouped and summed 
in various ways. So finding patterns presupposes analyzing many 
incidents, all in a “it might be” tentative way, and then keeping 
track of the speculative answers until you have enough data to 
start making speculative groupings.

If you are not good at filling out mental filing cards then use 
actual physical filing cards (or put a note on your portable 
device).

Since character is pervasive (as are the two forms of the 
repetition compulsion), you will have occasion to find many data 
points. However, it is also the case that (1) character is not 
unitary, you will find that the data can be grouped in a number of 
different ways and (2) keep in mind that the average person has 
three characters structures all operative at the same time. 

Therefore one rule of study is, as it were, to keep trying new 
and unique ways of conceptualizing the situation and keep all 
possibilities open in your mind. One grouping, when you get to 
that point, might give you data about one character structure 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          437
while another grouping might give you data about another 
character structure. 

Keep in mind also that issue of ego-syntonic and ego-
dystonic. Recall that character is ego-syntonic and thus your “just 
me” way of doing things is not only also data, it is important data. 
Never allow yourself the easy out of saying “that’s just the way I 
am” or “that’s just being responsible” or “that’s simply being 
polite, that’s all” or “that’s simply what is expected of me as a ... 
.” All those are statements of the fact that the behavior is ego-
syntonic and thus are more statements of your character than 
would be other observations.

9.     Check Your Assumptions, Part One.

All human concepts contain hidden assumptions. Often the 
assumptions are so much a part of our thought process that it is 
difficult to ferret out those assumptions. I provided an example of 
that earlier when I wrote about the assumption of cause and effect 
that is part of the adult’s automatic thinking while the child does 
not even have the concept.

Here is where books on logic and philosophy can provide 
valuable insight. In logic I would like to recommend The Art of 
Reasoning (3rd ed.); David Kelly, 1998, New York: W. W. 
Norton and Art of reasoning: readings for logical analysis; 
Stephen Hicks & David Kelley 1998, New York: W. W. Norton. 
In philosophy I happen to like Brand Blanshard’s Reason and 
analysis, 1962/1991, La Salle, IL: Open Court.

There are, of course, innumerable other books on reasoning, 
on logic, and on philosophy. However, it will not help to read a 
given philosopher expounding his theories. The goal of the 
reading is to learn how to think critically, not to learn what 
Heidegger or Nietzsche or Sartre said. 

10.   Check Your Assumptions, Part Two.

In choosing this as a sub-topic I know I am repeating what I 
said above; but the principle bears repetition. 

Emotions (feelings) are not automatic. Why am I experiencing 
this emotion (as opposed to some other emotion)? “Well, 



438 Reichian technique, Part Two

everyone would feel this in this situation” is not an answer, it is 
the avoidance of an answer. That fact is that it is not everyone, it 
is you and there do exist other possibilities, even to feeling 
nothing.

If you can’t seem to lose weight, it is not just that it is hard, or 
that fat runs in your family. The fact is that it is you that is fat and 
all behavior is motivated.

If you enjoy one television show and not another, you have 
data. Something about the plot, the characters, the politics, the 
life style; something about the show that you like fits with your 
character and the show that you do not like challenges your 
character. Ask why. “It’s a funny show” is not an answer, it is the 
avoidance of an answer. 

The same goes for movies you like or dislike, activities you 
enjoy or do not enjoy, people you like or don’t like, magazine 
you read or do not read, news shows that you watch or don’t 
watch, religion that you have or don’t have, clothes that you like 
to wear or don’t like to wear, foods that you like or don’t like, 
music that you like or don’t like. I don’t need to continue with 
this all too easy list. The point is made: everything you do or 
don’t do speaks to who you are; speaks to your character and/or 
your coping mechanisms.

11.   Apply Operations On Coping Mechanisms

Make the assumption you are using the coping mechanisms I 
have highlighted: incident repetition compulsion, life style 
repetition compulsion. projection, introjection, and reaction 
formation. I have already separately discussed the repetition 
compulsions, so lets turn here to the last three.

a.     Projection

Start with the most common: projection. Projection occurs 
when the person takes a thought, emotion, desire or impulse of 
his own and puts it into (projects it onto) someone else.

Every time you have a thought about someone else, stop for a 
moment and ask yourself why you are projecting that thought 
into that other person. The thought or opinion is actually yours 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          439
and you are disowning it by projecting it to someone else. Why? 
What is it you are avoiding, or, alternatively, what is it you are 
trying to accomplish by the projection?

You notice a colleague at work and think: he looks tired. Your 
question: why am I tired today? The answer to that question is 
never: I’m not tired, I feel fine. The only acceptable answer is: I 
am tired today, now why? Start by searching for all possible 
reason why you would feel tired today. Come up with as many 
answers (or reasons) as you possibly can; and then start 
translating the word ‘tired’ into other words. Tired becomes 
bored, or becomes impatient, or becomes uninterested, or 
becomes annoyed, or become preoccupied, etc. You get the idea. 
The easy answer is the wrong answer; that principle follows 
directly from the concept of character and that character is 
pervasive. Your character will immediately supply the ego- 
syntonic answer; you want the ego-dystonic answers. That is 
where the gold lies. Pay attention to any body reactions as an 
additional guide to when you might have hit on a major answer.

b.     Introjection

Introjection as I  am using it  here is the opposite of 
projection.106 In introjection we take something that we believe 
we see in another person and take it into ourself.

The thought: that was a strange look he gave me, I wonder 
what he saw? The answer: he did not give you a strange look, you 
were seeking something from that person and, not getting it, you 
introjected a negative thought about yourself. It is not he who 
gave you a strange look, it is you who gave yourself a strange 
look.

The thought: that meeting was a total waste of time. The 
answer: I am behind in my work and now I’ll never catch up; I 
just wasted an hour in that (silly) meeting. I’ve got to figure out 
some way to budget my time better.

The thought: all Barbara wants to do is gripe about her boy 
friend. The answer: what is it about my relationship with Tim that 

106.Introjection also has a different meaning where it is one of the 
three stages of internalization.



440 Reichian technique, Part Two

is so displeasing to me?; what am I missing?; what do I want that 
I am not getting?

The general process: take any event, idea or conversation and 
treat it as part of you, not part of anyone else. Assume that any 
thought you have is really saying something about yourself. 

c.     Reaction formation

Recall that a reaction formation is to turn something into its 
opposite. The question I posed, to be answered here, is how do 
you discover what the opposite is?

For some ideas or feelings, it is pretty evident; at least at first 
glance. The opposite of strength is weakness, the opposite of 
assured or confident is insecure, the opposite of admire is 
disdain, the opposite of respect is disrespect. But, two things, 
one: those are the easy ones; and two: they are incomplete.

Most opposites are not that obvious. You’ve heard that the 
opposite of love is hate. It is not. The opposite of love is 
disinterest or indifference. The opposite of lonely is the 
contentment or security of not having to deal with anyone. The 
opposite of proud is unsure of the quality or value of your 
claimed accomplishment. The opposite of angry is hurt. Most 
opposites are not obvious.

So how do you find the opposite? You don’t. You make as 
many guesses as you can, use as many even remotely possible 
words and explore each one in turn as though it were correct. If 
you can’t get anywhere with a given possible opposite, you can 
always discard it and pick a new one; if you never give an 
opposite a chance to be explored, you are simply living out the 
ego-syntonic functions of your character and refusing to learn. So 
simply keep trying new words (new concepts, new opposites) and 
see where you can take each of them (after making the working 
assumption for exploration purposes that it is 100% correct).

d.     Combinations

Now we get to the fun part of this exercise, the place where it 
really starts to pay off. Now we put these coping mechanisms 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          441
together and make mud pies. There is no set order, there is only 
experiment and “lets see what happens if ... .”

I fully appreciate that this quickly gets confusing. But it reads 
worse than it lives. I’m going to go over combinations of coping 
mechanisms here; but you can’t master all of this on initial 
application. My recommendation is to start with a single 
mechanism, let’s say: projection, and just use that constantly — 
applicable or not, just apply it anyway — for a week or two. Then 
go to another single mechanism. Depending on how self-
reflective or introspective you are and how observant you are, 
this may take you a month or it might take you six to nine 
months. It makes little difference; it’s a long life and the job of 
living is living. If self-study aids the job of living, like any other 
learning, it is good. If it gets in the way of living, either just drop 
it or put if off till later. 

Another note in the same vein is that life has to be lived 
moment to moment. You can’t function well in life if you are 
constantly spending all your time second guessing why you did 
or did not do something; why you said or did not say something. 
If you just make it a mental habit to note things as they go by — 
just make it a habit to jot down mental notes — then there will be 
time later for reflection and analysis. As long as you are 
gathering the data, then the mental work of disassembling the 
data and looking for patterns and coping mechanisms can be 
done at your leisure. One note here, however, a memory of acts 
that are ego-dystonic is much easier to store than is an act that is 
ego-syntonic. Inexorably, our character blinds us to the important 
ego-syntonic data and yet that is the most important data.

Now to the combinations of coping mechanisms. I’ll start with 
an easy (and common) mix: a reaction formation followed by a 
projection.

You are in a bad mood today. The reaction formation is that 
you are in a good mood. You project that onto a co-worker and 
say: “you look happy today.”

You just received a notice from the IRS that you owe back 
taxes. You can barely pay your bills as it is and now you have 
this hanging over your head. You feel defeated. The reaction 
formation is that you can overcome any obstacle. You project 



442 Reichian technique, Part Two

that onto your child and say: “there is nothing that you can’t 
accomplish.”

You were just told about a promotion at work. You are proud 
and just a bit scared. The reaction formation is that you are sure 
you can handle the new job (opposite of the ‘scared’ part). You 
project that confidence and say to your best fiend at work: “boy, 
you’re really knocking out the work, aren’t you?” 

Now lets try a reaction formation and an introjection. 
You notice that your oldest girl is paying a lot more attention 

to her clothes. The thought is that she is primping for a possible 
boy friend. The reaction formation is that she is not interested in a 
boy, she is only starting to realize that appearance is important in 
the world. You introject that idea and say: “I really need some 
new clothes.” 

You notice a colleague at work looking at you. Your initial 
thought is that there is something wrong with your clothes. The 
reaction formation turns that into your colleague is looking at you 
because you look so good today. You introject that praise, and 
say: “I’ve been loosing weight recently.”

I’ve give you two easy ones, just the use of two mechanisms. 
Now, for practice, let’s go to three mechanisms. The combination 
is (1) projection, (2) reaction formation, and (3) introjection107.

You are concerned about your mounting bills. You project 
that concern into your husband (wife). You then do a reaction 
formation on the projection and the concern about bills becomes 
a confidence that the money situation is going to be fine. You 
then introject that confidence and say: “I wonder if we might 
replace that couch at some point.”

Another example. You have just had a call from your mother 
and, true to form, you are angry (you always feel that after 
talking to her). You project your anger onto your mother. You 
then do a reaction formation and the anger becomes love. You 
then introject that love and think: it’s nice that she calls so often, 
I really must learn to respond to her love with my love.

107.This combination is actually fairly common. It is identical in 
result to the primitive mechanism listed in the table of coping 
mechanisms as projective identification.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          443
So, coping mechanisms are, as it were, all over the place. But 

how do you learn to spot them and how do you go about 
analyzing them in action in yourself?

The first principle is something I have already mentioned. 
You just assume that you are using them all the time and then 
work with several combinations of coping mechanisms to see 
what comes of it. That means: 1) you assume that they are 
present, (2) you assume that you are using any given one to four 
of them at any given time, (3) you treat the assumption as valid 
for the purpose of investigation, (4) you are not concerned (since 
you virtually can’t know) whether you are right or not; it is the 
investigation that is important, not the conclusion.

The next principle is that oft-repeated statement that the job of 
living is living. No one can or should spend all his (her) time 
trying to analyze his (her) every action. That simply gets in the 
way of living. But, by a like token, not constantly doing the 
analysis does not yield the reaction formation of never doing it. 
On your mental file cards, write down just one or two or three 
exchanges per day and take some time away from the TV or the 
computer and chew over those file cards. The more you practice 
this, the more it will become a mode of thought such that you can 
catch yourself in the act of using them. 

The third principle goes back to that body reaction. In general, 
and especially as you get deeper into the body work and get, as I 
promised at the beginning of this book, more emotionally 
sensitive you will have more body reactions to correct guesses 
(assumptions) and this work will get both easier and more 
productive.

I am not done with this section. First I just want to present a 
table of some of the combinations of the more commonly used 
coping (defense) mechanisms and then there is one last 
subsection in this discussion of Blame Yourself First.

Table 1 lists some of the possible combinations. It is not 
exhaustive, but does give you some feel of how you can chew 
over your behavior.

12.   Now Look At The Other Person’s Contribution

To review: the approach of blaming yourself first (1) tends to 
short-circuit psychic masochism and injustice collecting; (2) 
allows you to focus on what you can change (yourself) instead of 
what you can not change (the other person); (3) allows you to 
recognize (as a habit of mind) that you are the source of your 
emotional reactions, you are not the passive object of events that 
is ‘made to’ feel anything; (4) allows you to learn to apply coping 
mechanism thinking to your own behavior; and (5) once you 
have fully examined how and why you caused the incident — 
and that most definitely includes looking at why you did not see 
the potential for the incident to occur — why you were blinded to 
the nature of the other person(s) involved — then you can always 
look at what the other person did or did not do that caused the 
incident.

Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          445
When Freud returned from his adulatory time with Janet in 

France, he was convinced that the cause of all mental illness is 
childhood forgetting108. The technical term is childhood 
anamnesis and the ‘reason why’ that Freud settled on was 
repression rather than the term “dissociation” that was used by 
Janet.109

So children repressed ideas and memories that did result or 
might result in unpleasant affect (that is, in the final analysis, 
feelings). In a characteristic form (for Freud) of circular 
reasoning, the fact that we don’t recall much from our childhood 
was because of repression and the proof that repression existed is 
that we don’t recall much from our childhood.

Alfred Adler took the opposite side of that situation. If we 
don’t recall much from our childhood; still there are for each of 
us some memories from our childhood that stand out. Why is it, 
Adler asked, if we forget most of our childhood that we do 
remember some of it and usually in particular detail?

Freud wanted, through psychoanalysis, to recover these 
repressed memories and Adler wanted, through individual 
psychology110, to understand why we remember specific scenes 
from our childhood.

If we forget most of it, there must be something about the 
remembered memories that make them especially important. 
These stand-out memories, Adler wrote, give rise to what he 
termed “the style of life.” Now, even before proceeding, it is 
important to understand that it does not make any difference if 
these memories are veridical or whether they are, in Freud’s 
term, screen memories.That is, it does not make any difference 
whether the memory is of something that actually happened or 

108.Freud was so taken by Janet’s hypnotic recall method that he 
translated Janet’s works into German. Freud started his 
psychotherapy practice by using hypnosis as he had seen in use by 
Janet. 

109.Whether dissociation and repression are just two different words 
for the same thing or whether they are different mechanisms is a 
subject of continuing debate in the psychology literature.

110.Individual psychology was the name Adler gave to his approach 
to therapy.



446 Reichian technique, Part Two

whether the memory is an invention of the subconscious which, 
of course, the person thinks most definitely did happen111. 

If, as Freud maintained, we repress because an idea or 
memory would result in unpleasant affect; then, by like 
reasoning, we remember because the memory results in pleasant 
affect. Now before you dismiss this because you have early 
stand-out memories that were anything but pleasant; recall the 
issue of the incident repetition compulsion. The memory, for 
Adler, is pleasant in that it explains and justifies our character 
(our style of life in Adler’s terms). 

I’ll give you one from my store of Adlerian early memories. I 
am with my parents and sister at a winter resort outside of 
Chicago where I grew up. It is getting late in the day and I am 
playing with the other children in building a snow man. My 
father comes over and says it is getting late and we have to go 
home. I don’t want to, I want to continue building the snow man. 
My father grabs my wrist and drags me off to the car.

That is the clear memory. But what does it mean? Why that 
memory? It took me several years of periodically returning to 
that memory to figure out its meaning, its relation to my style of 
life. 

In being dragged off, I was (1) helpless before superior 
strength and (2) my sense of justice was violated. Looking at 
myself as an adult I recognized that I had never in my life 
engaged in any physical violence (I had never used my superior 
physical strength to impose my will on anyone) and I had an 
exaggerated, perhaps overdeveloped, sense of justice. I had a 
profound distaste for our gladiator system of courts and my 
politics was libertarian, a political philosophy that eschewed as a 
basic moral principle the imposition of state authority on anyone 
who was not himself employing physical violence. Thus this 
early memory served to explain and/or predicate my style of 

111.This phenomena does not relate to the “recovered memory 
syndrome.” Recent study of recovered memories  –  memories that 
were ostensibly repressed and then recovered, often under 
hypnosis  –  shows that the recall is, at best, dubious. Research on 
memory shows that it is seldom veridical (true to fact). For further 
study see: Loftus and Ketcham, 1994; Ofshe & Watters, 1996; 
Baker, 1998; Pendergrast, 1996; Crews, 2006.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          447
interpersonal relationships and my sense of justice/injustice and 
my politics112.

As a therapist, I routinely employ the Adlerian Early Memory 
Technique. Early in my work with someone, often in the first 
session, I solicit my patient’s early memories. I ask for the 
following: (1) describe the scene — it may be just like a still 
photograph or it may be just like a few moments of film, (2) what 
approximate age where you, (3) what were your thoughts at the 
time, (4) what were your emotions at the time, and (5) what has 
this memory meant to you since (that is, what meaning do you 
attach to the memory in terms of your life)?

The beauty of the early memory technique is that it is a quick 
way into the person’s character. It is often the case that it is 
difficult to sort out the relevant issue in the memory; but the 
issue(s) is (are) there; the memory is important else it would not 
be remembered, it is only an issue of seeing all the implications 
of that memory. 

In your self-study, I urge you to use this technique on 
yourself113. Actually write out your 1/2 dozen or so early 
memories. Record the five elements: (1) scene, (2) age, (3) 
thoughts at the time, (4) emotions at the time, (5) meaning since. 

Once you have those memories down on paper, then start to 
explore each one. 

You may take it as a given, an axiom even, that there is 
profound meaning in the memory and it but needs honest study 
and analysis to see its derivatives manifest in your life. Further in 
using this technique, don’t ignore the operation of defense 
mechanisms. True, these memories are hallmark incident 
repetition compulsions but that does not mean that you have not, 
for example, employed reaction formations and projections on 

112.Actually, there is much more in this memory that corresponds to 
who I am as a person, but this is not an autobiography and what I 
have provided demonstrates the concept.

113.One warning: don’t search for memories. Take only the ones 
well known to you without you having to search for them. If you 
undertake a deliberate process of trying to recall early incidents, 
what you will get is defensive memories of the subconscious 
designed to lead you in the wrong direction.



448 Reichian technique, Part Two

elements of the memory. Just keep probing and analyzing; it will 
be worth your time and effort.

To complete the exploration of this technique, also keep in 
mind that as you do the Reichian work, new early memories will 
emerge. These new memories are not less important, they are 
more important. They will give you a window into deeper and 
more covert aspects of your character.

D.    EXPLORING YOUR DEFINITION OF EMOTIVE 
(FEELING) TERMS

On pages 396-400 I discussed the problem of having a limited 
emotional vocabulary or of having emotive words which are mis-
defined. I also mentioned (page 310) that emotions are rarely 
singular, there are, as a rough guide, six emotions all going at the 
same time. 

I mentioned in discussing defense (coping) mechanisms, that 
it is not the answer which is important, it is the investigation. 
This same principle applies here. If you have a poverty of 
emotive words (nowhere near that over 550 emotive words in the 
English language) or you have an unknown mis-definition of an 
emotive term, it is unlikely that you can easily correct either 
limitation. What you can do is take any suspected feeling and, 
after exploring yourself in the context of that suspected feeling 
(and using the techniques presented here to find other same-time 
present feelings) you can then use a different word to describe or 
name the feeling and then start the exploration with that new 
word. 

As always, you make the assumption for exploration purposes 
that any word you apply is the correct word. When you have 
gotten all you can from that first word substitution, try another 
one and yet another one. 

Here is a simple example. You note a sensation in or near the 
stomach. At first it seems to you to be disgust. All right, you feel 
disgusted. Now, why?, what does it say about you that you would 
respond to the given situation with disgust?, is it a familiar 
feeling or an unusual one?, do you approve, disapprove, or are 
you neutral about that feeling in this situation?, what is the 
strength of the feeling?, is it growing, disappearing, staying with 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          449
you?, can you logically validate that feeling (i.e. it is reasonable 
that given the situation that one would feel disgust)?, what is the 
intensity of the feeling and is  that  intens ity logically 
appropriate114?, what memories, especially early childhood 
memories, can you associate to that same feeling? 

Now change. It is not disgust, it is revulsion. Go through the 
above sequence all over again now with the assumption that your 
are feeling revulsion.

Change again. It is not disgust, it is anguish. It is not disgust, it 
is anxiety. It is not disgust, it is defeat. It is not disgust, it is 
futility. It is not disgust, it is longing. You get the idea. 

Reichian will result in your being sensitive to body sensations 
and thus better able both to note that they are present and to label 
them as particular feelings. However, we have discussed that the 
character is everywhere and that includes the creation of 
emotions which are ego-syntonic to the character. So what you 
think you are feeling might be a manifestation of a defensive 
operation and your job is to not let your subconscious get away 
with the deception.

E.    THE ACTION APPROACH

This section heading is the title of a book by George Weinberg 
(1969). In this book, Weinberg makes an interesting and 
important point. If you are going to change something about 
yourself you can do it only if you experiment with the new 
behavior. In short, change requires practice with the change.

I am fond of quoting a passage from a translation of Spinoza’s 
On The Improvement of the Understanding115. It is: “I was 
unwilling at first to give up a good, bad by reason of its nature 

114.In addressing the issue of logically appropriate intensity, don’t 
consider yourself; consider the hypothetical person and ask 
whether most anyone would feel that emotion and with that 
intensity.

115.Sorry, I can’t give you the exact translation. The translation of 
Spinoza’s On the Improvement of the Understanding that I have 
now in my library translates this passage in a way which to me is 
very clumsy and lacks the lucidity of the passage as I quote it here.



450 Reichian technique, Part Two

but certain of its attainment for a good, good by reason of its 
nature but uncertain of its attainment.” While Spinoza was 
talking here of God, the principle is a general one. What you have 
now in the form of your character is bad (bad in the sense that it 
is not working as you want it to else why would you be trying to 
change it) but at least you have it, it is certain; but what you are 
trying to achieve is a different character which will work better 
(or at least one hopes it will) but it is not clear that you will be 
able to achieve that new character.

What Reichian mainly does is remove the persistence of your 
present character; but it does not supply you with a new 
character. As the impediments to change are lifted by the therapy, 
you will develop and become comfortable with a new way of 
“being-in-the-world116” in part only by experimenting with the 
potential changes.

Are you, in your view, too passive? You are not going to 
become assertive unless you experiment with being assertive. 
You have to learn, by experience, what being assertive feels like, 
what ways of being assertive work in the world and which lead to 
trouble, and how being assertive is going to mesh or conflict with 
other aspects of your character.

Exactly the same line of thinking would apply to being too 
assertive at present. You are going to learn by experimentation 
what it is like to not be assertive.

This same principle applies all across the board. Since the 
main enemy of life is the superego, violating the superego or the 
ego ideal will be uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking. You can 
become accustomed to these new behaviors only by trying them 
on for size and seeing if they fit.

Consider the things that, in the past and habitually, you either 
did all the time or never did. How about bowling? Perhaps in 
high school you found that you did not enjoy bowling. Fine, try it 
again now; you might just like it now. How about ping pong or 
tennis or checkers or cross word puzzles? I gave some examples 
of things you might not do and how it won’t hurt to try them; but 
it applies also on the other side. Do you usually see the latest 

116.The phrase is from the philosopher, Martin Heidegger in Being 
and Time. 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          451
movies? Then try not seeing any movie, even on TV, for six 
months. Are you very social? Perhaps a weekend rarely passes 
without you attending at least one and often two social 
function(s). Fine, try turning down all social engagements for six 
months and see what happens. 

The issue is: to change, take action, try it out. It can’t hurt and 
you might discover that you are not the person you used to be and 
assumed you still were.

F.    GUILT, VALID AND INVALID

No single emotion, not even anxiety, has a more pervasive 
deleterious effect than does guilt (and its cogeners: shame, 
embarrassment and self-disgust). Thus I have chosen to add a 
short discussion of the concept of guilt.

Human beings are suckers for guilt. It is built into us by 
evolution and parents. Guilt is corrosive and non-productive. It 
only stands in the way of life. Body-based psychotherapy will do 
nothing, by itself, to remove guilt. However, because guilt is so 
corrosive an emotion, it is very important that you do the 
cognitive work to remove guilt from your self-image.117

Because humans are suckers for guilt, religion grabbed hold of 
the emotion to use it for its value in contributing to the power of 
the church (Becker, 1968). They did this by the simple expedient 
of inverting the concept of guilt. The church put guilt as an after-
the-fact concept. Properly, it is a before-the-fact concept.

The church treated guilt as something that you are (that is, 
guilty) by reason of you having done something118. That is, you 
did something and therefore now you are guilty. The church 
treated guilt as something that arises after the act. Once you 

117.There is empirical evidence that shame is different from guilt and 
(1) shame is strongly associated with depression, (2) both are 
differentially linked to the genetic variable of what is called “field-
dependence” and “field-independence.” For a discussion see 
Lewis, 1990.

118.The Christian Church, following Jewish tradition, made guilt a 
condition of existence. By reason of being born, you are therefore 
guilty. The only way out of this guilt is to acknowledge the power 
of the church to remove the inherent guilt.



452 Reichian technique, Part Two

admit or acknowledge guilt, then you are in the power of the 
church which put itself forward as the only organization which 
can remove or remit the guilt. 

Properly applied, guilt is a before-the-fact concept. One uses 
the concept (and emotion) of guilt as a way to make decisions. 
The simple questions is: if I do this thing am I likely to feel guilty 
afterwards? 

However, put this way -- as a before-the-act concept -- invites 
another problem. It invites giving power to the worst part of you, 
to the superego and to the ego ideal. I don’t intend that in any 
way. 

The concept of guilt, as I will discuss next, implies not a rigid 
superego (you may not) or a rigid ego ideal (you must), rather it 
implies a coherent moral system. For most people a moral system 
is what has been drilled into them by their parents or by their 
culture. To challenge one’s moral system, I teach my patients to 
ask two questions (on an ongoing basis): (1) how do I know (that 
this is wrong or that this is true) and (2) who said so (from where 
did I get that idea that this act or attitude or conviction is wrong 
and can I, by my own logic, validate it)?

Treating guilt this way, as a before the fact issue, the church 
(and parents) loose(s) much of its (their) power. Here is how it 
works.

First, we distinguish two types of guilt: (1) guilt as a guide to 
action, and (2) actual guilt. Our objective in this work is to 
potentiate guilt as a guide to action and diminish actual guilt to 
the point of unimportance. 

Actual guilt does exist, but only if there were four things 
present when you did something about which you feel guilty:

1. you had knowledge at the time that there was a 
moral issue involved

2. you had a moral code that dealt with the issue
3. you had actual near-equal-cost alternatives and 

you were cognitively aware of those alternatives.
4. In the light of your moral code, your knowledge, 

and your recognition of realistic alternative courses of action, you 
choose to deliberately violate your own moral code.

Before examining each of those four issues, keep in mind that 
we are here addressing past actions about which you have some 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          453
guilt. Guilt is a non-productive emotion. Guilt eats at your self-
esteem as the quotes from Bergler and Horney make clear. The 
goal is to diminish or, hopefully, eliminate guilt for past actions 
as a part of your psychological makeup.

Considering each of the four issues:

1.     Knowledge Of A Moral Issue

Guilt most frequently arises in retrospect. Looking back at 
something we did or failed to do, we feel guilt.  But at the time of 
the action or inaction, there was no thought of there being a moral 
issue involved. Retrospective guilt is never valid. Note here that I 
am not talking about the legal concept of guilt; I am addressing 
only the personal (and emotional) issue of guilt.

In order for one to have or be in a condition where guilt is an 
appropriate concept (and thus an appropriate emotion) there has 
to have been a moral issue involved in the action or inaction and, 
further, you had to have knowledge at that time that there was a 
moral issue involved. To say again, most guilt arises in 
retrospect. We look backward at something we did or did not do 
and applying today’s moral code -- a moral code that was 
different or not present at the time -- we judge ourselves guilty.

2.     The Presence Of A Moral Code

Next, you had to have had a moral code at the time that, to a 
grater or lesser degree, dealt with the situation. Many people — 
for all I know most people — have only the glimmerings of an 
extensive or coherent moral code. On the contrary, most people 
seem to have only a loose aggregate of moral (normative) 
statements that they use as a substitute for a coherent moral code:

You should be kind to others.
Why?
Well, you should, that’s all. It’s the right way to be.
Prove that to me.
I can’t. It’s just right, that’s all.

Most guilt over past actions arises out of situations for which 
the person had no moral code as such at the time. Thus they look 
at the end result, judge the end result to be bad, and then say to 



454 Reichian technique, Part Two

themselves things like “I knew better” or “I knew I was being 
stupid” or “I knew I was doing something I shouldn’t do.” There 
are a host of cognitive errors in that type of thinking but we are 
looking here at only one: the presence (then, not now) of a moral 
code.

A bad result is not an indication of a moral lapse. Knowledge 
that one should not have done something or that one was acting 
stupidly does not substitute for an issue of morality. To live is to 
make mistakes. To live is to get bad outcomes of some actions or 
inactions. Most guilt for past bad outcomes amounts to: “if only 
... .” An example may help.

You were driving badly and wrecked your father’s car.
You knew you were supposed to be careful and instead you 

were talking with your friends while you were driving and not 
watching the road.

Because of your accident your father was without a car for a 
month (he had to take the bus to work) and the insurance 
premiums were increased to the point where it was difficult to 
afford them.

“If only” you had done what you were supposed to do and 
paid attention to your driving, it never would have happened. All 
correct. I you had not been inattentive to the road, then you likely 
would not have had the accident. But where is the guilt?

As a teenager your values placed friends above careful 
driving. In your talking you were not violating your value 
system, you were following it. Your values there resulted in a bad 
outcome and that constitutes an error; it does not constitute a 
basis for guilt. Guilt, properly considered, is a moral issue and 
you were not driving immorally.

3.     Knowledge Of Realistic Alternatives Of Action

At the time of the action or inaction you had to have 
knowledge of realistic alternatives available to you. By ‘realistic 
alternatives’ I mean that the alternative(s) is (are) in fact (not in 
theory) capable of being done and that the personal or monetary 
cost of the alternative(s) was (were) roughly comparable. 

Suppose I know that Bobby stole a car. My moral code 
indicates that I should report that knowledge to the police. I also 



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          455
believe — based on what knowledge is available to me — that if 
I report Bobby that he or his buddies will physically retaliate and 
probably seriously hurt me. Thus to report or not to report are not 
equal cost alternatives. The cost of reporting is too high. 

The proper concept of guilt requires that there be both 
reasonable alternatives and that you have (or had) knowledge of 
those alternatives. Guilt is not a function of outcome; it is a 
function of possibilities and knowledge of them.

4.     Deliberate Violation Of Your Own Moral Code

The final step is that in light of your moral code, your 
knowledge that your moral code is (was) involved in the decision 
to act or not act, and your knowledge of the likely cost of each 
alternative; you deliberately choose or chose to violate your own 
moral code.

Thus actual (also called, authentic) guilt requires this choice to 
violate your own personal moral code when you could have done 
elsewise and know (or knew) you could have done elsewise.

Please note here that it is your own personal moral code that is 
involved; not society’s or other people’s supposed moral code. 
For that reason the proper (psychologically proper) value of the 
emotion of guilt is that it guides you, before the fact, in making 
correct decisions. Is there a moral issue involved? Do I have a 
moral code that covers this type of situation? What alternative 
courses of action do I think are open to me? Given the issue, the 
code, and the choices; I will do X and not Y because Y would 
lead to authentic guilt and I recognize that guilt is anti-life, it is 
corrosive to my being-in-the-world.

5.     Overcoming Guilt

The major error that all too many people make is to apply 
today’s moral code to an action that occurred years ago (when the 
personal moral code was different). That guilt serves no real- 
world purpose. To combat guilt, re-examine what you did in the 
context of the time at which you did it. Reconstitute, as best you 
can, your moral code at that time, your consideration of your 
moral code at that time, whether you were or were not aware of 



456 Reichian technique, Part Two

viable alternatives at that time, and whether you willfully in full 
light of your knowledge then made a choice which violated the 
moral code you had at that time.

Let’s suppose that all the conditions are met. You have actual 
guilt. What do you do about it? Nothing! The issue is past, it can 
not be changed and any guilt you revel in is only a form of 
psychic masochism. In the older psychological literature it used 
to be called moral masochism. Guilt is a non-productive emotion. 
It leads nowhere. It is only destructive. If correction of the issue 
involves a simple apology, that is a no-cost option. Do it. Other 
than that simply recognize that you did something which violated 
your own moral code and resolve in the future to give more 
weight to your moral code and to making decisions in light of 
that moral code.

G.    DOING THE COGNITIVE WORK

We have come to the payoff of all this watching, gathering 
data and collecting the data in various ways to indicate the 
presence of character traits that it would benefit you to change.

The method is called “psychological integration” and it 
consists of four steps. After I present the four steps I will explain 
why it works and, empirically, what I have observed in its use by 
myself and others.

1.     Step 1: What Am I Doing

This issue arises naturally from the data gathering you, 
hopefully, have been doing. With enough data observed, 
recorded on your mental filing cards, and then grouped in various 
ways to indicate the presence of character traits and/or the use of 
defense mechanisms; you can now observe behavior which was 
previously ego-syntonic and recognize it not just as “who I am” 
but rather as the operation of your character and/or defense 
mechanisms.

So this first step involves simply being aware of what you are 
doing. Fine, except here is where the first major misuse of the 
technique arises.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          457
The tendency is to continually label the same (or like) action 

with the same word or description. An example: I am getting 
angry over nothing. That might be true as far as it goes, but it 
does  not  go  far  enough and wi l l  sabotage  the  whole  
psychological integration process if you treat it that way.

Instead of treating it always as the same thing; try each time to 
treat it as something different. It is not “I am getting angry over 
nothing,” it is “I am feeling unappreciated;” “I am feeling 
unimportant;” “I am feeling like I am a child whose opinions are 
ignored;” “I am feeling like I am a jackass;” etc. The idea is to try 
each time to phrase the situation in a different way.

2.     Step 2: Why Am I Doing It

Taking each of the restatements of the situation, ask yourself 
what is it about my psychology that results in this feeling or in 
this action. 

Again this is where misuse arises. Recall the principle that I 
put into a special note box: all behavior is motivated. Also 
recall the concept of “over-determined.” There is not one reason 
why you do something, there are several reasons. The “what am I 
doing” question is an issue of self-exploration. There has to be 
some reason, in fact several reasons, why I am doing this; now 
what might some of those reasons be.

Again, I point out that finding the right answer is not the issue. 
Your body might give you a signal when you come on the right 
one or one close to right; but don’t count on that. It is NOT the 
case that simply because you do not get a body reaction that you 
are then on a wrong path.

The issue is the honesty, integrity, and thoroughness of your 
investigation that is the most important issue.

One thing that you DO NOT want to do, is come up with the 
same answer you came up with before. That type of thinking does 
not correct character pathology, it only rehearses it. 

Asking “why am I doing it” is where you speculatively try 
answer after answer, each time gathering new information. Let 
me hark back to the branch tree discussion (page 424). A good 
way to look at this is that each time you are trying to go down a 



458 Reichian technique, Part Two

different path of nodes and connections to discover new elements 
of yourself.

When you find one of the many things about yourself that you 
think is the most dysfunctional in your life, put the rest on hold 
for the present and focus on just that one behavior.

3.     Step 3: What Is Valid

Don’t jump to step three. It will always be there. First get as 
much data about yourself as you possibly can. Recall that change 
without exploration of underlying cognitive errors only leads to 
symptom substitution.

What is valid follows from steps one and two. I am doing ZZZ 
and the reasons why are AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD. Now, the 
question is, stepping outside my AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD; 
what is the logically valid or socially approved way to act? This, 
in effect, returns us to the discussion of the action approach (page 
449) and the observation that to make changes in oneself, one has 
to experiment with new behaviors. 

So here you say, Well I am doing ZZZ but logically, when I 
think it through on its own merits (without my AAA, BBB, CCC, 
and DDD errors) likely the right thing to do would be HHH.

4.     Step 4: Do It

This is the easy one, now do HHH.
Oops, well maybe not the easy one. This violation of your 

own character will possibly produce anxiety or frustration or 
even shame or guilt. No problem. That is simply more data. 

Let’s see. I did HHH and afterward I felt really awkward and 
out of place. Why? What is it in my psychology that resulted in 
my reacting with that feeling119?

The body work lets you get to this degree of emotional 
sensitivity and ability to undertake an honest exploration of 
yourself, but ability is only a prerequisite; it is not the doing. That 

119.Just a minor reminder. Emotions are not singular. There are 
usually about six emotions present at any one moment.



Chapter 23, Doing the cognitive work          459
is up to you and whether you really care about clearing out the 
cobwebs of youth.

5.     Why It Works

What this technique is doing is cognitively reprogramming 
you own unconscious. By your exploration you are forcing your 
unconscious to traverse not one familiar set of nodes and paths, 
but a whole set of them and at the end of each pathway you are 
adding new data to the redintegration (the gestalt). 

The technique is powerful, it works, but it is slow and arduous 
work and depends totally on the integrity with which you 
undertake it.

6.     Observations on Psychological Integration

There is a strange outcome to this process. I have no 
explanation as to why this happens; it is just observation, absent 
theory.

When you are working on one particular behavior, you will 
find that it takes about six weeks to change it. The change will 
occur organically. That is, you have been doing it way ZZZ and 
working on it when suddenly you find, looking back, that the last 
time you did not do ZZZ you did HHH. It was not that you were 
imposing HHH on yourself, it was just automatically the way you 
reacted. 

But, for unknown reasons, the old ZZZ will return about four 
weeks later. You will be aware of the regression, you will notice 
almost immediately that you have fallen back into an old pattern.

No problem. Simply start again watching for ZZZ, tracing it 
back to “why did I do it” (thus traversing ever new nodes and 
paths) and after a few eruptions ZZZ will disappear and HHH 
will be there in its place.

But, you are not through yet. About four months later (I have 
no explanation for the four weeks or the four months), ZZZ will 
pop up again. Do a little of ‘what am I doing’ and ‘why am I 
doing it’; and it will disappear rapidly, to be replaced by HHH. 

I suppose the old ZZZ could still return. I have never seen it 
happen, but it could. But, then, you know what to do with it.

H.    TABLE OF COPING MECHANISMS

Because of the emphasis placed on coping mechanisms in this 
book, the following is supplied for those readers not familiar with 
the range of these mechanisms.  The material is drawn from a 
host of sources.  Reasonably, not all authors agree on the age of 
appearance of any given coping mechanism or on its exact mode 
of operation.  This compilation is intended to provide a quick 
guide and can not replace serious literature study.  These tables 
were  prepared by the  au thor  and  are  used by h im in  
understanding his patients.  The tables draw on both object 
relations theory and on Freud.

Since the table of coping mechanisms uses Freudian terms like 
oral-aggressive and oedipal, it has to start with another short table 
that assigns ages to each of these stages120. In the table that 
follows here, before the table of the coping mechanisms, I list 
both the traditional Freudian assigned ages and the ages that I 
prefer and use.

120.We have known for nearly 50 years from the work of Harlow 
with surrogate mothers with monkeys (subsequently verified from 
another perspective by Bowlby (1969, 1973, 1980)) that Freud’s 
postulation (in conformity to many other thinkers of the time) of 
an oral stage is wrong. Also we have been unable to verify Freud’s 
anal stage and it, too, is likely wrong. The concept of an Oedipal/
Electra conflict is likely correct (Brown, 1991).
