Foreword

Bernard Stiegler

Translated by Daniel Ross

This book by Yuk Hui is an exceptional work in many ways, fore-most thanks to the scope of the author’s questions and the resources 
he manages to incorporate into his thinking, which he does with unusual 
rigor and an invaluable openness of mind and spirit. Ouverture d’esprit 
should in this case be taken literally: Yuk Hui practices this openness that 
is the life of the mind, and he does so methodically, via notions of relations 
of scale and orders of magnitude. He convokes analytical and continental 
philosophy, cognitivism and phenomenology, and computational theory 
alongside the human and social sciences, showing that the relations and 
nonrelations between them are to a large extent the result of unconceptu-
alized questions of scale. His is a most generous form of thinking: situat-
ing philosophies and theorems on scales that relate them in terms of order 
of magnitude allows room for hospitality toward all manner of rigorous 
and original thinking.

One might be tempted to see in such a project of rationally ordering 
the archipelago of contemporary knowledge an outdated desire for sys-
tematicity. One would be wrong. The system may indeed be a question 
for Yuk Hui, but his thinking of orders of magnitude, ordered in terms of 
their relations, goes far beyond this: it becomes instead a question of mi-
lieux. The sciences and technologies of automation and automatism— in 
their movement from Ludwig von Bertalanffy to big data and passing 
through cybernetics, information theory, and open systems theory, and 
by reactivating and transforming the questions of thermodynamics and 
biology— do indeed, in the broadest sense, lead back to and renew sys-
temic questions. And to the extent that such systems form the production 



viii FOREWORD

apparatus of globalized capitalism, they do lead to an expansion of the ques-
tions opened by Marx in the Grundrisse, in his “Fragment on Machines.” 
Hence it is also from within this economico- political horizon that we 
must read the present work.

But with the concept of the digital object, Yuk Hui shows that, in the dy-
namic systems that continuously reconfigure the artifacts emerging from 
industrial innovation, new relativities of scale form and deform, and from 
this arise improbabilities that are always in dynamic excess over and above 
the systems whence they derive. In this context, the system must be under-
stood not just as a system but above all as a preindividual milieu. From out 
of the preindividual, there forms what Gilbert Simondon called an associ-
ated milieu (a term with more than one meaning). Hence Yuk Hui passes 
through Simondon. But he also revisits Heidegger and stages a reciprocal 
confrontation between them— and we should not forget that Heidegger 
was himself a reader of Jakob von Uexküll, for whom the question of milieu 
became that of the Umwelt, which then contributed to the formation of the 
concept of world in the existential analytic of Sein und Zeit.

Understanding contemporary automated systems on the basis of the 
concept of the digital object, then, means redefining them in a way that 
passes through the concepts of preindividual milieu, individuation, world, 
being- in- the- world, Zuhandenheit and its associated milieu— which may 
in addition provide new resources with which to interpret the notions of 
Gestell and Ereignis, through which Heidegger explored the cybernetic 
age. In this light, the analysis of the system that Heidegger conducts in 
his course on Schelling perhaps merits reinterpretation.1 The twentieth 
century would then have been that of systems theory in a sense entirely 
different from what the philosophies of modernity have generated out of 
the “system of idealism” that crystallized around Kant. If, as Heidegger 
argued, the concept of system is for Schelling inseparable from the ques-
tion of the freedom of spirit (and of spirit as openness), then conversely, 
the question of the system, which arises in a new way in the Gestell of the 
cybernetic age, must be redefined with Simondon in terms of a realism of 
relations and an analysis of processes of individuation that are woven as 
relations of scale and orders of magnitude: such are the conjectures with 
which On the Existence of Digital Objects may inspire us.

The industrial milieu— which is here the stake— first began to emerge dur-
ing that epoch that saw the young Hegel, Hölderlin, and Schelling all de-
bating Kantian idealism. The scientific concepts that arose at that time 



 FOREWORD ix

(including those of thermodynamics) then become central to the various 
systems theories formulated in the course of the twentieth century. Yet 
this still completely escaped these three precocious thinkers of the end of 
the nineteenth century, and this is so in particular because these scientific 
concepts (forming the “new rationality” that we find ourselves groping for 
in the “new alliance” that Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers try to think) 
all pass, right up until our time, through the confrontation with their tech-
nological concretizations— from the steam engine to nanotechnologies 
and via network computing, the latter being that in which, since 1993, the 
digital object has been formed.

The system, then, begins to become a reticulated milieu, or what 
Simondon began to think in terms of a technogeographical milieu2 and 
in terms of a mode of existence in the sense of a type of existence. On the 
Existence of Digital Objects investigates of what this specific new type of ob-
ject consists. As systems turn into reticulated milieus, these technological 
concretizations of systemic becoming give rise to functional challenges— 
including in the form of functional stupidity.3 If On the Existence of Digital 
Objects does not aim to produce a “system,” its concepts are nevertheless 
derived from various forms of systemic thinking, but also from those auto-
mated systems that produce computational concretions.

Among these concepts, recursive function is central: recursion is what 
is implemented by computerized systems of exploitation through algo-
rithms and computational functions— Yuk Hui is first a practitioner and 
theorist of computer science and the study of artificial intelligence (AI).4 
Furthermore, recursion as characteristic of the digital object lies at the heart 
of the concept toward which this book leads us through investigation of 
this object, namely, “tertiary protention.” By passing through Husserl, Yuk 
Hui utilizes this concept of tertiary protention to attempt to rethink time, 
today, as a “new synthesis,” after that realism of relations that Simondon 
himself understood as an attempt to think time.

The digital object is utterly relational. As such, it constitutes, together 
with the sociotechnical artifacts that are its conditions of possibility (such 
as the norms and standards of markup languages such as GML, SGML, 
HTML, or XML), a digital milieu, which cannot be properly understood 
in terms of what Luciano Floridi calls the inforsphere. Beyond the latter, 
and as we have already seen, we must pass through the concepts of asso-
ciated milieu, preindividual milieu, Zuhandenheit, and Vorhandenheit, but 
in so doing, these concepts must themselves be redefined. This theory of the 
digital object aims at a new “first philosophy.” This is the general context, 



x FOREWORD

in terms of the fundamental references from the side of European philoso-
phy, with which Yuk Hui confronts the questions, problematics, and proj-
ects of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the semantic web as 
thought and promoted by Tim Berners- Lee; of formal ontologies in Barry 
Smith’s sense; of “extended mind” in Andy Clark’s sense, and so on.

Returning to the methodological stakes of the work, its immediate con-
ceptual consequences and its ambition mean that it necessarily involves 
and aims at the very long term. The realization that Simondon’s realism 
of relations turned technical schemas into transductive operators of com-
munication between orders of magnitude makes clear the importance, the 
audacity, and, ultimately, the enormity of such an approach— and I use 
the word enormity in the sense cultivated by Rimbaud in and through his 
thought of “voyance.”5

On the basis of the immense challenges that orders of magnitude consti-
tute in this realism of relations— spelled out clearly by Vincent Bontemps 
in his analysis of Simondon’s course on technics6— Yuk Hui tries to liter-
ally refound the question of time by questioning Heidegger and, beyond 
that, questioning Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason in relation to the 
schematism, and by introducing his own fundamental concept of tertiary 
protention. Before clarifying this point, we should recall that the question 
of orders of magnitude first emerges in the work of Gaston Bachelard— of 
whose work Simondon is a thinker, engaging with it in constant dialogue 
(his other great interlocutor being Canguilhem)— as and through the 
question of the instrument, inasmuch as it demands phenomenotechnical 
thought. In the twentieth century, this is what becomes clear in the field of 
physics, when the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics pose, in a 
precise way, the question of the relativity of scale.

The concept of tertiary protention echoes what I have myself tried to 
think as tertiary retention, doing so, again, via a reconsideration of the 
question of imagination in Kant’s first version of Critique of Pure Reason 
(1781). I argued in the third volume of Technics and Time that tertiary re-
tention is the condition of possibility of the play between what Husserl 
called primary retention and secondary retention and that this hidden 
condition (generated by the technical exteriorization of vital movement 
on the basis of which André Leroi- Gourhan described hominization as 
a process of the conquest of space and time through its technicization) is 
also the condition of the schematism of the understanding, which is itself 
the condition of the transcendental deduction of the categories.



 FOREWORD xi

Yuk Hui shows that digital tertiary retention requires of philosophy 
and science that they describe this new type of object, the digital object, 
in terms of digital protention, in an automated milieu itself constituted 
through algorithmically implemented recursive functions. The algorith-
mic belongs to the history of what, after Sylvain Auroux, I call a process 
of grammatization: the digital and thoroughly reticulated milieu is the 
most advanced stage of this grammatization. This is what the digital ob-
ject as conceived by Yuk Hui tries to specify: the digital object constitutes 
what he calls discursive relations. It is on the basis of these discretised rela-
tions that the digital object is woven, reticulating itself and thereby estab-
lishing its existential relations.

The goal of this enterprise is Simondonian inasmuch as it continues 
the project of reconciling culture and technics. But it does so in a context 
in which the opposition and misunderstanding between culture and tech-
nics are being staged in a terrible and dramatic way— such is the context of 
“social engineering” in general, and Facebook in particular, whose regular-
ized schemas form key examples in On the Existence of Digital Objects.

The digital object— that is, the computational object— is of technical 
essence. But it is not reducible to the technical object as Heidegger and 
Simondon allow it to be thought. Yuk Hui shows that we must go beyond 
Simondon to think technical individuation if we are to be able to take 
account of what no longer constitutes a technical milieu but is instead a 
dissociation at the heart of a dynamic that Thomas Berns and Antoinette 
Rouvroy describe as algorithmic governmentality, which gives rise to the 
question of what Evgeny Morozov calls a politics of technology in the con-
text of the data economy.

The digital object remains, from the perspective of the modern thought 
of the object (or, in ancient times, of substance), highly enigmatic: it is an 
object neither of experience nor of intuition in the Kantian sense— a sta-
tus it shares with the scientific objects that emerge from scientific instru-
ments.7 The digital object may consist of data, données, but this is not the 
result of a donation in the sense this is understood by Jean- Luc Marion, 
for example, when he revisits the phenomenological conception. Digital 
objects consist of data, metadata, data formats, “ontologies,” and other for-
malisms that all fall within the process of grammatization, and it is as such 
that they form a digital milieu woven through these relations— alongside 
other objects. But this implies the possibility not just of an associated mi-
lieu but of a dissociated milieu, giving rise to new forms of both individu-
ation and disindividuation. The digital object, formed through recursive 



xii FOREWORD

functions and thereby constituting a new digital protention, is program-
mable. This programmability is highly pharmacological (in the Platonic 
sense given to us in Phaedrus), and the question of the therapy and thera-
peutics required by this digital pharmakon amounts to a new question of 
givenness, that is, of donation.8

This is so because human beings exist only under the condition of the 
anticipation of death, which is a protention they hold in common, but is 
also their impossible protention (an impossibility in common: death as 
what will never arrive, as what they will never live through, an indeter-
mination in common inscribed in the heart of noetic life). They record 
their potential undetermined “protentiality” in tertiary retentions9 that 
constitute the network and the milieu of their Besorgen— and through 
which they are constantly threatened with the loss of all Sorge, this loss 
being a forgetting. They must, in other words, externalize their memory in 
the technics of “language, writing, tools, and gestures,” as Yuk Hui recalls, 
and it is as such that technics constitutes the already- there conditioning 
the historicity of which Heidegger named Dasein.

Hence existential questions do arise in the digital milieu, a milieu in 
which, as Hui says in chapter 6, “the human mind can make sense of recur-
sion but can hardly keep track of the recursive process.” It is a question of 
what happens when the coupling of man and machine becomes reticulated 
(between many machines and many humans) via digital social networks. 
And it is precisely on this point, and after having introduced the question 
of a computational hermeneutics,10 that the question of tertiary proten-
tion arises: Hui states, “When both humans and machines are understood 
from the fundamental perspective of relations, it produces a new faculty, 
which . . . I term tertiary protention.”

The new form of protention, which passes again through the question 
of passive synthesis and of repetition in Difference and Repetition, results 
from the industrialization of categories and algorithms. It is in this way 
that a new synthesis of time occurs, set up by the digital object as tertiary 
protention, and in this situation, “modern technologies bring us much 
convenience, but this convenience as an expression of convergence (in 
terms of functionalities as well as of time and space) also threatens to re-
place care structures (both individual and collective) with the machine 
form of ‘care’ ” (chapter 6).

It is, then, a question of “searching for a new structure of care,” con-



 FOREWORD xiii

fronted with what presents itself as a “dividuation” in the sense in which 
Félix Guattari and then Gilles Deleuze referred to the “dividuals” pro-
duced by the analytical grammatization of psychic and collective indi-
viduals in societies of control, wherein “the attention of each social atom 
[is] sliced into ever smaller pieces and dispersed across the networks by 
status updates, interactions, advertisements— the mechanisms of tertiary 
protention— for marketing purposes” (chapter 6).

Yuk Hui concludes his book by opening up a perspective that I call 
organologico- political, a perspective that projects the conditions of pos-
sibility of the reconstitution of existential protentions in the digital milieu 
through the creation of a new architecture of networks of tertiary proten-
tions. In the digital milieu, this possibility depends on inscribing a process 
of collective individuation formalized by participation in the formation 
of one or many groups that constitute horizons of existential protentions. 
Such processes operate through “creative constraint,” where “the user can 
only use the full functions when he or she participates in a group or cre-
ates a project” (chapter 6), and thereby enable the constitution of an as-
sociated milieu. Hence Yuk Hui replaces the graphs of Jacob Moreno with 
processes of collective individuation in the Simondonian sense.

This approach thus falls within what, at Ars Industrialis and the Institut 
de recherche et d’innovation (IRI), we call general organology. The latter 
is always both theoretical and practical. The works with which Yuk Hui 
concludes are those he conducted at IRI with Harry Halpin. These works 
are currently being undertaken from within the perspective of a herme-
neutic web, wherein the formation of project management groups— 
reconstituting existential protentions in and through processes of collec-
tive individuation that are also processes of transindividuation— occurs 
on the basis of a graphical language of annotations that are shared and 
through which confrontations can be staged, on a contributory herme-
neutic platform and in an online educational context.

· INTRODUCTION ·

Outline of an Investigation on Digital Objects

Humans have always lived in a hybrid environment surrounded by artificial and natural objects. The artificial and the natural are not 
two separate realms, nor are artificial objects simply instruments with 
which to conquer the natural; instead, they constitute a dynamic system 
that conditions human experience and existence. And precisely because 
the artificial is constantly developing toward greater concretization, it 
demands constant reflection on its singular historical condition. The mi-
lieu in which we live has also changed. Videotapes have been replaced 
by YouTube videos, and dinner invitations are no longer issued through 
letters, less and less by telephone calls and e- mails, but more often by 
Facebook event invitations. These objects are basically data, sharable and 
controllable; they can be made visible or invisible through the configu-
ration of the system. This book proposes to conduct an investigation of 
these digital objects. The reader may already have different ideas of what 
a digital object is, for example, a bug, a virus, a hardware component, a 
gadget, a piece of code, a bunch of binary numbers. To allow for a more fo-
cused investigation, I will limit the scope of this book to data. By digital ob-
jects, I mean objects that take shape on a screen or hide in the back end of 
a computer program, composed of data and metadata regulated by struc-
tures or schemas. Metadata literally means data about data. Schemas are 
structures that give semantic and functional meaning to the metadata; in 
computation, they are also called ontologies— a word that has immediate 
associations with philosophy. The following Figure 1 shows a very simple 
digital object— a piece of contact information for Martin Heidegger— in 
which we are presented with metadata that describe the person Heidegger 
(as someone who knows Bertrand Russell), this metadata being schema-
tized using a Web ontology called FOAF (Friend of a Friend).

Digital objects are, of course, not only limited to contacts; in general, 
they constitute a new form of industrial object that pervades every as-
pect of our lives in this time of ubiquitous media— such as online videos,

images, text files, Facebook profiles, and invitations. If we look at the 
Facebook Graph API, which describes how the Facebook data network 
is formed,1 we should not be surprised to find that all the elements are 
defined by the Facebook engineers as objects (Figure 2). They exist both 
on the screen, where we can interact with them, and in the back end, or 
inside the computer program. They are quite similar to objects used in 
object- oriented programming, except that they don’t have computational 
functions. Our inquiry will focus mainly on the general concept of the 
digital object and the representation and categorization of digital objects, 
and less on object- oriented programming, which would deserve another 
book of its own. Despite their popularity, the nature of digital objects is 
still to be clarified. This assertion is to be understood in two ways. First, 
philosophical conceptualizations of the object, as developed, for instance, 
from Aristotle to late modern philosophy, passing by thinkers such as 
Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Husserl, have mainly been concerned with 
questions of the substance and appearance of things, have largely been 
limited to the understanding of natural objects and have thus been unable 
to address the question of digital objects. When these conceptual schemas 
are applied to the understanding of a technical object, such as a machine, 
they simply treat it as though it were a natural object, such as a tree in the 
garden. Second, within computer science, a strong notion of the object is

 INTRODUCTION 3

still lacking, because its use is mostly concerned with the production of 
data and the harvesting of correlations and patterns (especially in the case 
of Big Data). Engineering falls short in the sense that it limits its under-
standing of digital objects to a set of structures for representation (in the 
sense that form is understood in hylomorphistic thinking), that is, to prac-
tical applications. By the same token, reflections on digital media in recent 
decades have focused on the digital and on information, and increasingly 
on data, while the notion of the digital object is still to be elucidated. In 
short, digital objects are conceived as pragmatic engineering questions or 
as phenomena of the digital, whereas their thinghood and their existential 
status have rarely been brought into question.

To elaborate on the existence of digital objects is the task of the rest 
of this book. The investigation presupposes a reciprocal relation between 
computation and philosophy. Some of the questions of computation were 
already posed as epistemological questions. For example, what is inten-
tionality? What is collectivity? Conversely, computation relies on a new 
type of materiality that disrupts some of the concepts that are fundamen-
tal to philosophy, for example, what is an object? Does a digital object 
have substance (or is it possible to talk about it in this way)? This dynamic 
constitutes what I understand as an interdisciplinary mode, which is not a 
unification of different divisions of labor but rather always presumes their 
underlying unity. In this introduction, I explain further why a theory of 
the digital object is needed and how I undertake this task here, presenting 
my central research questions and methodologies. The remainder of the 
introduction presents the book’s key concerns and is organized according 
to a reversed order of the title of this book: object– digital– existence.

Part I, “Object,” paves the path to an understanding of the emergence 
of digital objects in the history of philosophy. I don’t mean by this that 
digital objects had already been anticipated by traditional metaphysics but 
rather that as digital objects have emerged as a consequence of histori-
cal and technological development, so have they also inherited certain

4 INTRODUCTION

metaphysical presuppositions. I am therefore proposing to identify the 
digital object as the subject matter of philosophy, just as the natural ob-
ject and the technical object were before it. I explain the notion of natu-
ral object in the phenomenological tradition of Hume, Kant, Hegel, and 
Husserl, as well as giving an account of the transition to the consideration 
of technical objects in Heidegger and Simondon, to foreground the con-
sideration of digital objects. I also briefly distinguish this project from 
Graham Harman’s object- oriented ontology, in terms of their respective 
readings of Heidegger.

Part II, “Digital,” introduces the notion of the digital and hence digital 
objects. I look at the concept of the digital from Leibniz to contemporary 
thinkers such as Gregory Chaitin and Edward Fredkin, for whom the digi-
tal could be understood as a system that can effectively express the world, 
including its phenomena and its essence. I also contrast Luciano Floridi’s 
approach with Chaitin and Fredkin’s digital physics, because Floridi has 
developed a philosophy of information and has made serious criticisms 
of their approaches. Finally, I go back to my own notion of digital objects 
and sketch there a materialist theory of relation.

In Part III, “Existence,” I elaborate on the methodology of this study, 
which comes from a reading of Gaston Bachelard and Simondon, namely, 
the method of analysis according to orders of magnitude or granularity 
(ordres des grandeurs), and explain its similarities with and differences 
from the levels of abstractions employed in engineering. With this meth-
odology, we will have a new perspective from which to address the ques-
tion of existence and the problematic of the existence of digital objects. 
Existence first presents us with an ontological question concerning be-
ings (ens, Seiendes) as actual entities: where do they come from? How are 
they developed? This has fundamentally to do with formal ontology and 
formal logic: the former is always present but has also become a specific 
discipline in the work of figures such as Barry Smith, Nicola Guarino, and 
others; the latter has always been studied, though followed without being 
questioned (except among certain mathematicians).

Second, Part III concerns the question of Being (esse, Sein), that is, 
what, really, is an object? What are the meanings of being— there and 
in their relation to the world and humans? These two terms (being and 
Being), though both bound to the term ontological, are nevertheless in 
conflict with each other, because they refer to two different interpreta-



 INTRODUCTION 5

tions of the world and constitute what Heidegger calls the “ontological 
difference.” The introduction concludes by inviting the reader to engage 
with the political agenda of this book, which, coming out of the reading of 
Heidegger’s and Simondon’s philosophical projects, concerns the search 
for different modes of reticulation and convergence. As Heidegger and 
Simondon observed, though the development of technologies is bring-
ing things closer, for example, with the invention of the telephone or the 
Internet, in fact, it produces opposite effects. For Heidegger, we are mov-
ing further away from what he calls the thing (das Ding), which is also a 
profound relation between human and world; for Simondon, the diver-
gence of knowledge production between science and technology, theory 
and practice, leads to the opposition between culture and technics, and so 
we need a new philosophical thought to bring society together, hence the 
technics can be reinscribed in culture.

Object

Natural Objects: Between Substance and Subject

Speaking of natural objects doesn’t mean speaking of objects given by 
nature, such as vegetables or animals. A natural object here refers to the 
category and perspective in which every object, whether natural or fabri-
cated, is analyzed in the same natural manner. This method proposes that 
an object can be understood by grasping its essence, which determines 
its particular being. This process of knowing, at first glance, already pre-
supposes the object itself and the object for knowledge. This leads to the 
development of a scientific knowledge that works toward an absolute cer-
tainty, one that guarantees the correspondence between the thing itself 
and consciousness. In Categories, Aristotle proposes to understand being 
in terms of substance and accidents. Substance is the subject that under-
lies a thing and bears the title hypokeimenon. He writes, “That which is 
called a substance most strictly primarily and most of all— is that which 
is neither said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the individual man or the 
individual horse.”2 Neither is the genre “man” or “horse” substance, be-
cause they cannot be observed in the subject; they can be only said of the 
subject.3 Accidents are the predicates of the subject. Clearly, in Categories, 
Aristotle designates the subject– predicate pairing both as a grammatical 
structure and as a system of classification. The relation between language 



6 INTRODUCTION

as classification and things as physical beings is already established: the 
primary substance in Categories remains a universal “this,” which is a com-
position of both matter and form.

Aristotle gives a more detailed, though somewhat divergent account of 
substance in Metaphysics (book Z), where he says that the question “what 
is being?” really amounts to “what is substance?”4 Here substance takes 
the title of essence (οὐσία). He then proposes to understand the substance 
of the substratum. The substratum can be described in terms of sensible 
form and matter. Sensible form is concerned with “what kind of thing” a 
thing is, and matter concerns “what it is made of.” Aristotle proposes to 
decide which of the three elements— form, or matter, or the composite of 
form and matter— can be called substance. Aristotle rejected both matter 
and the composite, the former because it can be a predicate of the subject, 
and the latter because it is “posterior in nature and familiar to sense.”5 He 
finally decided that form is the sole acceptable way of understanding the 
substratum.

It is worth noticing here that Aristotle used the word eidos instead of 
morphe for form. Aristotle uses eidos when he refers to an artificial object, 
for example, when an architect has the form of a house in mind, hence 
οὐσία, as τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι (what it already was) is closely related to eidos, and 
he uses morphe in the general understanding that being is composed of 
form and matter.6 There are two points we should note here: first, that the 
question of substantial form became an enduring philosophical question 
concerning the essence of things and their representation, which present 
at the same time a determination of both matter and intellect, and sec-
ond, that the subject and object distinction did not come to be made until 
Descartes, so that until this point, the thing under contemplation is a sub-
ject but not an object. The concept of subject as distanced from thing in 
favor of its association with the ego that contemplates it is characteristic of a 
separate yet also long- running mediation between subject (consciousness/
noesis) and substance (essence).7

The subject– substance question can be understood as the core ques-
tion of the philosophical conceptuality of natural objects.8 Instead of en-
gaging with its further development in medieval philosophy, I propose to 
move directly to consideration of the phenomenological approach as it 
developed from Hume to Husserl, which always understands the object 
as an object of experience. The trajectory pursued will aim to sketch out 
the metaphysical foundations of natural objects. It will also explain why 



 INTRODUCTION 7

the phenomenological tradition fails to comprehend technical and digital 
objects. British empiricism has always been skeptical of substance because 
this tradition already presupposes that phenomena should be understood 
as bundles of empirical sense data. An earlier empiricist such as John Locke 
therefore questions the existence of substance yet remains indecisive re-
garding it and leaves the question open.9 Hume, however, totally rejects 
the idea of substance. His argument runs like this: every idea is developed 
from sense impressions; this necessarily entails encountering something, 
giving rise to a moment of knowing. If substance can be known, then we 
should have an idea or impression of substance, yet this impression is 
absent. From this point, Hume takes substance out of his philosophical 
analysis because it is something that cannot be demonstrated. Knowledge 
of a thing, according to Hume, results from the synthesis of sense data 
through associations. He proposes a system of relations based on which 
the bundles of sense data are able to give us a sense of the object’s unity. 
Hume’s theory of relations, as I propose in chapter 3, can help shed new 
light on the understanding of digital objects. But Hume’s relations lead to 
a passive synthesis, as if they come into being automatically, and he is not 
able to explain the necessity of such a unity.

Kant attempts to solve Hume’s puzzle and reconcile empiricism with 
rationalism in his Critique of Pure Reason. Kant proposes a formal struc-
ture, which he argues underlies the conditions of possibility of experience. 
The formal structure for Kant is transcendental, meaning it is outside of 
the empirical field. In this work, Kant proposes that a synthetic a priori 
is possible. This is a contradiction in terms from the perspective of either 
empiricism or rationalism. For empiricism, every experience is a poste-
riori, hence synthesis, as something empirical, cannot be a priori. For ra-
tionalism, in contrast, what is a priori is outside of the empirical field and 
thus necessarily transcends experience. Here the formal structure serves 
a system of a priori functions leading to a synthesis that is also formally 
a priori. In Kant’s architectonic in Critique of Pure Reason, this formalism 
is divided into three parts: the first is the transcendental aesthetic, which 
proposes time and space as two pure intuitions; the second is the tran-
scendental analytic, which carries out the transcendental deduction and 
proposes the categories of understanding; and the third is the transcen-
dental dialectic, which concerns the use and misuse of pure reason. Kant’s 
categories are divided into four groups, in which the last categories are the 
syntheses of the previous two. These categories work as schemata, while 



8 INTRODUCTION

sense data are subsumed under them and concepts are created through 
the process of transcendental apprehension. This process of understand-
ing produces two distinct interpretations, which we will deal with in de-
tail later. The first interpretation is adopted by ontologists and computer 
scientists. It involves the creation of prosthetic schemata, for example, the 
metadata scheme, which produces the object through its intrinsic logical 
functionalities.10 The second interpretation takes a very different approach 
from the first. It follows that of Martin Heidegger in Kant and the Problem 
of Metaphysics, which proposes to understand it as a temporal process 
rather than a logical operation.

Kant’s efforts to lay down the conditions of possibility of experience is 
nevertheless a conservative move, because for Kant, the question of sub-
stance still cannot be fully answered. It appears under another name as the 
“thing- in- itself ” (Ding an sich), which takes shelter in the realm of nou-
mena instead of in the domain of phenomena. What we can know of the 
object of experience according to Kant is only phenomenal experience, 
that is to say, the sensibles of the object, while we are not able to grasp 
what is really in the thing itself. This ability would demand an intellectual 
intuition that is lacking in human beings and only present in God. Kant 
proposes here the finitude of knowledge because its certitude is limited to 
the realm of phenomena and hence leaves room for faith. This conserva-
tive move was criticized by philosophers like Fichte and Schelling, who 
came after Kant, and, most powerfully and influentially, Hegel.

In Kant we see a separation between the knowledge of the object and 
the object itself. Knowledge is part of our experience within the objective 
world. The object becomes known when a bundle of sense data are syn-
thesized. The transcendental faculties present themselves as a system of 
instruments, which renders perception and synthesis possible. Hegel, like 
Fichte and Schelling, refused the idea of the thing- in- itself as unknown;

 INTRODUCTION 9

indeed, Fichte and Schelling reproached Kant and proposed the intellec-
tual intuition as fundamental to any human knowledge.11 Hegel refused 
the intellectual intuition as the absolute beginning12 and proposed a rec-
onciliation between substance and subject through the dialectical move-
ment of the in- and- for- itself. Hegel’s motivation is the same as that of the 
Enlightenment philosophers, who saw themselves as working within a 
scientific spirit of philosophy, seeking to reconstitute philosophy as a true 
science. In opposition to Kant, Hegel restores the importance of reason to 
the full articulation of constitutive concepts.13 In Kant, as we saw, under-
standing serves as a formal structure that allows the transcendental appre-
hension of objects, while reason has no role in this process besides serv-
ing as a reflection of it. Recognizing that Kant’s understanding is formal 
and empty, Hegel proposes that speculative reason is the starting point 
from which to move toward true experience. Knowledge for Hegel is not 
the instrument or means by which to analyze objects. Rather, knowledge 
itself,14 especially philosophical knowledge, is truth and absolute. Hegel 
formulated this proposition at the beginning of The Phenomenology of 
Spirit to overcome directly the discrepancy between the thing- in- itself and 
consciousness.

It is worth considering Hegel’s proposal at this point, as will be relevant 
to our discussion later on. Against the empiricists and against Kant’s pro-
posal that objects appear as a result of the synthesis of bundles of sensa-
tion, Hegel understands an object to be a whole. His proposition is made 
clear in the lesser Logic, in the third division concerning the Development 
of the Object.15 Hegel finds the mechanical and chemical view insufficient 
and proposes to approach the object through its totality. The bundle 
theory itself is insufficient because it calls for a mechanical system able 
to synthesize the data through logical operations and procedures. The 
bundle theory, or atomism, if I can call it as such, has then been totally 
absorbed in computation. Hegel therefore seeks to give us a new system 
that will show how this whole is given as the appearance of the object. An 
excerpt from The Phenomenology of Spirit, the introduction of which was 
paraphrased by Heidegger paragraph by paragraph in his lecture “Hegel’s 
Concept of Experience,” gives us a clear picture of what Hegel proposes 
as the perception of unity (not only the unity of perception)16 and the 
dialectical movement toward the Absolute. The object we experience in 
our encounter already enters consciousness as the being for us. The dis-
tinction between the in- it- self of the object and our consciousness of it 



10 INTRODUCTION

is overcome, according to Hegel, by “the nature of the object which we 
are investigating. Since consciousness provides itself with its own stan-
dard, the investigation will be a comparison of consciousness with its own 
self.”17 What Hegel means by overcoming the opposition is actually the 
step of moving the substance to the plane of the subject. Now the object 
exists as an object for us, and it is immediately present as two different 
identities: the in- it- self for consciousness and the knowledge of itself in 
consciousness.18 Reason’s examination of these two produces the second 
in- itself for consciousness. This understanding of experience presupposes 
from the very beginning that the in- it- self of the object is already retained 
and that reason’s role is to undergo a dialectical movement to arrive at its 
concept (Begriff). The Absolute, is not an absolute Absolute but a differ-
entiated Absolute marked by the subject’s self- consciousness, especially 
when we consider Hegel’s concept of history as the history of the progress 
of self- consciousness.

Compared with his philosophy of history, which gained much more 
attention through Marx, Hegel’s phenomenology as a science of cognition 
has not been developed much further besides in historical studies on ideal-
ism. Instead, another type of phenomenology came to the fore, founded 
by Edmund Husserl and known as descriptive phenomenology. The very 
use of the word description clearly distinguishes Husserl from Hegel. For 
Husserl, phenomenology is a descriptive process that goes back and forth 
to depict the object through the knowing of consciousness, whereas for 
Hegel, phenomenology is a speculative process in which multiple stages 
of self- consciousness are attained through dialectical movements and sub-
lations. However, they are not totally separated, because Husserl’s phe-
nomenology is another investigation into consciousness and an attempt 
to provide the absolute foundation of all science. From this perspective, 
Husserl and Hegel share the same ambition.19

Husserl’s phenomenology also rejected Kant’s thing- in- itself as being 
a mystery and proposed that we can actually know the object through the 
movements of intentionality. Because Husserl starts as an arithmetician, 
subsequently becoming a philosopher of logic and consciousness, and 
finally a philosopher of culture, it is almost impossible to summarize a 
theory of the object in a way that captures his entire understanding. But 
in a nutshell (because Husserlian logic will be explained in detail in chap-
ter 5), Husserl regards everything as a possible intentional object; for ex-



 INTRODUCTION 11

ample, a number is just as much an object as an apple. Husserl’s project is 
directed against what he called naive realism and relativism: an object for 
Husserl is not what it is given; rather, this given is constituted by a genesis 
of the senses. To relinquish naive, the phenomenologist starts with epoché, 
meaning the bracketing of any presuppositions and bias, which already 
constitutes the object as such. The bracketing process, to Husserl, is also 
a process of returning to an absolute ego that is free from any presupposi-
tion. An intentional act then comes into being directed from the subject 
to the object, and the reflection that this act effects constitutes a horizon 
on which the ideality of the object appears. This ideality is only possible 
through a process of ideation, which reconstitutes the horizon of meaning.

The trajectory of the modern philosophies of objects demonstrated by 
these key figures mentioned opens up several general directions for the 
investigation of objects. First, there is a wavering skepticism regarding 
the concept of substance. The transcendence of substance finds its place 
in God; in other words, substance hides in the emanation of God and 
is therefore beyond human experience. The risk involved in an absolute 
knowledge of the object easily leads to the destruction of the transcendent 
plane by bringing it down to the plane of immanence. This philosophical 
trajectory also accompanies the scientific spirit in working toward the dis-
covery and reassurance of the power of scientific methods. Second, con-
sciousness is the ultimate mystery, and no authority can describe for itself 
the ultimate, eternal truth. These multiple models attempt to comprehend 
the mind, and they assign different mechanisms to it. This is important, 
because the mind is the same as the object of inquiry (even if it is much 
more complicated), and we can also pose the question of the thing- in- 
itself of the mind just as we may do for a fillet of steak or a cauliflower. 
In Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Husserl, it is not only that consciousness is 
imbued with specific functions, which are also systemized as part of an 
organon of knowing (although none of them would admit the applicability 
of the word organon). Third, the role of knowing falls totally to the mind. 
The other side of the coin is that objects are always objects of experience. 
The predicates of the objects are qualities that can be experienced, so all 
of the preceding philosophers are eager to find the structure of conscious-
ness that would allow it to know the object, whereas they undertake less 
investigation into the object’s own existence and how its existence condi-
tions the process of knowing and being itself.



12 INTRODUCTION

Technical Objects: From Substance to Milieu

The dialectics of substance and subject has been debated between realism 
and idealism. Technological unconsciousness in philosophy has meant 
that it has failed to absorb the rapid development of technology and social 
change after the Industrial Revolution. The idea of the philosopher as a 
figure who stands outside as mere critic and defends the purity of thought 
and inquiry into human nature has been washed away in the flux of tech-
nological progress. It is possible to argue that most of the philosophers 
mentioned earlier, except Husserl, came before the Industrial Revolution 
and therefore dismissed technical objects. Technical objects here are not 
necessarily complicated machines; a hammer or a knife is also a techni-
cal object. Indeed, Husserl, the philosopher among those discussed who 
did witness the rapid proliferation of machines after the Industrial Revolu-
tion, didn’t take them into account in his phenomenological theory.20 A 
new philosophical attitude as well as a new philosophical system must be 
constituted to comprehend the changes that this process entailed.21 If on-
tology starts with the question of being, then there is a problem in that the 
understanding of being is not on the right path if it does not take into ac-
count the nature of technics. And this is very clear if we follow Heidegger’s 
proposition that the beginning of cybernetics is the end of metaphysics.22 
I will therefore propose two figures who may bring the concept of techni-
cal objects to light and prepare the ground for our investigation of digital 
objects: the French philosopher Gilbert Simondon (1924– 89) and the 
German philosopher Martin Heidegger may appear at first glance to be 
incompatible, as Simondon is an admirer of modern technology, whereas 
Heidegger is known as a philosopher who was opposed to it. The recon-
ciliation between Simondon and Heidegger will be proposed in chapters 
3 and 4, but here I briefly note how Simondon and Heidegger addressed 
different aspects of the nature of technical objects.

Simondon in On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects (1958), pro-
posed what he calls a mechanology. Mechanology investigates the existence 
of technical objects through its evolution and the relation between objects 
and their milieu, with an ultimate aim to resolve the problem of industrial 
alienation, which is resultant from the misunderstanding and ignorance 
of technologies. Simondon’s ambition was not to add one more branch 
to philosophy but rather to reestablish the metaphysical foundation of 
philosophy as a whole. His project started with the rejection of hylomor-



 INTRODUCTION 13

phism, which considers objects in terms of form and matter. We could also 
say that hylomorphism is closely related to substance– predicate thinking, 
because it is an already individuated form that gives matter its essence. 
Instead of forms, Simondon proposed to understand technical objects 
through the modulation of causal relations of different parts. He showed 
how these relations are constructed in a process going from technical ele-
ments to technical individuals and then to ensembles. Simondon calls 
this evolutionary process the concretization of technical objects. We can 
understand what he means by concretization from the example of the evo-
lution from the diode to the Lee de Forest triode. The triode is an evolved 
version of the diode, which is a device that controls the flow of current in 
a single direction. In its simplest form, within a vacuum tube, the cathode 
is heated and hence activated to release electrons. The anode is positively 
charged so that it attracts electrons from the cathode. When the voltage 
polarity is reversed, the anode is not heated and thus cannot emit elec-
trons. Hence there is no current passing through. A triode places a grid 
between the anode and the cathode; a DC current can give a bias to the 
grid: if it is negative, it will repel some of the electrons back to the cathode 
and hence serve as an amplifier. Simondon proposes that the absolute be-
ginning of the triode is not the diode but is to be found “in the condition

of irreversibility of the electrodes and the phenomenon of the transport of 
electric charges across the vacuum.”23

A technical individual is a technical object that supports the function-
ing of its inner structure, at the same time as it is able to incorporate an ex-
ternal milieu into its functioning. This external milieu is what Simondon 
calls the associated milieu (milieu associé), which provides a stabilizing 
function that restores the equilibrium of the system itself. Simondon’s ap-
proach to technical objects differs from those of previous philosophers 
and phenomenologists in that he does not reduce the technical object to 
the intentional defect of consciousness, making it an object for knowledge. 
He proposed to study the genesis of the technical object itself in terms of 
the degrees of concretization and develop a philosophy that is compatible 
with technical objects. A technical object regains its materiality and attains 
a different degree of concreteness or perfection in contrast to what cyber-
netics terms “control.” Simondon also noticed that the concretization of 
technical objects allows them to move toward the status of natural objects:

The concrete technical object, that is to say the evolved, comes 
close to the mode of existence of natural objects, it tends towards 
an internal coherence, towards the closure of the system of causes 
and effects exerted circularly inside its enclosure, moreover it in-
corporates a part of the natural world that intervenes as condition 
of function, and therefore takes part in the system of causes and 
effects.24

A technical object, if we can understand it ontologically, is a unity of rela-
tions. Indeed, Simondon uses the word relation frequently without cate-
gorizing it. We can say that the object’s perfection is also the development 
of its relations. The relations of a technical element are limited to its in-
ternal operation. Consider, for example, the diode, which is regulated by 
voltage and polarity: when it becomes an individual, it extends its rela-
tions to an outer milieu and makes these relations an indispensable part 
of its identity. In On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects, Simondon 
sees individualization as the method by which to peep into the evolution 
of technical objects and its relation to the human world. Here we need 
to distinguish two words Simondon used: individualization and individu-
ation. Simondon talked about the individualization of technical objects, 
but not about their individuation. Individualization concerns functions: 



 INTRODUCTION 15

somatic specializations and psychic schematization; when the term is ap-
plied to living beings, it denotes the development and division between 
the psychic and the soma. Individuation, conversely, concerns the genesis 
and resolution of tensions to arrive at a metastable equilibrium, which ex-
presses as phase changes. We can probably say that individualization de-
mands a hierarchy that puts different elements into a functioning order, 
whereas individuation produces, not a hierarchy, but rather a “hierarchical 
relativity.”25

Simondon frequently explains individuation with the example of crys-
tallization.26 Consider a saturated chemical solution, for example, sodium 
chloride (salt). Before it crystallizes, the saturated chemical solution is in 
a metastable state, which means that it is highly unstable. When it is sub-
jected to a small amount of heat, it starts to crystallize. Modern chemistry 
has taught us that new bonds are established between the ions in a regu-
lated pattern to minimize the repulsion between negative ions, and this pat-
tern is extended progressively throughout the sodium chloride solution. 
In the crystallization process, there is no single identity, and those that are 
already crystallized serve as the foundation and catalyst for further crystal-
lization (by releasing heat). Individuation demands three types of condi-
tions in this case (and in general): (1) energetic, (2) material, and (3) in-
formational and generally nonimmanent. These three conditions could be 
understood through relations, because Simondon proposes that “relation 
is not an accident related to a substance, but a constitutive, energetic and 
structural condition that goes on in the existence of the constituted be-
ings.”27 Following Simondon, we can talk about the individualization of 
the digital object, which is the task of chapter 1, through an investigation of 
the history of markup languages. But in contrast to Simondon, I propose 
to understand the individuation of digital objects. This has been a focus 
of speculation that has preoccupied me for some years: what motivated 
Simondon to write his supplementary thesis Du mode d’existence des objets 
techniques (1958) after the main thesis L’Individuation à la lumière des no-
tions de forme et d’information (the two parts of this book were published 
separately under the titles L’individu et sa genèse physico- biologique [1964] 
and L’individuation psychique et collective [1989]), in which he kind of 
moved from the richer notion of individuation to individualization? I can-
not devote too much space in this book to scholarly explanations for this 
historical development, but I would like to emphasize that I consider it to 
be central to the political agenda of Simondon, which is to overcome the 



16 INTRODUCTION

alienation caused by technological development (this is stated on the first 
page of the book and reappears throughout). If we want to address the 
human– machine– world relation, then some thoughts on the individua-
tion of digital objects have to be posed both philosophically and politi-
cally. This necessity, which was not made explicit in Simondon’s writings, 
will be pursued in this book.

I believe Heidegger provided a way of understanding relations that con-
trasts with that of Simondon, yet one that may provide us with some useful 
conceptual resources for the task of figuring out a theory of the individua-
tion of objects. Heidegger himself would immediately reject such a claim 
and did indeed doubt the fruitfulness of a theory of relations in Being and 
Time. However, I will demonstrate in chapter 3 why I conceive Heidegger 
to be a philosopher of relations in parallel with Simondon. Heidegger’s 
contribution to the understanding of technical objects can be found in 
Being and Time, where he talks about the “ready- to- hand.” Heidegger pro-
poses two categories: ready- to- handness (Zuhandenheit) and present- at- 
handness (Vorhandenheit). We can understand present- at- hand as a mode 
of comprehension that renders a thing an object for consciousness and 
attempts to arrive at the essence of that object (as in the case of a natural 
object). Ready- to- hand is a mode of interaction, in which we put aside 
the question of ideality and objectivity and let the object appear to us ac-
cording to its functionalities. We see a similar impulse in Simondon and 
Heidegger here, in which the understanding of an object is characterized 
by a move from substance to external milieux. The difference between 
them is that Heidegger bypassed the technical milieu and concentrated 
on the milieu of signification, interpreting the object’s self- manifestation 
within the milieu in terms of relations. For example, Heidegger illustrates 
the way we use a hammer: we don’t really need to achieve an ideality of 
the hammer (as present- at- hand) before we use it; we just grasp it and use 
it to hit the nail into the place it is intended to go. This everyday practical 
activity moves away from the concept of experience as a mere activity of 
consciousness. It argues that the previous understanding of objects, which 
subsumed them under cognition, ignores the dynamic relations between 
both objects and Dasein. For instance, Husserl’s concept of intentional-
ity, according to Heidegger, when properly understood, is nothing but 
the awareness of being- in- the- world; that is to say, it is not a ray projected 
from the ego but a field of relations that the ego has to follow.

In the preceding conceptualization, both Simondon and Heidegger 
propose going back to the objects themselves. I have to admit that I am 



 INTRODUCTION 17

cheating here. For I have bypassed Heidegger’s distinction between ob-
ject (Gegenstand) and thing (Ding), and his critique of modern technol-
ogy. This distinction will be discussed in chapters 2 and 4. “Back to things 
themselves” (zu den Sachen selbst) was the well- known slogan of Husserl’s 
phenomenology. But Husserl’s approach, as I briefly mentioned, still falls 
back into the paradigm of struggle between subject and substance. “Back 
to the technical objects,” a slogan I attribute implicitly to Simondon and 
Heidegger, aims to bypass the solipsism of traditional metaphysics and 
allow the objects to be without a mediator. Both Simondon and Heidegger 
point to the question of relation as a metaphysical understanding of tech-
nical objects. For Simondon, it is the relation in and between the inter-
nal and external that constitutes the dynamic of its individualization. For 
Heidegger, it is the relations of the world that constitute the degree of free-
dom for both things and human Dasein. Here we see that Simondon’s con-
cern for technicity and Heidegger’s for the world supplement each other. 
And I propose that this connection will be able to open up a new perspec-
tive. Yet this project remains open, and it becomes a fundamental question 
for our investigation into the existence of digital objects.

This reading of Heidegger in terms of relations fundamentally distin-
guishes our project from that of Graham Harman’s object- oriented phi-
losophy. Harman’s work resonates with this project because he also devel-
oped his theory from a reading of Martin Heidegger’s ready- to- hand and 
present- at- hand. Indeed, my first encounter of objects and relations was 
through personal correspondence with Harman in 2007, yet I developed 
a very different understanding from Harman’s. For Harman, every object 
is a tool- being. Every tool- being is real and cannot be reduced to atoms 
or smaller physical entities. I share a similar view that the current under-
standing of information or even data as flow as the constitution of the digi-
tal object is possible but not sufficient, but I prefer to understand them as 
different orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, I would like to mention two 
points that fundamentally separate these two projects:

Substance. Harman understands Heidegger to have developed 
the concept of a new substance.28 I contest that substance is 
not a question for Heidegger, because the substance– accident 
pair for him is the beginning of the fault of Western metaphys-
ics. In this project, I refuse totally the concept of substance. 
Heidegger’s task is to replace substance with temporal relations, 
which are not fixed entities but the dynamics of care [Sorge]. 



18 INTRODUCTION

Harman rejected this by saying that Heidegger never had a 
philosophy of time.29 For my reading, if there had been a new 
substance Heidegger wanted to invent, then it would have had 
to be time. Indeed, this thesis follows Heidegger in that time is 
a key issue in the attempt to understand digital objects.

Relations. Harman tries to understand nonrelation instead of rela-
tions, for example, when the object is used as ready- to- hand, it 
withdraws itself not only from Dasein but also from other tools.30 
The Heidegger whom we want to retrieve in this project is a phi-
losopher of relations. Both Zuhandenes and Vorhandenes express 
different relations; the former is time, or what I call existential 
relations, and the latter refers to properties, which I call discur-
sive relations. Harman doesn’t clearly explain what he means 
by relations. In his book on Bruno Latour, Harman character-
izes Latour as the metaphysician of the network and relations, 
but these relations seem to be a kind of force acting from one 
actor on another without concrete analysis. He even makes the 
provocation that the black box (the unknown causality that the 
network of actors works) is the new substance. This ambiguity of 
substance and relations31 may give us irreductionism, but it also 
gives us a metaphysical black box.

Because of these fundamental differences, this book sets out to outline 
a speculation of digital objects and a realism of relations with a different 
point of departure, instead of directly engaging with Harman’s speculative 
realism, though I am aware that there are also different approaches within 
this school of thought concerning objects, notably as found in Ian Bogost’s 
Alien Phenomenology (2011), Levi Bryant’s The Democracy of Objects (2011), 
and the recent works of Timothy Morton. The efforts of these authors are 
well appreciated, but it will not be possible to respond to all of them here 
(such would effectively mean changing the subject of this book).

Digital

Digital Physics and Computational Metaphysics

I hope it is clear from the preceding exploration that the philosophical in-
vestigation of objects underwent a shift following the onset of industrial 



 INTRODUCTION 19

modernity, from what I generalized as the natural object to the techni-
cal object. Here I propose that, correspondingly, a new inquiry into the 
digital object now needs to be carried out. We have many brilliant works 
that have opened up some very interesting and important lines of inquiry 
concerning the concept of the digital, notably Leibniz and the modern 
logicians and engineers, such as Frege, Hilbert, Turing, Gödel, and more 
contemporary thinkers, such as Edward Fredkin, Konrad Zuse, Stephen 
Wolfram, Gregory J. Chaitin, Luciano Floridi, and many others to name. 
The notion of the digital has been known since Leibniz, if we understand 
it in reference to abinary systems. In fact, Leibniz is a figure of fundamen-
tal relevance to the foundation of computer science today. In 1669, in a 
three- page manuscript titled De Progressione Dyadica,32 Leibniz already 
outlined the possibility of using a binary system to perform operations 
of division and multiplication. We can probably understand two notes 
of significance in this invention: the first would be its role in calculation, 
because it effectively reduces representation using ten digits to a system 
using two; the second is associated with what he later calls Characteristica 
Universalis, which is a system of signs (Zeichensystem) that can fully ex-
press all concepts and things in themselves. It is known that Leibniz’s 
binary system and Characteristica Universalis were largely inspired by 
Chinese writing. Through his correspondence with the French Jesuit 
Joachim Bouvet (1656– 1730), Leibniz discovered the I Ching and was sur-
prised to find therein a binary system that had already been in existence 
for millennia. Leibniz understood the binary system as the first ideo-
graphic writing , seeing the later Chinese writing as a further development 
of the ideogram. Differing from the phonographic nature of European 
languages, Chinese writing is ideographic. Considered in this way, Chinese 
writing prefigures the Characteristica Universalis, because it uses a set of 
limited signs to express the world. The Characteristica Universalis is not 
only mathematical but also metaphysical and theological, because it 
deals with the construction of a theory of expression, which is the center-
piece of metaphysics (comme pièce centrale de la métaphysique).33 This 
theory of expression is also at the same time the theory of relations, or 
more precisely, logical relations. We develop this point further in chap-
ter 3. Chaitin, one of the pioneers of algorithmic information theory, 
understands Leibniz as a fundamental thinker who announced four 
hundred years ago the project of the computational universe.34 He cites a 
passage from Leibniz’s Discourse on Metaphysics:



20 INTRODUCTION

God has chosen the most perfect world, that is, the one which 
is at the same time the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in 
phenomena, as might be a line in geometry whose construction 
is easy and whose properties and effects are extremely remarkable 
and widespread.

This is fundamental to any program that wants to express the world: 
it must always seek to be “the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in 
phenomena.” Central to the idea of the Characteristica Universalis is the 
question of how to express the world with limited signs. It was one of the 
reasons Leibniz was excited by Chinese writing and fueled his endeavor to 
discover a writing system more general than that of the Chinese charac-
ters. For Chaitin, likewise, it is necessary that the algorithm that is used to 
represent a particular set or type of data should be smaller than it. Chaitin 
also made the playful proposition that the name “bit” should be changed 
to “Leibniz.”35 Leibniz’s mathematical and philosophical insights led to 
the later development of formal logical systems and calculating machines. 
This history is revisited in chapters 5 and 6 of this book. It is probably in 
terms of this historical trajectory that we can best understand the ideas of 
some digital thinkers, for example, Wolfram’s computational universe and 
Fredkin’s digital physics or digital philosophy. Let me single out here some 
of the basic ideas of Fredkin’s project, which were clearly laid out in his ar-
ticle “An Introduction to the Digital Philosophy.” In the abstract, he wrote,

DP is based on two concepts: bits, like the binary digits in a 
computer, correspond to the most microscopic representation of 
state information; and the temporal evolution of state is a digital 
informational process similar to what goes on in the circuitry of 
a computer processor. We are motivated in this endeavor by the 
remarkable clarification that DP seems able to provide with regard 
to many of the most fundamental questions about processes we 
observe in our world.36

Fredkin, as he himself says, has pushed atomism to an extreme by assum-
ing “that everything is based on some very simple discrete process, with 
space, time, and state all being discrete.”37 According to this vision, physi-
cal laws have to be computationally universal, because they will form the 
basic model that explains the world with algorithms of limited sizes. This 



 INTRODUCTION 21

worldview comes out of quantum mechanics, in which the energy levels of 
atoms are discrete. The operations of bits could be further grasped by two 
mathematical models, one being diaphantine analysis, an area of number 
theory that determines integral solutions of certain algebraic equations, 
the other automata theory, which studies self- operating virtual machines, 
an area Wolfram further advances.

Philosophy of Information

This reflection on the digital is not the whole story. The philosopher of 
information Luciano Floridi made the criticism that the digital ontology 
sets up an opposition between the analog and the digital, because if the 
world is understood digitally, there will be no place for the analog, which 
we still experience every day. Instead of understanding the world as dis-
crete and atomic, Floridi proposed to think of it in terms of information. 
Floridi, in his article “Against Digital Ontology,” shows that digital ontolo-
gists have largely ignored different levels of abstraction, a method that he 
adopted from engineering.38 To put it in simple terms, the level of abstrac-
tion is a method for modeling a system with a given set of data. The ob-
server can have different levels of abstraction depending on her “division” 
or “cut” of granularities. The problem with the digital ontologists is that 
they ignore that there can be different levels of abstraction, instead insist-
ing on there being only one, which is digital. In comparison, Floridi pro-
vides an approach that at least acknowledges human experiences besides 
affirming the importance of information in computation. Floridi’s work 
is important for the study of the digital because he takes the notion of in-
formation much further, moving it beyond computation and cybernetics, 
and attempts to construct a general philosophy of information.

Information, in cybernetics, is something almost ungraspable; how-
ever, it can be communicated and measured by bits and by entropy. The 
founder of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, famously stated that “informa-
tion is information, not matter or energy. No materialism which does not 
admit this can survive in the present day.”39 Claude Shannon and Wiener 
gave two different interpretations of the term information. For Wiener, in-
formation is the measure of organization, as opposed to entropy, which is 
the measure of disorganization. Meanwhile, for Shannon, information in-
dicates the level of surprise and uncertainty: a surprise occurs when there 
is a difference between the expecting (anticipation) and the expected 



22 INTRODUCTION

(outcome). As Shannon’s collaborator Wallen Weaver pointed out, “the 
quantity which uniquely meets the natural requirements that one sets up 
for ‘information’ turns out to be exactly that which is known in thermo-
dynamics as entropy.”40 We can see that Wiener’s and Shannon’s informa-
tion have opposing significations, amounting to two totally different sets 
of qualities. Floridi goes further in showing that information must be 
reappropriated and moved from machines to the world, that is to say, by 
demonstrating that computation is only part of the philosophy of infor-
mation. Hence he calls the world in which we are living after digitization 
the “infosphere,” its name deriving from the word biosphere:

“Infosphere” is a word I coined years ago on the basis of “bio-
sphere,” a term referring to that limited region on our planet that 
supports life. By “infosphere,” then, I mean the whole informa-
tional environment made up of all informational entities (includ-
ing informational agents), their properties, interactions, processes, 
and relations. It is an environment comparable to, but different 
from, “cyberspace” (which is only one of the sub- regions of the 
infosphere, as it were), since the infosphere also includes offline 
and analogue spaces of information.41

Floridi recognizes that this infosphere is radically reshaping our world, be-
cause it “both enable[s] us to create fundamentally new substances that 
didn’t previously exist and enable[s] us to interact with and manipulate 
the world in previously unimagined ways.”42 Floridi even proposes a new 
human called an “inforg,” in contrast to the well- known cyborg.43 In con-
trast to the computational universe, which is atomic, discrete, and uni-
versal, now the world is informational. Floridi makes a classification into 
mathematical information, semantic information, physical information, 
biological information, and economic information and has developed an 
ethics of information. Considering closely the theoretical background of 
both digital ontology and the infosphere, while both have made gestures 
toward new kinds of philosophical thought and new inquiries, ultimately, 
they do not seem to have moved too far away from the established para-
digms of abstract modeling and formal logic.

What is commonly agreed upon in both viewpoints is that informa-
tion is an abstract entity, existing outside of materiality as well as being 
a mathematical entity following the mathematical theory of communica-



 INTRODUCTION 23

tion. Nonetheless, such an understanding of information is inadequate to 
describe our situation, as it already presumes human experience to be a 
matter of calculus and the human to be a cybernetic (if not already com-
putational) machine. It is worth mentioning that Simondon has also de-
veloped a general theory of information, which differs from the cybernetic 
model. Besides of quality and quantity, Simondon understands informa-
tion as signification, and I further showed elsewhere that beyond significa-
tion, there is also the notion of significance, which defines the threshold 
of individuation.44 We will touch upon Simondon’s theory of information 
in chapter 5; now let’s return to Floridi. I think that Floridi’s challenge to 
the digital ontologies provides new ways of looking at computation, but 
I also wonder with regard to both theories whether it will be possible for 
us to retain the notion of objects without being submerged in the ocean 
of the digital and information. Throughout our everyday life, we continue 
to interact with objects alongside information, inducing experiences of 
embodiment, sensation, affection, desire, and so on. Objects cannot be to-
tally reduced to information, just as Floridi argued that the world cannot 
simply be reduced to atoms or bits and signals. Floridi’s use of levels of 
abstraction amounts to a very pragmatic method that opens up a plural-
ism that is overshadowed by monistic view of atoms and the digital. In 
fact, in the following section, we will see that the method I use throughout 
this book, the order of granularities, is very similar to his adoption of the 
levels of abstraction, yet there we will also see some significant differences.

Digital Object: Material Relations to Technical Systems

Can we find another approach that allows us to make an investigation of 
digital objects? I have already hinted (at the end of the section on techni-
cal objects) that it will be important to pick up the concept of relation 
again. Nonetheless, there is no explicit systematic approach to relations in 
the thoughts of Simondon and Heidegger. In fact, in chapter 3, we see that 
Heidegger even rejected the task of developing a theory of relations. I tend 
to argue that it was not philosophical thought itself but rather the develop-
ment of both science and technology based on the substance– predicate 
paradigm that fomented a relational thinking as well as the disillusion-
ment with substance– predicate thinking. That is to say, the substance– 
predicate mode becomes a negation of itself. This logic was discussed 
by Jean- François Lyotard in his theory of the postmodern. Science and 



24 INTRODUCTION

technology were the project of the modern; however, at certain moments 
of their development, they also exposed the limits of the modern— the 
will to master— while the postmodern reveals the unstable, unpredict-
able nature of the universe.45 History expresses a contradiction against its 
own logic. Likewise, the emergence of quantum mechanics by the end of 
the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries showed philoso-
phers the problems with thinking in terms of substance. Objects exist in 
different orders of reality. We can observe an object in terms of its color, 
shape, and texture; we can also describe it in terms of atoms, electrons, or 
smaller particles. How, then, can we articulate the substance in microphys-
ics? Bachelard proposed to replace the word substance with existance, on 
the basis that the former term is useless and dangerous.46 Bachelard’s new 
epistemology centers on the concept of relations: these relations will ac-
tualize according to certain technics or instruments of observation. In his 
article “Le Monde comme caprice et miniature” (1931), Bachelard wrote 
that “at the beginning was relation” (au commencement était la relation).47 
Bachelard also considered this new way of looking at things in terms of 
relations a task and a challenge for metaphysics:

It is in this pellicle that relations with the exterior determine a new 
physic- chemistry. It is there the metaphysician could understand 
the best how the relations determine the structure.48

In parallel, the discovery of relations in logic and its realization in compu-
tational technologies also uncovered the problematic aspects of Aristotelian 
ontology. This was made explicit by the discovery of relational calculus 
in mathematics and later in the invention of the relational database. We 
can observe that though engineers and philosophers of computation use 
technologies of relations, they tend to continue using the word substance 
without really understanding objects relationally. The most important dif-
ference between digital objects and technical objects, in this regard, is that 
whereas, on one hand, digital objects have sped up the collapse of what 
Peter Sloterdjik characterizes as the “substantial fetishism” of occidental 
metaphysics,49 on the other hand, the concretization of digital objects 
has also brought us a technical system consisting of materialized rela-
tions, in which everything has the possibility to connect to other things. 
Compared with earlier technical ensembles that largely relied on referen-
tial relations or signification, as we have seen in Heidegger’s example of 



 INTRODUCTION 25

the ready- to- hand, the technical system is created through digital objects 
(the Web) that constantly transform referential relations in material 
forms. At the center of this view of technical evolution is what I address 
in chapter 4 under the name of “interobjectivity.” Digital objects are at the 
same time logical statements and sources for the formation of networks. 
They are not only a philosophical conceptualization but indeed concrete 
objects. Bertrand Russell, in The Principles of Mathematics,50 dedicated sev-
eral chapters to relations. Russell criticized the fact that mathematics has 
inherited the philosophical error whereby an object has to be thought of 
in terms of subject– predicate propositions. Instead, Russell proposed to 
move relation out of the Aristotelian ontology:

This view is derived, I think, probably unconsciously, from a 
philosophical error: it has always been customary to suppose 
relational propositions less ultimate than class- propositions (or 
subject– predicate propositions, with which class- propositions are 
habitually confounded), and this has led to a desire to treat rela-
tions as a kind of classes.51

Let’s consider a simple example: “Heidegger knows Bertrand Russell” 
or “I am taller than you”— it is impossible to think of these statements 
in terms of subject– predicate class- proposition (I and Russell cannot be 
reduced to a class- proposition; besides, both of us belong to the class 
“human being”), but there is still a need for an independent mathematical 
treatment of such statements. As Russell suggests, they could be expressed 
in the form xRy, in which x is understood as the referent, y as the relatum, 
and R as the relata.52 In modern mathematics and computer science, the 
“relational calculus” has been further developed into two branches (with 
different modes of inquiry): tuple relational calculus53 and domain rela-
tional calculus.54 The Tuple Relational Calculus was introduced by the 
mathematician and information scientist Edgar F. Codd in the 1960s. It 
is part of the relational model, which in turn is the foundation of the rela-
tional database.

This relational technology is further realized by digitization and em-
ployed to develop unified systems. Later, in chapter 1, I show that the digi-
tal shouldn’t be understood merely in terms of ones and zeros but rather 
as the capacity to process data. From the 1970s until the present, with the 
proliferation of personal computers and the development of the Internet 



26 INTRODUCTION

and then the Web, we have seen informational technologies move from a 
specific group of experts into the hands of ordinary users. We have also 
witnessed the emergence and concretization of digital objects, from GML 
through SGML, HTML, XML, and XHTML, and today to the Web on-
tologies proposed in Tim Berners- Lee’s vision of the semantic web. It 
is also the mysterious word ontology that makes the inquiry into digital 
objects strongly related to philosophical studies and allows us to see that 
the technical questions are fundamentally philosophical. To reiterate, the 
digital objects to be discussed in this book are data objects formalized 
by metadata and metadata schemes, which could be roughly understood 
as ontologies. Each object consists of multiple logical statements, as the 
opening of this introduction illustrated.

The emergence of the computer and the popularization of its use for 
massive data processing announced the arrival of information systems 
grounded on a relational view of beings. Edgar Todd’s relational database 
is one of the milestones in this development, and the semantic web cur-
rently being proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium represents the 
updated status of the development of interobjective relations. As a bunch 
of logical statements, digital objects are subsumed under calculation. The 
affectivity and sensibility of the objects are calculable. A digital object’s 
relation to other digital objects will increase through logical inferences, 
even though it has the same content. Networks are created among the 
digital objects being actualized according to certain parameters and algo-
rithms. The multiple networks, which are connected together by proto-
cols and standards, constitute what I call a digital milieu. Jacque Ellul was 
probably the first to notice this evolution and its relevance to data process-
ing in the 1970s. In his book The Technological System (1977), Ellul took 
up Simondon’s concept of objects and ensembles and developed his own 
view of technical systems:

Data processing solves the problem. Thanks to the computer, 
there emerged a sort of internal systematics of the technologi-
cal ensemble, expressing itself by, and operating on, the level of 
information. It is through reciprocal total and integrated informa-
tion that the subsystems are coordinated. This is something that 
no man, no human group, no constitution was able to do. The 
further technicization advanced, the more the technological sec-
tors tended to become independent, autonomous, and incoherent. 



 INTRODUCTION 27

Only the computer can deal with this. But it is quite obvious that 
it cannot be one computer. It has to be an ensemble of computers 
working interrelatedly at all communication points of the system. 
This ensemble becomes the subsystem of connections between the 
different technological subsystems.55

Humans are already integrated in a materialized network that submits to 
manipulation by algorithms, and they also have the capacity to do all these 
things by themselves. This gives us a new motivation to think of the techni-
cal system as no longer separated from the social and economic systems 
but rather as having the power to converge and integrate all as part of its 
functions. Simondon thought of concretization in a similar manner, but in 
the 1950s, it was still too early to anticipate the arrival of the network age. 
The network for Simondon was the limit of technical progress, because 
networks will come to dominate technical activities, while humans won’t 
have the means to change them. The proliferation of the new industrial 
digital objects has changed this situation and thus motivated us to recon-
sider Simondon’s opinion, which he expressed as follows:

One changes tools and instruments, one can construct or repair 
a tool oneself, but one cannot change the network, one doesn’t 
construct oneself a network: one can only tie in with the network, 
adapt to it, participate in it; network dominates and encloses 
[enserrer] the action of individual beings, dominates even every 
technical ensemble.”56

If we can follow well the progress from object to system and material-
ization of relations, then we should ask the question, what do they imply? 
In what way can we approach these objects to further understand their 
existence? This remaining task is pursued in this book by interrogating the 
two types of relations that we have observed in the thoughts of Gilbert 
Simondon and Martin Heidegger and developing their value and insights 
for the understanding of the nature of data as objects.

Why do we approach the question of the existence of digital objects 
from the perspective of data? True, these objects appear to human users 
as colorful and visible beings, yet at the level of programming, they are text 
files; further down the operational system, they are binary codes, and fi-
nally, at the level of circuit boards, they are nothing but signals generated by

 INTRODUCTION 29

voltage values and the operations of logic gates. How might we think about 
these voltage differences as being the substance of a digital object? Search-
ing downward, we may end up with the mediation of silicon and metal. 
And finally, we could go into particles and fields. It would be possible to 
approach from these different layers, but doing so may not be the most 
productive method. In the following section, I explain the methodology 
based on the analysis of orders of magnitude that will allow us to effec-
tively position our inquiries and develop a unique philosophical method.

Existence

Method: Orders of Magnitude

My interpretation of the order of magnitude comes mainly from Gaston 
Bachelard and Gilbert Simondon. The order of magnitude has been a 
method well known in the epistemology of science. Simondon’s approach 
seems to be influenced very much by Bachelard, though Simondon wanted 
to employ it for the analysis of technologies rather than science. This 
method of analysis, according to the orders of magnitude, is the central 
method of this book; however, the method of analysis also distinguishes 
itself from those of Bachelard and Simondon. For Bachelard, the order of 
magnitude is also a means of departing from the Cartesian subject of ob-
servation, which favors an absolute localization and permanent individual-
ity.57 The Cartesian subject sees from one perspective and one reality: the 
extension. The orders of magnitude allow us to observe different modes of 
existence of things. Bachelard defines the order of magnitude as follows:

At the school of science, one learns to think in agreement with the 
order of magnitude of the phenomenon being studied. . . . This 
order of magnitude can be considered a first level of verification. 
In itself, it may often appear as sufficient proof. Not only does it 
justify a method, but as absurd as the atmosphere that surrounds 
it, it appears as the sign of an existence, a decisive mark of the 
ontological faith of the physician, and it is even more striking as 
the imprecision of the being outlined is larger.58

The order of magnitude also designates an approximation or impreci-
sion, meaning that it is impossible to fully analyze the world with absolute 



30 INTRODUCTION

precision; rather, one may do so only relatively. This isn’t only a result of 
the influence of Heisenberg’s principle of uncertainty but also because the 
orders of magnitude may give us different bodies of knowledge that ap-
pear to be exclusive to one other. A certain order of granularity is a selected 
reality. The level of abstraction is an engineering method whereby com-
plexities are reduced into understandable terms: it starts from a problem 
and divides it according to different abstractions. The order of magnitude 
divides the question into different realities as mediated to the observer by 
instruments. To analyze the existence of the objects under observation, 
the observer needs instruments that are specific to an order of magnitude. 
For example, because of the wave– particle duality of light, we can reach 
different conclusions with different apparatuses of observation. This is the 
core idea of Bachelard’s concept of phenomenotechnics. For each order of 
magnitude, we cannot penetrate fully into the object, but we should rather 
ask, what can we neglect?— for “that which we can neglect, we should 
neglect.”59

For Simondon, the order of granularity is also a method that allows re-
fined studies into the different modes of existence of technical objects, 
but also into the different layers of inventions. For example, we can ap-
proach them in terms of technicity, aesthetics, or perception. In Du mode 
d’existence des objets techniques, Simondon approaches technical objects 
through the progress of the concretization of causal relations and the popu-
lation of technical knowledge; in Imagination et invention, he approaches 
them through images and imagination, looking at industrial products in 
terms of their external, middle, and internal layers: the external layer being 
a manifestation of the object in its outer world, the middle layer being 
semitechnic and semilinguistic, and the internal layer being purely techni-
cal.60 A nuanced difference that we can observe between Simondon and 
Bachelard is that, for Simondon, the technical apparatus– instrument is 
not only the medium that allows us to observe different levels of depth of 
a phenomenon but also a tool that bridges two different orders of magni-
tude. This is also a second notable difference from Floridi’s use of levels 
of abstraction, because a level of abstraction is an analytic tool, but not 
a synthetic one. As an illustration of what is meant by a synthetic tool, 
Simondon proposes that the alienation of industrialization arises from the 
synthesis of two orders, those of microtechnics and macrotechnics. For 
artisan objects, this mobilization and unification was not possible but only 
takes place with the appearance of industrial technical objects.61



 INTRODUCTION 31

In this role of mediation by the instrument, we may find a resolution 
amounting to a jump that traverses different orders of magnitude. In other 
words, the material construction acts as “information” that triggers the reso-
lution of tensions between two different orders of magnitude and conse-
quently changes the whole structure. The jump that accompanies it is also 
a restructuralization that we can call transduction, following Simondon. 
This also allows us to develop a general philosophical method that creates 
coherence between different orders of magnitude and systematically con-
struct a plane of consistency (in Deleuze’s terms). Kant’s famous antino-
mies could be seen as attempts to set up two extreme orders of magnitude 
regarding the same object of inquiry. For example, in the first antinomy, 
we read the thesis “The world has a beginning in time and is also enclosed 
within bounds as regards space,” followed by the antithesis “The world 
has no beginning and no bounds in space, but is infinite as regards both 
time and space.”62 We can see that the first order concerns physics and the 
second order concerns intuition. The resolution of these two extreme or-
ders gives Kant a philosophical method and the motivation to systemati-
cally develop a coherent theory. Though Floridi also related his method to 
Kant’s antinomies, here I want to place a greater emphasis on resolution.

Our method largely bases itself on this approach toward different or-
ders of magnitude and aims to produce a system of thoughts that bridges 
different orders of magnitude through developing a theory of relations. 
Philosophical concepts can be seen as inventions that try to overcome the 
incompatibilities or even indifferences between two orders. Hence phi-
losophy remains technical in this project. But a philosopher is different 
from a technician. Bachelard noted,

Finally the engineer is not an artist who creates and signs a work 
full of personality, he is a geometer, guardian of rational methods, 
veritable representative of the technical society of his epoch. He 
is, like the physician, going down the narrow road of approximate 
realizations. He sees a precise end.63

Philosophers search for relativities such that this rationality is viewed not 
as an absolute method but as a relative method. On one hand, this destabi-
lizes the rational method, but on the other hand, it connects it to another 
order of magnitude. In this book, we approach digital objects through dif-
ferent orders of magnitude. But this is by no means an attempt to construct 



32 INTRODUCTION

a precise system of knowledge; rather, it seeks to set up a line of thought, 
incorporating both technical and philosophical thinking, that bridges the 
different realities of a digital object. What underlies this method of orders 
of magnitude is the understanding of relations— because relations can 
be extended from one system to another, from one order of magnitude 
to another. This also reflects the consistency between our method and 
philosophical thought. Relation is by no means monism; rather, it gives 
us an “immanent pluralism,” and corresponding to this horizontal axis 
is the vertical axis of seeing, of theoria.64 If technicians understand struc-
ture as the source of relations, then as Bachelard said, the “metaphysician 
would understand the best how the relations determine the structure.”65 
The order of magnitude becomes a general method of this book. It also 
underscores the novelty of philosophical thoughts and suggests how far 
philosophical thinking can transcend a system that imprisons it through 
connecting the orders of magnitude already integral to the system.

Ontogenesis: Ontologies versus Ontology

There are different spectrums of orders of magnitude, which could make 
possible some original investigations. For example, we can approach from 
the first set of orders of magnitude: this would be the spectrum running 
from the order of microphysics to that of representation on- screen. A 
second set of orders of magnitude is presented by the technical specifi-
cations of the semantic web architecture. The third spectrum would run 
from code to phenomenon. We choose the third spectrum and approach 
from the perspective of data, because it is this that forms the intermedi-
ary between calculation and human experience. Hence it will be the order 
that allows us to address and analyze both the upper and lower levels of 
the existence of digital objects. A question that might be posed of the 
undertaking in this book is why it is concerned with the existence rather 
than modes of existence, the term used by Simondon as well as by Étienne 
Souriau (Les différents modes d’existence, 2009/2012), and also by Bruno 
Latour in his recent book Enquête sur les modes d’existence (2012). Indeed, 
for some readers, the different orders of magnitude or different levels of 
reality of digital objects that I seek to elucidate might seem synonymous 
with, or even better described by, the term modes of existence. However, I 
make this regression (in the best sense of this word) from mode of existence 



 INTRODUCTION 33

back to existence because I would like to develop a project that cares not 
only about the description of the modes of existence of digital objects but 
even more about their potentials and problematics. A project concerned 
with the existence of digital objects wants to rearticulate the positions of 
both objects and humans in the technical system in favor of an individua-
tion proper to humans and objects. In other words, underlying this project 
is a political agenda of individuation.

Concerning existence, we can articulate two orders of magnitude: on-
tologies and Ontology. Ontology comes from the Greek words on and 
logos. On is the present participle of einai, meaning “to be.” Logos comes 
from legein, meaning “to talk about,” or as Heidegger says, “to lay down in 
front of.” One of the central themes of this book (especially in chapter 2) 
will be the revealing of the tension between ontologies as used in compu-
tation and formal ontology and what Heidegger calls fundamental ontol-
ogy (throughout the book, we use Ontology with a capital O to refer to the 
latter and ontologies to refer to the conceptualization used in information 
science). Ontologies, which we will see as lying at the core of the con-
struction of the digital object, are criticized by Heidegger as a metaphysi-
cal oblivion of existence. For Heidegger, metaphysics has left the question 
of Being unquestioned, while only paying attention to ontologies. This 
forgetting, as a fault, also implies the problematic development of mod-
ern technologies, because modern technoscience, which, according to 
Heidegger, takes the world as a picture that one can grasp and describe 
in a controllable manner (ontologies), leads toward danger. Heidegger 
also suggested that a shift from technics to technologies took place in the 
eighteenth century, foregrounded by the beginning of modern physical 
science in the seventeenth century. This shift also implies a planetary 
project of development— modernization. The essence of technology is 
nothing technological but what he calls the Enframing (Gestell). Gestell 
comes from the verb stellen, meaning “to put,” “to set something there.” 
In this setting- there, nature, including the human, becomes the standing 
reserve (Bestand).66 In our inquiry, we use the word technical more often 
than technological to denote a broader conception of technics as well as 
the possibility of the transformation of negative technologies into some-
thing favorable.

However, we still find ontologies to be the most important constitu-
ents of digital objects. Ontologies are what make digital objects objects 



34 INTRODUCTION

rather than merely data. Ontologies are productive, like Kant’s categories. 
Categories capture data and organize them in an order that unifies the 
manifold elements of their presence. Analogically, ontologies give a ma-
chine the ability to recognize and operate the object as a unity instead of as 
random data. In chapter 1, we will see two movements now taking place in 
parallel in the digital milieu around the question of objects. On one hand, 
we have the objectification of data, on the other, the dataification of objects. 
Ontologies are still going to be significant for this stage of the develop-
ment of the Web and other applications. These ontologies also become 
the source of relations. That is to say, they are not merely representations. 
These relations multiply and intensify, especially when the objects are put 
in broader milieux. Information technologies, as we will see in chapters 3 
and 4, can be understood as technologies of relations. This poses another 
question: if we are already in a technical system, how can we address the 
critique of Heidegger, and where will we find a place for the fundamental 
Ontology?

Ontologies and Ontology are understood in this book as two different 
orders of magnitude. These two terms demand a third term to resolve their 
tensions, which we will call, following Simondon, ontogenesis, while the 
third term that we have for the resolution of the tensions between being 
and Being is relations. Ontogenesis means the origination and develop-
ment of an individual organism; it concerns less what an individual is and 
more how it individuates in itself and how it does so in the collective. For 
Simondon, between different orders, there exist a ground and forms. We 
can probably say that Ontology is the ground and ontologies are forms. 
Forms cannot exist on their own, because forms didn’t create themselves, 
so that it is rather the ground that carries forms. But this doesn’t mean 
that forms are opposite to ground, nor are forms less important than the 
ground. An example Simondon gives is that life is the ground and thoughts 
are forms. There wouldn’t be a thinking being without life.67 Simondon 
also found there to be an analogy between technical objects and living 
being. The forms of technical objects need a milieu that is an ensemble 
of other technical objects and the environment. Indeed, if we want to 
consider the technical system, and if we understand living beings— here 
humans— as part of the technical system, then this form and ground must 
be understood otherwise and here underlie the political agenda of a proj-
ect concerned with existence.



 INTRODUCTION 35

Reticulation and Convergence

In the writing of Simondon, we can probably say that the mode of exis-
tence of a technical object is in its different modes of reticulation, which 
range from the internal structures organizing different technical elements, 
individuals, and ensembles to the wider milieu within which a techni-
cal object resides. For Simondon, the problem of alienation comes from 
a misunderstanding or lack of understanding of technologies, hence the 
misconstruction of a technical ensemble. And this misunderstanding 
leads to the rupture between ground and forms. Simondon identified that, 
first, alienation happens when the associated milieu can no longer regu-
late forms. Forms affect ground in that the ground is not able to maintain 
a recurrent causality with forms. This recurrent causality is the associ-
ated milieu. Second, the bifurcation of knowledge has produced a situa-
tion in which culture is detached from technics. In chapter 4, we revisit 
Simondon’s speculative history of technics, where magic is depicted as 
having bifurcated into technical objects and religions, with technics then 
bifurcating further into science (theoretical) and technology (practical). 
For Simondon, it is necessary to develop philosophical thoughts that miti-
gate the opposition between culture and technics and invent a techno-
logical humanism against alienation. Philosophical thought has the task 
of creating convergences after bifurcations have taken place.

For our inquiry, the milieu that we are in is no longer an ensemble con-
sisting of machines and operators, as Simondon perceived it in his time; 
it is rather an information system composed of multiple networks of ob-
jects and users. If alienation can be analyzed through the malfunctioning 
of the associated milieu, this means that social normativity can be ana-
lyzed technically, because it is already inscribed in the technical system. If 
we want to solve the problem of alienation due to industrialization, then 
the task will be to analyze the technical system, and this will demand a 
rigorous method. This book understands the technical system consist-
ing of humans and objects as a unity of relations and proposes to think of 
the organizations of relations according to different orders. To approach 
a technical system, and to put its associated milieu in the right position, 
we should thus start from existential relations and then move to discursive 
relations to coordinate the ground and forms. This reading of Simondon 
and the problem of alienation is also influenced by Heidegger’s critique of 
the essence of technology.



36 INTRODUCTION

The agenda of convergence is also central in the thought of the late 
Heidegger, especially in his 1950 essay “The Thing,” where he proposes to 
understand a thing in a fourfold manner, the four dimensions being God, 
heaven, earth, and the mortal. Heidegger observes that although it seems 
that technological development has greatly reduced the distance between 
things, for example, through television, radio, and telephone, in fact the 
distance between humans and things has only been enlarged. Heidegger 
proposes to go back to the meaning of the word thing (Ding) and its re-
lation to the old German word dinc, meaning “to gather.” The thing (the 
jar in Heidegger’s example) in this case becomes a site that gathers the 
fourfolds. Users of social networks know that a digital object, for example, 
a Facebook image, serves the function of gathering comments and discus-
sions from other users. Heidegger would have doubted such conception, 
just like he has questioned the telephone and the television. To follow 
Heidegger, the question that we want to pose here is, how can we deal with 
the question of convergence, when we are already able to create networks? 
As we have already noted, Simondon wasn’t able to provide an answer to 
this question, because in his time, it was still impossible for an individual 
to create a network. Meanwhile, Heidegger’s return to the fourfold nature 
of the thing as well as Simondon’s understanding of networks present us 
the possibility of developing an interobjective thinking (as we explain in 
chapter 4), which could become an analytic tool for understanding the 
systemization of technologies.

The aim here is to go back to digital objects themselves and to think 
about other forms of convergences and reticulations in relation to experi-
ence. In particular, this is the task of Part III of this book. From Part I to 
Part II, there is a movement from objects to systems, from ontologies to 
Ontology, finally reaching resolution in relations and ontogenesis; subse-
quently, in Part III, there is a return to digital objects, but this time we 
confront the relation between logic and object, a different order of magni-
tude. For the ultimate aim in constructing digital objects is to implement 
a logical language traversing the Web. At the beginning of the twentieth 
century, Husserl already saw the problem of formal logic as one of the 
manifestations of the crisis of European science. Husserl understood for-
mal logic as a technicization (Technisierung), through which we become 
no longer able to understand the origin of logic, which is experience. For 
Husserl, we can find a stronger notion of judgment in experience rather 
than symbolic logic. In contrast, he proposed an intentional logic (as op-



 INTRODUCTION 37

posed to extensional logic) to reestablish the foundation of logic. Today 
there is still much discussion of Husserl and formal ontology among ana-
lytic philosophers, but Husserl’s strong proposal to overcome formal logic 
is seldom discussed. Nonetheless, one can ask, as this book does, can this 
Husserlian imperative be retrieved and rendered practical in thinking 
about digital objects? This doesn’t necessarily mean that we would have 
to give up formal logic; rather, we’d have to realize the Husserlian concept 
on a computational level, as Brian Cantwell Smith has brilliantly done.

Heidegger’s critique went much further than Husserl’s. The techniza-
tion of the world is the manifestation of a metaphysical mistake. In what 
Heidegger calls the essence of technologies, Enframing, forms come to the 
fore and become the force of industrialization. In this process, time only 
serves as the synchronization of forms. For example, people tend more and 
more to rely on machines to organize their lives and give to mobile phones 
the responsibility for synchronizing their meetings, eating, sleeping, and 
so on. In this synchronization, there is a destruction of the unity of time, 
which Heidegger calls care. Everyday distraction will be amplified by tech-
nological development. This is not only the problem of the manifestation 
of technology but is, at bottom, the problem of thinking, a thinking that 
privileges forms: logic. Logic poses a question to thinking, because logic 
moves from one concept to another according to rigid relations. The in-
vention of cybernetics, as Heidegger saw, is the logicization of language. 
Language once understood as disclosure loses its temporal ecstasy. Its func-
tion as a revelation of being starts to disappear. Language is deprived of its 
ground by its forms. Philosophers also cease to think: as Heidegger said, 
“one no longer thinks; one occupies oneself with philosophy.”68 Heidegger, 
in Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, wanted to retrieve the foundation of 
metaphysics through the notion of transcendental imagination as the fac-
ulty of transcendental apprehension— whereas in edition B of the Critique 
of Pure Reason, Kant had removed this role for the transcendental imagina-
tion and made it just one of the functions, instead assigning the power to 
schematism, that is, to the categories and logic. Heidegger wanted to reread 
Kant as a critique of neo- Kantians and positivists, who believe that logic 
should be made the ground of metaphysics. For Heidegger, metaphysics is 
completed by cybernetics: we live at the end of time.

Now if the information system, the semantic web in particular, is striving 
for a language of logic, what is meant by this? When everything is becom-
ing data and being represented in logical statements, and then automated 



38 INTRODUCTION

by algorithms, isn’t this a higher mode of Enframing? This pre sents an im-
passe to either arguing for Heidegger or against him. We could understand 
these differences in terms of orders of magnitude. If time is the foundation 
of metaphysics, then couldn’t even technics be understood as time? This 
is also the concern of Bernard Stiegler, who has proposed to understand 
technics in terms of time or, more precisely, tertiary retention. Much of this 
book is influenced by Stiegler’s perspective, which served as the inspiration 
to think about time in a technical system. Indeed, we can identify different 
orders of magnitude of time in a technical system: point- based clock time, 
intervals and periods, topological time, which we discuss in detail in chap-
ter 4. Based on Stiegler’s tertiary retention, we can also identify a tertiary 
protention made possible by algorithms. In fact, thanks to these tensions 
set up by Husserl and Heidegger, we are able to rethink logic and digital 
objects. We can ask whether logic is only one set of these relations, in which 
case, should we not be able to think new types of relations and new ways to 
organize relations? Could a Husserlian critique and organization of digital 
objects be possible? Can we find a transductive logic in a technical system 
that may point us to new forms of individuation (of objects and of Dasein)?

How, then, is a relational thinking, already realized in technics, able to 
negate itself, to redirect itself toward another possibility? Isn’t this what 
Heidegger said about the danger of technology when he quoted the poem 
of Hölderlin?

Wo aber Gefahr ist, wächst
Das Rettende auch

But where danger is, grows
The saving power also69

We have seen that a similar logic was explored by Lyotard in his project 
of the postmodern as well as in the critique of the substance– accident 
conception of objects. The new possibilities lie in the grasp of a rigor-
ous way of thinking and a sensibility toward technological development. 
Hence the analysis of the genesis of digital objects in terms of relations, 
and an appreciation of the reality of technical progress as the evolution of 
interobjectivities, attempts to discover a new sensibility for being with ob-
jects enabled by technologies; and it is there that one may find the possibil-
ity of a transformation through the reevaluation of the associated milieux 
in both philosophical and technical terms.



 INTRODUCTION 39

Structure of the Book

This book aims to develop a philosophical investigation of digital ob-
jects by studying the development of markup languages and ontologies 
through Heidegger’s and Simondon’s theories of objects. Situating itself 
among different contemporary theories, such as object- oriented philoso-
phy (and even speculative realism), philosophy of information, and digital 
philosophy, this book aims to provide a relational thinking for the study 
of objects and also to translate it into critical questions for the design of 
technical artifacts. Though this may seem an ambitious project, it should 
be considered a contribution to a greater framework of the study of the 
digital in the future, which will demand more and more synthesis between 
theory and practice. To carry out this study, I have mapped the life cycle of 
digital objects, as shown in Figure 6. The book is divided into three parts: 
Part I, “Objects,” Part II, “Relations,” and Part III, “Logics.” Each part con-
sists of two chapters.

40 INTRODUCTION

Chapter 1 outlines the genesis of digital objects by looking at the his-
tory of markup languages, from GML to HTML, XML and the Web on-
tologies proposed by the semantic web movement. This chapter reads this 
technical history in parallel with Simondon’s analysis of technical objects, 
that is, by seeing it as a process of concretization and individualization. 
Individualization is presented as a method for analyzing the evolution of 
the internal dynamics of technical objects rather than understanding them 
in terms of social– economic constructions. The chapter further asks if it is 
also possible to understand the individuation of digital objects. This ques-
tion wants to push the inquiry further because Simondon didn’t use the 
word individuation for technical objects, whereas I propose that thinking 
through the individuation of technical objects is a way to render explicit 
Simondon’s project on technical objects, which starts with a discourse 
against alienation. This imperative from Simondon is present throughout 
this book, and the notion of individuation as well as that of transduction 
will be picked up from time to time.

Chapter 2 starts by setting up two oppositions: (1) ontologies versus 
Ontology and (2) semantics versus syntax. It surveys different notions of 
ontologies and objects in computation, through the work of Tom Gruber 
and the research on formal ontology by Barry Smith, Nicola Guarino, Boris 
Hennig, and so on. Formal ontology is a concept proposed by Edmund 
Husserl in his Logical Investigation and later in Formal and Transcendental 
Logic and is further taken up by contemporary philosophers who work on 
information systems. Recognizing that this reference to Husserl in fact 
ignores the fundamental aim of Husserl’s project, which is a phenom-
enological approach to logic, this chapter proposes to look at the notion 
of object and ontology from a fresh perspective. The chapter singles out 
the work of the computer and cognitive scientist Brian Cantwell Smith, 
whose book On the Origin of Objects consisted of a strong critique of the 
dogmatic approach of computer scientists toward ontologies and a pro-
posal for a foundational metaphysics for computation. We will then find 
that in fact, Cantwell Smith’s approach is very close to Husserl’s, especially 
those aspects of the latter that have been ignored by formal ontologists. 
The chapter then introduces another conception of ontology, Heidegger’s 
fundamental ontology, or Ontology. This chapter ends by suggesting that 
these oppositions may be resolved through a third term, that is, by (a 
theory of) relations.

Part II aims to develop a materialist theory of relations. Chapter 3 



 INTRODUCTION 41

sketches such a theory through a reading of the concept of relation in the 
history of philosophy, especially in the work of Aristotle, Leibniz, Hume, 
Heidegger, and Bertrand Russell. It suggests that we can understand rela-
tions in two forms, as discursive relations and as existential relations. This 
chapter further illustrates how discursive relations are implemented in 
computation, first through relational calculus, then through the relational 
database proposed by Edgar Codd, and finally in the current development 
of the semantic web. It suggests that to understand the individuation of 
digital objects, it is necessary to overcome the tension between discourse 
relations and existential relations, and that the resolution of this tension 
leads to a discourse of a technical system.

Chapter 4 continues by taking up the notion of the technical system, 
which centers on the concept of interobjectivity. Phenomenological re-
search, as well as the phenomenological sociology of Alfred Schutz, has 
placed the focus on intersubjectivity, without paying much attention to 
interobjectivity. By interobjectivity, I mean relations that can be material-
ized as discursive relations, for example, physical contacts in mechanics, 
formal logic, and so on. The suggestion is that the concept of interobjectiv-
ity instead of intersubjectivity can be further developed to understand the 
evolution of technics. Specifically, I look at the emergence of information 
systems, the Web, and the discourse on technical systems of Jacque Ellul 
(who was inspired by Simondon) and historian Bertrand Gille, showing 
that the notion of milieu has been slowly replaced by the notion of system.

The chapter proposes to read Heidegger’s 1950 essay Das Ding as a pro-
posal to reconstruct interobjectivities, which he calls the fourfolds (das 
Geviert), to bring human and world together in light of the supposed fact 
that technologies (TV, radio, telephone) have shortened the distance be-
tween humans. It also looks at the speculative history of Simondon, which 
understands the history of technics as a process of bifurcation from magic, 
subsequently followed by constant bifurcation, and his proposal for mo-
bilizing philosophical thinking to create a convergence, one that would 
reunite man and world. Common to both of them is the advocation that 
we go back to things (Heidegger) and technical objects (Simondon) to 
produce a convergence between humans and world. This idea might im-
mediately give rise to the objection that we surely already live in a net-
worked society, in which the distances between things and humans are 
diminishing, especially in light of a dominant trend in social sciences that 
sees objects as acquiring new degrees of agency in contemporary culture. 



42 INTRODUCTION

However, as Heidegger argued, these networks are not really producing 
convergence but rather distances.

If we want to think within the technical reality of systems, then in 
what ways can one further develop the notion of digital objects? Though 
Simondon cannot give us a direct answer, his efforts to think about the de-
velopment of technical objects and to conceive a technological humanism 
remain central to Part III, which takes up this question with a direction 
of inquiry that takes a sharp turn from that of the previous chapters. If 
the previous chapters aim at developing a speculative philosophy of digital 
objects, the last two chapters deal with human experience and metaphys-
ics, which I believe are fundamental to Heidegger’s and Simondon’s dis-
courses on modern technologies. Hence Part III, as the reader will see, 
sets out alternative histories of logic, which are also seen as the foundation 
of digital objects as well as computation. These two chapters revisit the 
debates around logic that took place at the beginning of the twentieth cen-
tury, notably in the works of Husserl and Heidegger, to suggest another 
way of looking at convergence by thinking about digital objects differently.

Chapter 5 considers some recent debates (Patrick Hayles and Tim 
Berners- Lee) on logic, especially concerning meaning and reference on the 
Web, employing the theories of Frege, Putnam, Kripke, and Davidson; it 
proposes an alternative way to understand this issue by revisiting Husserl’s 
critique of logic (which is rarely mentioned today among computer scien-
tists and computational theorists, who employ his formal ontologies) and 
Simondon’s transductive logic. This debate could be characterized as the 
pitting of an intentional logic against an extensional logic, a transductive 
logic against classical logic. The former operates on intentional acts and 
horizons of meaning; the latter operates on symbols and rules. This chap-
ter aims to propose that it is possible to develop further the critique of 
Husserl by its application to the Web, to produce a new convergence that 
is at the same time cognitive and collective. We can further ask the ques-
tion, to what kind of convergence should this lead? Certainly this would be 
something along the lines of the collective intelligence proposed by Pierre 
Lévy or, more precisely, the symbiosis prefigured by Lickleider or the 
autopoiesis proposed by Varela and Maturana. But can we consider this 
as simultaneously a progression in both technology and the humanities? 
In parallel, the reader can also read it as an attempt to reinvent Husserl’s 
phenomenological method by undermining the pure ego as well as a rec-
onciliation between Husserl and Simondon in the spirit of Deleuze.



 INTRODUCTION 43

Chapter 6 problematizes this “collective intelligence” by going back to 
the debate between Heidegger and the neo- Kantians on logic, because this 
debate concerns the foundation of metaphysics. Heidegger thinks that 
when, in the second edition of Critique of Pure Reason, Kant deleted the 
section on transcendental imagination, he was taking a step backward, 
shrinking away from something crucial. Heidegger’s task was to show 
that transcendental imagination thus understood as time instead of logic 
should be the foundation of metaphysics. The chapter reconciles this de-
bate by proposing the concept of tertiary protentions as a new synthesis of 
time that comes out of a reading of Husserl, Stiegler, and Deleuze. The dis-
cussion of tertiary protentions leads to an investigation of the algorithm 
and the milieux of digital objects. What exactly is an algorithm? A conven-
tional example is that it functions like a recipe. I propose that, instead, one 
should approach it from the concept of recursion, by tracing the history of 
mathematics of Dedekind, Skolem, Gödel, and Turing, which allow us to 
think of a machine hermeneutics. The intensification of the algorithm in 
the process of thinking leads to the problem of the destruction of the as-
sociated milieu as described by Simondon, whereby the internal dynamics 
of the technical object cannot be maintained. This chapter ends by sug-
gesting a return to reflection on the construction of the associated milieux 
beyond technical systems.

The Genesis of Digital Objects

Digital Objects and Their Milieux

We are currently living in a digital milieu; we Facebook, we blog, we Flickr, 
we YouTube, and we Vimeo. Nouns and brands have become verbs, even 
forms of life. The speed of technological innovation, the ubiquity of the 
latest and greatest versions of electronic devices, the promise of an eman-
cipative technology or media, financial investment based on the digitiza-
tion of human relations, and so on— they all constitute a seeing that is 
never in the present but is rather the projection of a nihilistic not- yet. This 
mode of existence is not what Martin Heidegger calls “temporal ecstasy,” 
in which one nonetheless grounds oneself in an authentic time; it is rather 
a hyper- ecstasy that celebrates speed while simultaneously being haunted 
by the anxiety of not being there, not being able to situate itself within 
the grand rhetoric of the technology evangelists. I call this experience tech-
nological ecstasy, a way of becoming that has no clear idea of its direction 
yet is characterized by acceleration and adventure. The constant passing 
of the “new” constitutes an indifference toward rhythm, which, in turn, le-
gitimatizes a natural seeing of what is there and what is expected. The 
word new denotes the passing away of the old and the differentiation of 
the world in its projection, driven by a gigantic force of movement.

The understanding of technology is no longer a matter of a cultural cri-
tique of technology. Indeed, the traditional exclusion of technology from 
culture must be brought into question. To resolve this conflict we must 
employ a new organon, or a new series of philosophical propositions. Any 
proposed theory would initially need to identify the reality with which 
it is concerned. To understand the “real,” we must compare it with what 
is commonly understood as virtual. The idea of the virtual, which was 
popular some years ago as a descriptor of certain kinds of community and 
interaction dependent on digital media, such as online forums and cyber-
sex, has since receded into the background, as you can no longer say today 



48 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

that someone using Facebook or Second Life is living within a virtual 
world (considering that he is interacting with his real friends and engaging 
in activities like providing his credit card number and personal informa-
tion to order a Swedish Visa online).1 The introduction and convergence 
of technologies like Bluetooth, Wi- Fi, and GPS allow for more accurate 
contextual and geographical detections, leading us into the REAL. How 
can we address this digital milieu? It is another world, a strange world, 
one that is simultaneously artificial and natural. It is as complicated as 
what we used to refer to as the “real world,” and more important, it is a 
world we are already in.

Our investigation will focus on digital objects to better understand 
where the current transformation process is heading and to develop an 
appropriate method for its investigation. The term digital object remains 
ambiguous here, because the vast quantity of digital objects are compa-
rable in breadth and diversity to the vast array of animal species. Instead 
of addressing all of them, I will be focusing mainly on data and metadata, 
which embody the objects with which we are interacting, and with which 
machines are simultaneously operating. The first questions we will ask at 
this point are, does hardware count? What about algorithms? Although 
I am tempted to include all objects related to computation as digital ob-
jects, some restriction of scope is necessary to allow me to focus an equal 
amount of attention on the digital aspect of the digital object. We have 
a tendency to call everything an object, to generalize all computational 
components as digital objects. However, this approach appears to be 
rather problematic, because individual objects would lose their singulari-
ties. The same issue applies when object- oriented philosophers give the 
general name of “objects” to all entities apart from the human being. Thus 
it is necessary here to suspend any common understandings or interpreta-
tions of “objects.” It is true that we are able to reduce all operations to 0 
and 1 binaries, and even further down to the activities of electrons and 
atoms; however, this only gives us a particular order of reality in terms of 
what digital means, and one that has little to do with the direct experi-
ence of the users. Digital, in the context of this book, has a specific orienta-
tion toward the automation of data processing. Data directly intervenes 
throughout our human experiences in a double sense. When we look at 
the term data, we generally do not recognize its Latin origin, as the plural 
form of datum, meaning “[a thing] given.” The French word for data, don-
née (“given,” from donner, “to give”), retains the Latin sense exactly. If data 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 49

are the “things” given, then what is it that gives data? Aside from having 
the speculation in mind that this givenness comes from God, we should 
recognize that since 1946, the word data has had an additional meaning: 
“transmittable and storable computer information.”2 This second under-
standing of data suggests the need for a reconsideration of the philosophy 
of objects, because it can no longer be assumed to refer entirely to sense 
and noetic data. Instead, one should recognize this translation as taking on 
a material form and consider how this materiality constitutes a new form 
of “givenness.” The significance of the recent development of data process-
ing, that which we have since proclaimed as the digital, demonstrates the 
extension of data— exchanging capabilities beyond individual computers 
such that we can process large amounts of data by establishing connec-
tions to form data networks that extend from platforms to platforms, and 
from databases to databases, constituting a technical system.

The next question we face is, how should digital objects be conceptu-
alized? According to the common view of scientists and/or mathemati-
cians, we can have a superset of objects, inside which we can find a subset 
of objects called technical objects alongside natural objects, as theorized 
by Gilbert Simondon. It is also understood that within this subset, we 
can find a further subset of objects called digital objects. It is possible 
that there may be more subsets than those which have previously been 
accounted for, according to different schemes of classification. Instead 
of following this classification, however, I would like to propose a split-
ting between technical objects and digital objects. Digital objects are new 
forms of industrial objects. If the “new” demands a new understanding, 
then addressing this may begin with asking where this “new” came from. 
The new can only manifest relative to the old, either as a continuation or 
as a break or rupture. As Simondon would say, inventions always attempt 
to remove the obstacles and resume a general continuity of development.3 
The analyses throughout this book will be primarily concerned with a se-
ries of incompatibilities created by the reverberations of the new, those 
that demand we direct our attention toward the genesis of objects within 
a historical perspective. In this chapter, I describe the genesis of digital 
objects by situating them within the history of computing and introduce 
the analysis of Gilbert Simondon. I compare the relation between data 
and objects in the new setting and how this account of their genesis can 
contribute to our understanding of computational technologies.



50 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

The Double Movement of Object and Data

The methods through which objects become translated into data are 
not new. They follow the logic of digitization after the emergence of the 
modern computational machines, namely, everything can virtually be 
represented in digital formats. There are two dominant forms of digitiza-
tion: the first follows the system of mapping or mimesis (for example, the 
production of digital images, digital video, etc., which are visually and re-
petitively distributed throughout the physical world), whereas the second 
takes place by means of attaching tags to objects and coding them into 
the digital milieu (by means of this digital extension, the object then ob-
tains an identity with a unique code and/or set of references). The second 
movement of objectification of data comes a bit later. I call the first pro-
cess the objectification of data and the second process the dataification of 
objects. In saying this, I don’t mean to say that these things are not objects 
before they are objectified by metadata schemes but rather that they are 
formalized as objects through human agency and then recognized as ob-
jects by computers; or, in the spirit of Heidegger, they are things (Ding) 
before they become objects (Gegenstand). This way of representing ob-
jects is widely known as knowledge representation. Knowledge represen-
tation has been a key topic within artificial intelligence (AI) for decades, 
and it is steadily increasing in importance again following the failure of a 
number of large- scale projects4 now under the name “semantic web.” This 
objectification process has two very significant implications: (1) it breaks 
away from the hyperlink- based Web to become the object- based Web and 
(2) it signifies a more significant role for the machine, not as an input– 
output device, but also as a partially “thinking machine.” I want to ap-
proach this development in terms of two technical questions, which are 
simultaneously philosophical questions: the question of objectification 
and the question of intentionality and experience pertaining to thinking 
machines. Indeed, this book is the result of an endeavor to read the his-
tory of philosophy through digital objects and at the same time to read 
the history of digital objects through philosophy. Finally, we will see that 
computation is no less philosophical than philosophy, and philosophy is 
no less technological. To pursue this path, we need to unfold the technical 
details of the emergence of digital objects before proceeding to a more 
philosophically oriented analysis.

My reading of the movement of the Web sees it as the inauguration of 
a process of the objectification of data, not only for humans but also for 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 51

machines. It is in this sense that the founder of the Web, Tim Berners- Lee, 
could envisage the emergence of a “global mind” shared between humans 
and machines and supported by the Web.5 In 1989, when he proposed the 
World Wide Web at CERN (the Swiss- based high- energy physics lab), his 
model was largely influenced by the technology visionary Ted Nelson, al-
though with some fundamental differences. For Nelson, the concept of 
a digital object was impossible, as he saw the network from the point of 
view of literature. Nelson’s idea of hypertext was to realize nonsequential 
writing6 through which the interconnectivity of literature can be unfolded 
in different temporalities. Every hypertext would imply a jump from one 
spatiotemporal setting to another, while through these trajectories, a net-
work can be understood as a form of nonsequential writing.

Nelson’s vision was restricted by its dependence on the limited concept 
of text and writing, whereas Berners- Lee’s focus on the Web in the 1990s 
was primarily concerned with hypertext and the hyperlink. The striking 
difference between Berners- Lee’s model and Nelson’s model reflects their 
fundamental motivations. Nelson’s vision of the Web was tied to a pay-
ment system, so that the payment to the authors of the literature could 
be managed by links. This motivation coincidentally led to a completely 
different architecture of links from that of Berners- Lee’s model. Nelson 
proposed, in his Xanadu project, a two- way link system, while we know 
that the early Web was a one- way- link- based system on <a href>, which 
specifies the URL to be loaded when the link is clicked. Today these two- 
way links have been realized, not as Web architecture, but as overlays, such 
as blog comments, trackbacks, and so on. Berners- Lee’s vision comes from 
the internal sharing of documents within CERN, so that different versions 
of documents could be linked and archived in a way that would minimize 
the loss of information in a “final report.” Nelson was to some extent justi-
fied when he criticized the Web as a file system with one- way links: “to-
day’s one- way hypertext— the World Wide Web— is far too shallow. The 
Xanadu project foresaw world- wide hypertext and has always endeavored 
to create a much deeper system. The Web, however, took over with a very 
shallow structure.”7 But it is not an entirely fair comment, because we must 
also understand that for Berners- Lee, the Web in its evolution has already 
far surpassed this stage of file sharing.

For the Berners- Lee of the 2000s, the vision of the Web has already 
developed beyond the sharing of documents to the collaborative imagina-
tion of minds and machines. This is more or less based on the assumption 



52 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

that the mind perceives objects through representations. Structured meta-
data provide the computer program with the conceptualization of objects. 
The formal definition of metadata is “data about data.” An intuitive ex-
ample is the library search: when a person looks for a book in the library 
catalog, she must submit different information, for example, the name of 
the author, the title of the book, or the ISBN number. This information, 
which is in addition to the content itself (data), is known as metadata. The 
formats within which these data are presented are called metadata schemes. 
We can compare this with Kant’s schemata, as the fusion of the pure con-
cepts or categories that gives rise to phenomena from sense— data. In the 
age of hypertext, online objects are only meaningful to humans, not to 
machines. However, in the age of metadata, online objects are considered 
to be meaningful to both machines and humans.8 Machines understand 
the semantic meaning of objects via the structures given to the metadata. 
This objectification movement is called the semantic web, introduced by 
Tim Berners- Lee in 2001. Berners- Lee argued that “in the future, when the 
metadata languages and engines are more developed, it should also form a 
strong basis for a web of machine understandable information about any-
thing: about the people, things, concepts and ideas.”9

The double movement from object to data, and from data to object, 
will be an ongoing project that will continue to develop over the com-
ing decades. It presents us with new forms of objects, constituting a new 
milieu in need of further reflection. This is the case not only within the 
Web industry but also throughout information science as a whole. If 
we reflect on the early stages of the development of the catalog system 
within library science, we can see that it followed the same technological 
tendencies. The Web (or simply the Internet in general) promotes a mi-
lieu that includes various sectors influenced by a combination of techno-
logical, economic, and political concerns. For example, in library science, 
early cataloging schemes like Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) 
and Angelo- America Cataloging Rules (AACR) grounded a lengthy ef-
fort to address the question of annotation. However, since digitalization 
and Internetization, these schemes have become obsolete and are being 
replaced by ontologies, such as Dublin Core (DC).10 The reason for this 
is twofold: first, MARC and AACR are specific protocols that cannot be 
used outside of their limited field, implying that they cannot effectively 
be integrated into the digital milieu alongside other machines. The sec-
ond reason is that they cannot be read by humans and are thus unable to 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 53

participate in the universal communication of the “global mind.” In other 
words, they do not treat a book as an object as such but rather as mere 
symbolic data. Figure 7, an example of MARC, provides the informational 
data for a given book.

“MARC must die”11 is a familiar slogan commonly expressed among 
library technicians since the early 2000s (a website created by digital li-
brarians is dedicated specifically to this cause). This has also presented a 
crisis regarding the creation of digital objects. Because librarians and tech-
nicians working with digital objects must manage a great magnitude of 
symbols that provide them with hardly any concrete or understandable 
information, they are condemned to be the assistants of machines. This 
has led to one of the most notable phenomena of alienation within the 
digital milieu. The vision of the semantic web, as a means of generating 
new forms of objects that are meaningful to both humans and machines, 
received a lot of appreciation and interest from various communities. The 
genesis of digital objects is hence not the sole effort of Tim Berners- Lee 
and his team in the World Wide Web Consortium but rather a milestone 
achieved via the advancement and development of the computation as a 
result of its long history.

Throughout the following sections, we examine the historical emer-
gence of digital objects by attending to the thoughts and arguments of 
Gilbert Simondon. The importance of introducing Simondon’s thought 
here in this context is that he was not only perhaps the first thinker to pro-
pose a philosophical understanding of technical objects but he also con-
ceived the development of a technological culture to serve as a solution to 
Marx’s critique of alienation. At the very beginning of Du mode d’existence 
des objets techniques, Simondon wrote, “The stronger cause of alienation 
in the contemporary world resides in this misunderstanding (méconnais-
sance) of machine, which is not an alienation caused by machines, but the 
lack of understanding (non- connaissance) of its nature and its essence, be-
cause of its absence from the world of significations and its omission in the

table of values and concepts belonging to culture.”12 Simondon introduced 
a potential approach called mechanology, which would put machines at the 
forefront of general education, proposing that technological knowledge 
should be introduced as part of the educational curriculum, with a status 
equivalent to that of literature.13 Throughout the history of metaphysics 
(which in Heideggerian terms equates to the history of philosophy), from 
as early as Plato to the later theories of Edmund Husserl, a technical object 
was nothing more than a tree in the garden or an apple on the table. What 
interested philosophers was either the idea of and the essence of the objects, 
as manifest in Plato’s idea, Aristotle’s form and matter, Descartes’s extension, 
Leibniz’s monads, Kant’s schematization, Hegel’s dialectics of consciousness, or 
Husserl’s noetic and noematic correlation, or a natural (or organic) and me-
chanical opposition was posed, which consequently subordinates the me-
chanical to the natural. Technological knowledge simply did not achieve 
a formal position within this philosophical tradition, except at the brief 
moment of Diderot and D’Alembert’s encyclopedia, which attempted to 
render technical knowledge transparent to the public. The emergence of 
cybernetics in the early twentieth century, however, stimulated a ruptur-
ing of the philosophical tradition by questioning the border between the 
natural and the artificial. The dynamic of machines cannot be captured 
solely by an eidos. This coincidentally created a demand for a new direc-
tion in philosophical thinking during the mid- twentieth century, from 
which emerged the two very contrasting approaches that are of particular 
interest to us here. On one hand, Martin Heidegger lamented that cyber-
netics marked the overall completion of metaphysics and simultaneously 
the end of philosophy. This caused him to attempt a retrieval qua retreat 
to a new form of thinking. On the other hand, Gilbert Simondon wanted 
to understand technology not as a closure but rather as a process working 
toward the perfection of technical individuals and through a systematic 
understanding of the transformation of the human with the evolution of 
tools to search for a technical disalienation.

Individualization of Technical Objects

We should first address two prominent concepts used by Simondon that 
are often confusing for his readers: individuation and individualization. 
For Simondon, individuation is clearly different from individualization. 
Individualization concerns functions such as somatic specializations and 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 55

psychic schematization. When the term is applied to living beings, it de-
notes the development and division between the psychic and the soma. 
Individuation, alternatively, concerns the genesis and resolution of ten-
sions to arrive at a metastable equilibrium passing by a restructuralization 
of relations.14 Individualization is not opposed at all to individuation; they 
would be better viewed as two separate orders of magnitude of beings. In 
L’individuation à la lumière des notions de forme et d’information (2005), 
Simondon talked about the individuation of physical beings (e.g., crys-
tals), living beings, and the individuation of psychic beings; in Du mode 
d’existence des objets techniques, he mainly talked about “technical individu-
alization” rather than “technical individuation.” Could we also discuss the 
“individuation of the digital object”? Simondon’s hesitations toward this 
leave us with a rather large space of inquiry, allowing us to develop his 
efforts further. To expose these possibilities, it will be necessary for us to 
observe and analyze how Simondon carried out his analysis of technical 
objects.

A technical object is always a product of determination, or even over-
determination. The term overdetermination refers to a process of impos-
ing constraints and conditions so as to maturate the functionalities of the 
technical objects. The maturity of technical objects can then be measured 
by what Simondon calls technicity, which is the degree of concretization 
within the object. Simondon sees the evolution of technical objects as a 
progression from abstract objects to concrete objects. To be concrete en-
tails the convergence and adaptation of the object to itself. For example, 
when a technical object integrates further functions into itself and subse-
quently compromises these functions in a coherent way, it becomes more 
concrete than it was previously; as Simondon wrote, “the unity of tech-
nical object, its individuality, its specificity, are the characters of consis-
tence and convergence of its genesis.”15 Hence we can say that industrial 
technical objects are more concrete than the artisan’s products. Simondon 
argued that the customized products belonging to the artisans are not 
technically essential but that rather they are produced by other essential 
factors, such as external needs— whereas in industry, technical objects 
gain their own coherence. Simondon’s technical objects are therefore also 
industrial objects.

According to Simondon’s classification, there are two forms of techni-
cal object, namely, “element” (or “infra- individual”) and “technical individ-
ual.”16 In comparison with the elements that are simply building blocks, the 



56 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

technical individual has a complete set of functions as well as a mechanism 
that allows it to maintain the internal stability in response to specific exter-
nal disturbances. Simondon defines a technical individual as “one having 
an associated milieu as a sine qua non condition of its functioning.” The 
associated milieu is a means of adaptation, ensuring that the individual is 
“not to be influenced by the external technical and natural environment.”17 
This criterion implies that the object already has the ability to indepen-
dently stand on its own within the constraints that are already set into its 
overdetermination.18 Technical individualization for Simondon depends 
on the discovery and invention of its associated milieux:

The principle of individualization of technical objects in an en-
semble is therefore the principle of the sub- ensembles of recurrent 
causality in the associated milieu; all the technical objects that have 
a recurrent causality should be separated one from the others and 
connected in a way to maintain this independence of their associ-
ated milieux.19

We should note here that it is necessary to keep the associated milieux 
separated; otherwise, the unified associated milieu would become the 
Achilles’ heel. Simondon’s technical individual in this instance specifically 
refers to a hardware system rather than to digital objects, which consist 
mainly of code. At first glance, we cannot reuse Simondon’s vocabulary 
to understand digital objects, because there is no such reciprocal causal 
mechanism inside the digital object that allows for its self- stabilization.20 
Alternatively, however, we can see that databases, algorithms, and network 
protocols become the associated milieux of digital objects. And as a digital 
object is also a set of logical statements, its reciprocal causality is highly 
controllable. The associated milieu cannot be thought of only as a mecha-
nism inside the individual but should instead be considered as something 
in between the exterior and interior milieux. When Simondon discusses 
nonindustrial civilization as a time when humans do not have industrial 
technical individuals (because they only use simple tools), he says that 
man’s “apprenticeship leads him to technical self- individualization. He be-
comes the associated milieu of the different tools he uses.”21 Humans cre-
ated the associated milieu for the tools through their gestures and habits, 
stabilizing and regulating the entire ensemble: tool— bearers themselves 
became technical individuals.



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 57

In this sense, we are able to identify the associated milieux for digi-
tal objects, each of which is further stabilized by the specific network in 
which it is situated, additionally including its users, data structure, net-
work protocols, and so on. To be stabilized by the system, it must also in-
clude various mechanisms that regulate it. The evolution and concretiza-
tion of these mechanisms allow a digital object to develop and integrate 
an associated milieu of its own, which is what Simondon calls a technical 
individualization, whereby something corresponds to what was illustrated 
before as the “objectification of data” or schematization. This process 
of individualization consists of three parts. First is the synthesis of data 
through the metadata scheme, which is comparable to Kant’s concept of 
the apprehension of objects. Second are the built- in constraints within the 
object, giving digital objects the capacity to regulate their identity within 
the digital milieu. For example, when considering an ontology of kinship, 
one can only have one mother and one father. And third, the object has 
now become a logical entity, hence it expresses a logical infrastructure as 
a constituent of the digital milieu. I will further demonstrate these three 
stages of the process in the following sections of this chapter. To push this 
still further, a digital object is also constantly in the process of reestablish-
ing and renegotiating its relations with other objects, systems, and users 
within their associated milieux. Digital objects also take up the functions 
of maintaining emotions, atmospheres, collectivities, memories, and so on. 
This gives us a dynamic and energetic understanding of digital objects. I 
want to distinguish this process as individuation.

As part of an industrialized civilization, human beings have begun to 
lose their role as technical individuals, as they become mere operators, 
either pushing a button, moving raw material, or cleaning the machine. 
This does not necessarily mean that the human’s position in the associ-
ated milieu will become any less important than it already is, or that hu-
mans will inevitably be ejected from the milieu as a whole. It is rather more 
likely that they will slowly become deskilled, and their technical knowl-
edge, which indicates their affinity to machines, will be reduced to the 
most superficial level. This, for Simondon, is the problem of alienation 
raised by Marx. Simondon compared the relation between technical ob-
jects and the human as the relation between the musician and the con-
ductor, as each produces an affect and is mutually affected by the other.22 
As with technical alienation, however, this mutual relation is destroyed. 
For Simondon, restoring this mutual relationship would be a means for 



58 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

developing a technological culture. Does the current technological trans-
formation offer us the possibility of doing this? On a social networking 
website, digital objects are not able to function on their own without the 
activities of human beings, who create and modify them. Without this in-
tervening creation and modification, machines would have nothing to pro-
cess. The new demands that are placed on humans do not mean that they 
regain their importance, however. As we will soon see, a change occurs 
within nature regarding man’s existence and experiences within technical 
systems. On one hand, we are witnessing humans becoming nothing more 
than digital objects themselves. However, on the other hand, we may also 
appreciate that they are integrating with machines, inaugurating a new set 
of operations under the names of social computing and crowd sourcing. We 
now have two fundamental understandings: first, that technical individu-
als individualize (Part I) by adopting and creating an associated milieu to 
stand independently, and second, that individuals individuate themselves 
through the collective— an assemblage or a network of relations and asso-
ciations in its world (Parts II and III). To go into this further, we will need 
to address the concretization of digital objects.

From GML to HTML: Form as Technical Tendency

The development of technicality is a process motivated by various inter-
ruptions and discontinuities. New technologies are able to cut through 
the lineage, giving it new directions. These directions may collide and di-
versify its progress into different paths; however, these diversities will be 
synchronized by a dominant technical tendency. The French paleontolo-
gist and paleoanthropologist André Leroi- Gourhan distinguishes tech-
nical tendency from technical fact. The former is universal and abstract, 
whereas the latter is particular and concrete, closely related to its milieux, 
that is, geography, ethnicity, climate, and so on. We can further distinguish 
different degrees of fact according to different modes of adaptation within 
ethnic groups. Technical tendency is inevitable and foreseeable; techni-
cal fact is unforeseeable and requires certain local inventions rather than 
direct borrowing from other groups.23 Leroi- Gourhan gave the example of 
forging. There are no technical tendencies of forging, only technical facts 
that depend on a varied range of conditions such as fire, metal, combus-
tion, fusion, commerce, mode, or religion. The technical tendency is the 
force that traverses the various milieux and cultural differences, for exam-



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 59

ple, the universal invention of wheels as a means of carrying heavy loads 
and handles for flint.24

The separation of form and matter, as evident among technical inven-
tions, is a technical tendency in this sense. Digital objects follow such a 
tendency. The semantic web is a specific technology utilized in computa-
tion among many users. It subsequently deviates from IBM’s Generalized 
Markup Language (GML) and from knowledge representation in AI (while 
incorporating some of their core concerns). Simondon called this process 
“the time of relaxation,” which equates to “the real technical time. It can 
become more dominant than all other aspects of historical time, to the 
extent that it can synchronize all other rhythms of development and ap-
pear to determine the whole technical evolution, whereas in fact it merely 
synchronizes and induces evolution phases.”25 Synchronization means 
convergence, which also demands a new form of technicity. This technical 
time is also the time of the technical perfection of objects, regarded as “a 
practical quality or, at the very least, the material and structural support 
for certain practical qualities.”26

GML was invented in the late 1960s by IBM, at a time when the Web 
hadn’t yet come into being. It served as a solution to a project that would 
require the integration of a text editing application with an information re-
trieval system and a page composition program. These applications could 
not be run on the same machine until Charles Goldfarb and his colleagues 
invented GML in 1969, a markup language that standardized the structure 
of the document:

This analysis of the markup process suggests that it should be 
possible to design a generalized markup language so that markup 
would be useful for more than one application or computer sys-
tem. Such a language would restrict markup within the document 
to identification of the document’s structure and other attributes. 
This could be done, for example, with mnemonic “tags.” . . . The 
actual processing commands, however, would not be included in 
the text, since these could vary from one application to another, 
and from one processing system to another.27

GML consists of application documentation, which defines the data ac-
cording to tags, and Document Type Definitions (DTDs), which sub-
sequently define these tags. We can draw two conclusions here: (1) the 



60 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

markup language gives “semantic” meaning to the data through the dis-
tinction of tags, so that the application will be able to process the data as 
an object and parse useful information, which will result in the first step 
of data organization, and (2) the markup language provides a solution to 
the problem of the incompatibility of applications and machines; in other 
words, it can connect all machines by presenting them with a common 
protocol. The concept of universality is very important in the history of 
the development of the Web, which, as conceived by Berners- Lee, is a 
universal space.28 GML separates the content from the form (metadata 
scheme) by acquiring the knowledge of the form, whereby the machines 
are not required to understand the semantic meaning of the entire con-
tent. This universal space is also determined by the universalization of the 
forms involved. These can be in the form of metadata schemes, protocols, 
or any other standard forms. This form versus content– matter hylomor-
phism has been a key concept in traditional metaphysics since the time 
of Plato and Aristotle. Matter subsumes itself as forms to actualize itself. 
Form is also a way of accessing the universal, because it provides idealities 
and particularities.

In 1986, the International Standard Organization (ISO) adopted an 
advanced version of the GML— later known as SGML, or Standard Gen-
eralized Markup Language— which prepared the pathway for the estab-
lishment of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) in 1991.29 HTML is a 
subset of SGML, but with a fixed DTD. The motivation behind HTML, 
following SGML, was strategical and partly political, as SGML was the 
dominant protocol at that time, and HTML can hence be more easily 
accepted by the community. Nevertheless, its separating of content and 
form was also a step with technological significance. Berners- Lee wrote 
that “an architectural rule which the SGML community embraced is the 
separation of form and content. It is an essential part of Web architecture, 
making possible the independence of the device mentioned above, and 
greatly aiding the processing and analysis.”30

Hylomorphism and Individualization

Here we should first place the concept of hylomorphism in its correct criti-
cal position. It is the most intuitive idea about technology, as suggested 
by Aristotle when he stated, “In speaking here of matter I have in mind, 
say, the bronze of a statue, while by shape- form I mean the geometry of 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 61

the object’s appearance and by the composite the statue itself as a whole 
entity.”31 One can make the criticism, as both Simondon and Heidegger 
did, that matter is not the passive object of the form but rather that form 
derives from matter. A good artisan creates the statue based on a particular 
status of the material or in seeing the form arise out of matter.32 This cri-
tique is nevertheless based on human experience, and it was valid specifi-
cally within the age of artisanal production. In the age of mass produc-
tion, however, this superiority of matter over form is reversed, because it 
is no longer a question of human skill but rather of the machine standards 
that create such forms. Form and matter here have two contrasting mean-
ings: (1) form is the compensation for the machine’s inability to under-
stand the semantic meaning of the content (comparable to the metaphor 
of molding, which is always a standard), and (2) form activates a pursuit 
of ideality that becomes a point of convergence for Western metaphysics 
with modern science and technology, or what Martin Heidegger would 
call the onto- theological constitution of things. The conceptualization 
of form over matter in the age of machine production exposes an innate 
contradiction within modernity. On one hand, the production process has 
sped up significantly due to the homogenous mold, which largely ignores 
the singularity of matters. On the other hand, form replaces all situational 
discourses with a set of rigid rules that further constitute various forms of 
life externally. This double- bladed argument continues to fuel an ongoing 
social debate, and yet a radical interpretation of form is still lacking.33

The architect Christopher Alexander, in his book Note on the Synthesis 
of Form, writes that “the ultimate object of design is form. The reason that 
iron filings placed in a magnetic field exhibit a pattern— or have form, as 
we say— is that the field they are in is not homogeneous. If the world were 
totally regular and homogeneous, there would be no forces, and no forms. 
Everything would be amorphous. But an irregular world tries to compen-
sate for its own irregularities by fitting itself to them, and thereby takes on 
form.”34 For Alexander, a design problem can only be solved by form, and 
the content of the problem is defined by its context. This somewhat reso-
nates with what we have seen in the introduction of the computationism 
of Chaitin and Fredkin. It is therefore necessary to distinguish the form 
as a technical tendency from the perception of technical objects in terms 
of their forms. However, in contrast to this conception of form as the ul-
timate force of production, Simondon suggests that a tool “is not made 
of matter and form only. It is made up of technical elements arranged 



62 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

from a certain system of usage and assembled into a stable structure by 
the manufacturing process.”35 Despite the fact we know that mass produc-
tion is mainly based on molding and the form– matter logic inscribed in 
it, the technical process cannot be simply explained by the principle of 
hylomorphism. The identity of a technical object equates to the totality of 
its production, as opposed to its form and matter. Simondon puts this in 
a rather extreme way: “There would be no exaggeration in saying that the 
quality of a simple needle expresses the degree of perfection of a nation’s 
industry.”36 This marks the departure from the individual determined by 
form toward a broader discourse of systematic determination. Indeed, 
both processes point to what Simondon calls the “historical singularity”: 
production itself is always the product of a historical moment distributed 
throughout the entire technical ensemble. Simondon suggests that de-
spite hylomorphism being insufficient to account for the current nature 
of technological production, it is still nevertheless an intuitive mode of 
thought that remains a dominant engineering principle. My hypothesis 
is that under different historical and technical conditions, hylomorphism 
produces something other than its intended effects in material terms. It 
consequently exposes the limits of the thinking that reproduces itself; 
hence our analysis must first place form under suspicion and reposition it 
as our analysis unfolds.

HTML was implemented for the World Wide Web in 1991 and has re-
mained the standard language that we use today. During the early days of 
the HTML markup scheme, metadata mainly focused on the structural, 
visual, and hypertextual representations of the page. The formalization 
and limitation of vocabularies has reduced its complexity, producing a 
light and portable language. In comparison with the Java programming 
language and the Web- based Java applet, HTML is very limited in terms of 
its programming power. Berners- Lee calls this approach based on simplifi-
cation the principle of least power.37

A metadata scheme, as a relatively weak language, expresses only forms, 
instead of having the capacity to manipulate forms and objects, which is 
what occurs within the Java programming language. HTML uses a set of 
standardized tags to indicate content representation in a logical format. 
As in the simple example of HTML in Figure 8, <p></p> denotes the in-
clusion of a paragraph (as structural), <b></b> denotes a bold font (as 
visual), and <a href= “url”></a> denotes a hyperlink (as hypertextual). 
We can probably say that HTML is a metadata scheme. As a fairly weak or 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 63

ineffective programming language, it does not provide the machine much 
information regarding the data on the page, being something external to 
the object it encodes. The same thing can be said for the use of images; for 
example, you can see in Figure 9 the appropriated tags used to describe an 
online image in the early HTML documentation, dated 1993.38

As we can see in Figure 9, the image should be a “small image” or “icon”; 
it is not possible to insert large images. The SRC indicates the URL, ALIGN 
indicates the visual display, and ALT indicates “alternative text,” which 
is “optional” and is the only place where additional metadata (without 
a semantically specific tag) can be added. These tags equate to all that a 
“digital image object” was on the World Wide Web in the year 1993. Then, 
in 1994, HTML 2.0 was produced, followed by the draft of HTML 3.0 
in 1995, followed by the release of HTML 3.2 in 1997. We can see that,

Figure 9. Specification of an image in early HTML protocol.

The IMG element allows another document to be inserted inline. The document is normally 
an icon or small graphic. This element is not intended for embedding other HTML text.

SRC  The value of this attribute is the URL of  
the document to be embedded. Its syntax is  
the same as that of the HREF attribute of the  
A tag. SRC is mandatory.

ALIGN  Take values TOP or MIDDLE or BOTTOM,  
defining whether the tops or middles or  
bottoms of the graphics and text should be  
aligned vertically.

ALT  Optional text as an alternative to the graphics  
for display in text-only environments.

gradually, further tags are added as the original tags are refined. HTML 
3.2 introduced tables, applets, text flow around images, subscripts, and su-
perscripts.39 We can compare this with the later version, HTML 4.0, as 
recommended by W3C in 1997 (see Figure 10).

We can see that there were some improvements made in HTML 4.0 
(or perhaps one can say it is a better “form”). Many more tags are avail-
able, such as those that specify the size of the image. We can see that it is 
no longer limited to “small images” and “icons.” The information is never-
theless still very limited, and it is nearly impossible for the computer to 
be able to identify what the picture is really about. One can still fill in 
<alt> to provide a short description of the image, although the computer 
would not be able to understand this unless it were able to interpret natu-
ral language. In fact, throughout the script, the term “object” is taken for 
granted without any explanation. There are two interesting tags we should 
pay attention to here: “usemap” and “ismap.” These tags equate to two 
different types of image maps, allowing further specification of what the 
image really is by linking an intended part of it to another URL. “Ismap” 
is a server- side image map; it is only designed for very old browsers that 
do not recognize “usemap” (which is a user- side image map). The image 
map refers to those of its relations that are external to the image itself, 
whereby we may begin to notice that the individual does not exist within

its own terms but is always related or linked to something else external. 
Above all, however, the most critical aspect of HTML 4.0 is that it is fully 
integrated with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), allowing a more advanced 
format definition and the presentation of a web page. Objects (both texts 
and images) can then be described in terms of markups, which make ex-
plicit their meanings, and can now be further formatted in terms of their 
appearances. We should also recognize that this is the process of objecti-
fication as concretization. The late 1990s saw the increased emergence of 
multimedia data in the forms of Shockwave, Flash, MP3, and so on, which 
naturally demanded an improved means of representation. Without these 
descriptions, the search engines would not be able to locate the data, and 
the data would eventually dwell in the dark corners of cyberspace, to re-
main forever lost and unknown. This outlined problem (the lack of se-
mantic meaning) would later be addressed by the recommendation of 
eXtensible Markup Language (XML).

XML and the Rise of Web Ontologies

XML was also an adaptation from GML, or rather SGML with a simpli-
fied syntax. The development of XML was primarily established to im-
prove the lack of flexibility of HTML and to lower the barrier of SGML, 
which was found to be too heavy to be used on the Web. XML also plays 
a significant role in what I mentioned earlier as the “time of relaxation.” 
Around the year 2000, there was the dichotomy between the Microsoft 
Windows (.Net) and Sun Java ( J2EE) frameworks; XML subsequently 
formed frameworks external to these, providing a bridge between the two 
technologies.40 In comparison with SGML, on one hand, XML placed 
some stricter rules on syntax, for example, denoting an unclosed tag as a 
mistake; on the other hand, it discarded some of the complicated syntaxes 
of SGML. One example of these differences is that for SGML, a DTD 
must be “valid,” whereas for XML, any well- formed data with a proper tag 
syntax will be allowed (even without a DTD). This makes XML easy to 
use, even for those who are not already familiar with the SGML specifi-
cations. A user would easily be able to create an XML file describing an 
image according to common sense and previous knowledge. See Figure 11.

If we compare this with the earlier example of HTML 4.0 (Figure 9), 
XML can achieve a lot by restricting the user- programmer to providing 
information on the objects according to what is in demand or what is 



66 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

considered to be useful. In the case in which a computer program is writ-
ten and designed to analyze data, it is subsequently able to track down 
information such as who retrieved this photo or image and where it was 
taken. Such information can be very useful for information retrieval, en-
abling the programmer to extend the XML by adding more attributes for 
a more detailed description in simple terms. Thus the description might 
state who is represented in the picture, when it was taken, and so on. This 
is the fundamental idea of XML, though there are many other technical 
details that will not be covered here. In terms of objectification, XML goes 
much further than HTML by imposing a more flexible yet stronger form. 
Parallel to this, it is able to share the restricted semantics with any ordi-
nary user. In 2000, W3C recommended XHTML (which is a combination 
of HTML 4.0 and XML 1.0) to adopt the HTML set of attributes toward 
structural and visual representation and include the syntax of XML for 
structured content presentation. For example, “namespace” (which can be 
understood as a prefix) is added, so prefix1:cat and prefix2:cat can be dis-
tinguished despite the fact that they share the common suffix “cat.” With 
these tags, a computer program will be able to extract these data from the 
web page automatically.41 What is interesting here, and also relevant to our 
discussion of hylomorphism, is the evident failure of XHTML2, which 
was introduced in 2002 and officially “died” in 2009. XHTML2 has been 
described as “a beautiful specification of philosophical purity that had 
absolutely no resemblance to the real world”;42 however, its fundamental 
problem was that it was simply too distant from the technical reality. It was 
neither backward compatible nor compatible with the common practices of 
developers. Because only a few developers used XHTML2, its death and 
disappearance did not cause much affect.

In April 2011, W3C introduced HTML 5.0, a single language that inte-
grates both earlier versions of HTML with XHTML. They introduced two

very significant changes that are relevant to our discussion here. The first 
change was the introduction of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs, 
for example, audio and video players, drag- and- drop APIs), which extend 
HTML from a textual representation to some forms of pseudo- software. 
The second improvement made by HTML 5.0 was to introduce a further 
series of <object> diversities, including <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, and 
so on. Many more attributes were added to enable better grasp of the ob-
jects, or rather, we may say, to achieve a greater “objectification” of data. Let 
us consider the example of <img> in HTML 5.0. One is now able to indi-
cate the appearance of an image according to its status as either “unavail-
able,” “partially available,” “completely available,” or “broken,” as well as to 
display the downloading status when showing the images.43

We have noticed that within digital objects, the concept of form con-
tinues to serve as a technical tendency within computing, although it is 
now standards that have become universal. Forms are abstract schemes, 
and standards are concrete objects. We must also bear in mind the other 
aspects of standardization that are political and economic. First, it is an 
enforced technical process that pursues the compatibility of computation 
on global scales, and second, it is also a marketing strategy that builds up 
networks of partners and alliances. We focus only on the first aspect here. 
Because XML is freely extensible, some programmer may use scheme A 
to describe an object, whereas another may prefer scheme B, the result 
being that there will be a lack of objectivity. Objectivity in this context 
should be understood to refer to the character of elements that come from 
an object itself and remain universal to the observers. In science, for ex-
ample, an objective method and an objective mode of observation exclude 
all forms of subjective and psychological interpretation. This understand-
ing of objectivity bears within it a paradoxical relation to universality. We 
have already discussed the first meaning of universality, in the context of 
the separation of content from form. Being universal, the form becomes a 
shared framework for every machine, whereby its modification may lead 
to incompatibility. So to disclose a form without variation, it must be seen 
objectively. This highlights one of the problems associated with the freely 
extensible XML. As XML guarantees the format and validity of the form, 
it does not guarantee the objectivity of the scheme (the set of tags used, in 
this case). This objective– universal correlation can be contrasted against 
another kind of universality, one that allows for differences. Berners- Lee 



68 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

was certainly not unaware of this contradiction, as he compared this sec-
ond understanding of the universal with the Unitarian Universalism reli-
gion.44 Unitarian Universalism incorporates doctrines from all religions, 
creating a space for differentiation. For Berners- Lee, this is one of his key 
design principles for the Web, for example, in his proposal concerning 
lightweight HTML and low- level XML. The minimization of forms allows 
for further extension and adaptation.

This ambiguity becomes obvious when XML is conceptually modified 
into an ontology. In an article published in Scientific American in 2001, Tim 
Berners- Lee and his collaborators proposed the idea of the semantic web 
as a place where, they envisaged, all objects are represented by standard 
ontologies. These ontologies, based on XML syntax, regulate the semantic 
meaning of the objects in a way that enables machines to understand and 
manipulate data. Each object– predicate is identified by a unique URL, 
which serves as an ID within the digital milieu. So not only do the objects 
have identities, but their components or predicates also have identities 
and are thus subject to control and manipulation. Berners- Lee and col-
leagues began with an imaginary scenario: that Pete and Lucy’s mother 
needed to see a specialist on a regular basis. Their semantic web agent (a 
computer program that is capable of analyzing ontologies) can tell them 
the location of the hospital, the best way of getting there, how to make 
an appointment with the clinic’s agent, and how to reschedule their own 
work to fit in with their mother’s appointments. Berners- Lee continues to 
describe the semantic web as follows:

The Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content 
of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents 
roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated 
tasks for users. Such an agent coming to the clinic’s Web page 
will know not just that the page has keywords such as “treatment, 
medicine, physical, therapy” (as might be encoded today) but also 
that Dr. Hartman works at this clinic on Mondays, Wednesdays 
and Fridays and that the script takes a date range in yyyy- mm- dd 
format and returns appointment times.45

What exactly is the difference between ontologies and XML? A techni-
cal explanation expresses the following: (1) “an ontology differs from an 
XML schema (which describes the structure of a XML document) in that 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 69

it is a knowledge representation, not a message format” and (2) “one ad-
vantage of OWL [Ontology Web Language] ontologies will be the avail-
ability of tools that can reason about them.”46 These two points of compari-
son require further discussion. Knowledge representation here doesn’t 
mean mere representation but is necessarily objective, so that what it pre-
sents can be recognized as an object instead of a set of textual messages. 
To reconcile objectivity and the two differing forms of universality, two 
presuppositions are to be made: (1) that there is an objective representa-
tion of things and (2) that their translatability can take place in between 
two representations of things, allowing the object from context A to be 
translated into an object from context B. This translation process is simply 
the translating of vocabularies and prefixes. If we stop to consider this for 
a few seconds, we realize that translation would be impossible without the 
second presupposition. What dominates here is the concept of objectivity 
as universal. Facts can only be meaningful when they can be subsumed to 
forms, whereby they can be regulated and calculated. Let us now examine 
the example in Figure 12 of an image in an ontology- driven information 
system. The figure shows a sample of data that were extracted from Flickr 
in 2007 (this is just a small sample of the metadata contained by this cho-
sen image;47 these data were extracted using Flickr’s public API function 
[Flickr.photos.getInfo]).48

The extracted data sample appears to be relatively large (considering 
it was already obtained a few years ago, it can be larger today); “what an 
image is” is apparently much greater than the sum of the definitions and de-
scriptions by which HTML 4.0 designates an image. We easily see that the 
information given here is much more extensive than that which we derive 
from actually looking at a picture and includes geodata, camera informa-
tion, the time of uploading, different reference IDs, friends’ information, 
and so on. We can even see that the image object simultaneously embeds 
various camera objects, author objects, location objects, and so on. An ob-
ject is therefore determined not just by a single form but by multiple forms 
(or by its ground, to echo Simondon). We shall return to the concept of 
ontology and relationality in the subsequent chapters of this book; our 
focus for now is simply to grasp the process of individualization— which 
is not simply the concretization of the object but also the creation of tech-
nical associated milieux without which it cannot function. Throughout 
the concretization process from GML to web ontologies, a digital object 
can be described in a more and more detailed manner, at the same time

establishing material connections over a broader milieu across further 
platforms and interfaces. The ontologies are then continuously format-
ted through the Resource Definition Framework (RDF) (proposed by 
the W3C). RDF is also based on the syntax of XML, thus having a logical 
form. An RDF statement follows the rules of first- order logic, such as in 
the following coding:

<subject>+<predicate>+<object>

This simplicity allows for an inference language and a succession of logical 
operations on a machine level. The transition from XML to a more logi-

cally defined RDF is a significant move toward an AI- motivated Web. In 
2002, another standard OWL was introduced to improve the performance 
of logical operations. OWL is precisely the language developed by the 
W3C for ontology construction. There are three versions of OWL, each 
differentiated according to its different purposes and complexities per use. 
The highest and most sophisticated level of OWL is a logical language 
that formulates variables such as class, property, relation, and cardinality. 
The use of OWL will benefit from the “availability of tools that can reason 
about them,” or in the words of Berners- Lee, the machine can “pretend to 
think.”49 The relations between OWL, RDF, First Order Logic (FOL), and 
Description Logic (DL) are further addressed in chapter 5.

72 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS

To summarize the preceding discussion of the individualization of 
digital objects, we have recognized that this process embraces three key 
concepts: universality, interoperability, and extensibility. These are all, co-
incidentally, synonyms for “objectivity.” Yet we can see that this objectivity 
is in fact in the constant process of evolution or individualization. This ob-
jectivity is not limited to human understanding but also requires machine 
interpretation. The discussion around the objectification and individual-
ization of the “digital milieu” has only very recently entered a more ma-
ture phase. Horizontally, we can see that forms have developed from GML 
(to allow compatibility between programs within a machine) to ontolo-
gies (across the Internet, in between machines), a process that gradually 
involves a greater number of objects, machines, and users to maintain its 
functionality and stability. We can also approach the associated milieu as a 
measurement of interoperability and compatibility here. Vertically, we can 
see that digital objects are always within a process by which they gradually 
become more concrete and individualized. HTML is simply a formatted 
text file full of data, whereas RDF is a complicated document coded with 
advanced programming and logical developmental capacity. The RDF-  or 
OWL- formatted ontologies thereby become similar to an object in object- 
oriented programming (OOP). OOP has three important properties: 
abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, whereby a class can be over-
ridden to generate new classes, which subsequently inherit certain prop-
erties and functions from the parent class. We can identify all these prop-
erties within the current concept of web ontologies.

The genesis of digital objects forms the beginning of an investigation 
into the dynamics of these objects, aimed at developing the scope for a 
better understanding of the meaning of this new genre of industrial ob-
jects. Following on from Simondon, we can apply the concept of genesis 
to digital objects, while additionally discovering new dynamics that we 
previously would have ignored and dismissed as mere objects. The genesis 
of digital objects is the process of concretization and materialization, first 
of forms, second of explicit relations and connections between objects. 
We can also see this as an evolutionary process of interobjectivities in con-
trast to intersubjectivities, which we further elaborate in chapter 4. Now at 
the end of this chapter, we have arrived at the creation of ontologies after a 
discussion of forms as a general technical tendency. Now we shall ask the 
question, where do these ontologies come from? and seek to understand 



 THE GENESIS OF DIGITAL OBJECTS 73

what is involved in the word and concept of ontology detaching from its 
metaphysical context and becoming purely practical. In the next chapter, 
these questions are addressed in greater depth through an investigation 
of the theories of Brian Cantwell Smith, Edmund Husserl, and Martin 
Heidegger concerning objects and ontologies.

· CHAPTER 2 ·

Digital Objects and Ontologies

The Origin of Digital Objects

In the previous chapter, we introduced the subject of this book— digital 
objects— and analyzed its technical lineage in terms of markup languages. 
But the investigation cannot end here, because what we have discussed 
is only a partial interpretation of Simondon’s understanding of technical 
evolution. The goal of this book is rather to investigate the existence of 
the digital object, mediating on its production, its implementation, and 
its use. We may diagrammatically grasp the “life cycle” of the digital object 
in terms of a triangle of processes (Figure 6). The first process is that in 
which the ontologists and computer scientists create a metadata scheme 
or ontologies for digital objects; the second process is the implementation 
of these schemes in databases and pieces of software, which creates a mi-
lieu for the digital objects. The digital object can hence be seen to exhibit 
its modes of being by situating itself within the digital milieu. The third 
process to be understood is that by which these objects and the machines 
construct a technological system, which further integrates human users 
into it. This triangle is composed of different technical ensembles.

We may want to address the first step concerning the origins of these 
objects: where did they come from? I said “origins” instead of “origin,” be-
cause they are always plural. One lineage entails multiple origins, and each 
origin presents us with philosophical thoughts concerning the existence of 
objects. The quest for origins is a method for discovering the knowledge 
(for example, Husserl’s The Origin of Geometry) that we already estab-
lished at the very beginning and that has already been obscured by his-
torical developments. Some origins still have effects in the present, but 
their sources are largely forgotten. A discussion of what Simondon calls 
the “absolute beginning” of technical objects will serve as the first step for 
our discussion. In the evolution from diode to triode, and then from to 
tetrode and pentode— the typical technical objects that Simondon used 



76 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

for illustration— he proposes that the absolute beginning is not the diode 
but is to be found “in the condition of irreversibility of the electrodes and 
the phenomenon of the transport of electric charges across the vacuum.”1 
This absolute beginning is the irreducible technical principle that serves as 
the foundation of technical objects. Can we pose the same question with 
regard to digital objects? How can we define their absolute beginning? If 
we trace the footprints, we can always find several different histories, for 
example, the digital object’s origin in military technology, in AI, or in the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) for humanities data, but these can be con-
sidered relative origins. They certainly deserve books within the field of 
history, but here we need to take a different position. Concerning this ab-
solute origin, I propose two directions, one purely technical and the other 
philosophical. The former is concerned with the syntactic operation of a 
machine, that is to say, a grammatical structure that machines can inter-
pret; the latter has been an ongoing philosophical quest for ontology since 
Aristotle.

First, we shall look into the notion of ontology. By the end of the pre-
ceding chapter, we had arrived at an understanding of web ontologies as 
the current phase of concretization of digital objects. It is also necessary 
to make the remark here that ontology has been around long before the 
web ontologies. Ontology was first formulated by Aristotle as “being qua 
being,” or more precisely, “a discipline which studies that which is, inso-
far as it is, and those features that it has in its own right.”2 The develop-
ment of ontology can be summarized, as we have already seen in the in-
troduction to this book, in terms of ontologies and Ontology. The former 
designates theory of formalization and representation; the latter refers to 
what Heidegger calls fundamental ontology. The former concerns being 
(Seiendes); the latter concerns Being (Sein). On its surface, this constitutes 
an opposition between Ontology and ontologies (or ontics, in Heidegger’s 
terms). We can probably say that Ontology is a critique of ontologies; how-
ever, we will also see later how ontologies become the material support of 
Ontology.

Second, we shall address the “syntactic nature” of computation. Com-
putational machines are generally described as “syntactic” rather than 
semantic machines; syntaxes are derived from forms rather than contents. 
The computer doesn’t actually understand the meaning of the sentence 
but only its syntax. John Searle’s Chinese Room thought experiment criti-



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 77

cally illustrates that “semantics is not intrinsic to syntax.”3 The experiment 
goes like this: imagine a non- Chinese speaker is sitting in a room, and a 
second person, who cannot see into the room, submits commands written 
in Chinese to him; the man inside the room— a black box— has to choose 
the right responses (with the correct Chinese characters) according to a 
set of rules that have already been provided. This “computer” passes the 
Turing test4 and has the ability to convince the observer that it under-
stands Chinese. It looks as if the computer understands Chinese, when in 
fact it doesn’t have any clue as to the meaning of the Chinese input; rather, 
it merely executes the commands or syntaxes according to rules that have 
been produced for it in advance. Searle further pointed out that such ma-
chines are not really following rules but are made to seem as if they are fol-
lowing rules. These syntaxes— computational states— are not inherent in 
physics but rather are assigned to a physical system; in other words, they 
don’t bear casual powers.5 Indeed, we can draw a parallel with the hylo-
morphism that we discussed in the previous chapter. Machines deal with 
commands not according to their meaning but according to the assigned 
syntax, which follows the rules of logic and the orders of symbols. For ex-
ample, given a simple XML markup of a book such as <book><title>On 
the Existence of Digital Objects</title></book>, the computer doesn’t 
necessarily know what “title” means, but when it sees the request “title,” 
it retrieves what is inside the field “title.” It is this principle by which ma-
chines “think.” The question of whether a computational machine has se-
mantics will be elaborated later. For now we need only to recognize that 
the syntactical nature of computation and markup languages makes the 
“semantics” in “semantic web” suspect.

This chapter will hence address these two issues— the notion of ontol-
ogy and the relation between syntax and semantics— through a progres-
sive study of the theories of various ontologies, while placing special focus 
on the cognitive and computer scientist Brian Cantwell Smith’s founda-
tional ontology, Edmund Husserl’s formal ontology, and Martin Heidegger’s 
fundamental ontology. The relation between ontology and semantics is not 
immediately evident here, but it will become clear that the discussion of 
semantics and syntax directs us toward an inquiry into the ontology of 
computation. The aim here is to argue that these two notions of ontologies 
cannot be separated from each other if we are to understand the existence 
of digital objects and that syntax and semantics should not be opposed 



78 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

in the way Searle has set out; instead, through analyzing these differences, I 
hope to show that these two oppositions need to be resolved by third terms, 
that is, ontogenesis and relations.

Onto- epistemology and First Philosophy

The American philosopher V. W. O. Quine has concisely summarized the 
study of ontologies: “The curious thing about the ontological problem is 
its simplicity. It can be put in three Anglo- Saxon monosyllables: ‘What 
is there?’ ”6 Let’s first bear in mind that it is not a question of “the what 
it is (τὸ τί ἐστι)” that Aristotle asked but rather “what is there.” There are 
two broad dimensions of the notion of “what is there”: there are things 
that exist even though we don’t know about them; there are things that 
we know to exist or have existed. Ontological questions concern the for-
mer, whereas the latter are considered the subject of epistemology. This 
relation between ontology and epistemology seems completely obscure: 
how can we understand the existence of something that we don’t know to 
exist? The question of the existence of God is subject to this difficulty and 
had occupied the central theme of medieval metaphysics. Even in terms 
of those things supposed to be known to exist, it is necessary to consider 
which particular person makes such a claim, which in turn depends on 
his cultural background and similar factors. Ontologists are very familiar 
with this dilemma. As Quine wittily puts it, “in any ontological dispute the 
proponent of the negative side suffers the disadvantage of not being able 
to admit that his opponent disagrees with him.”7 To disagree with some-
one’s ontology is to admit that there are things that I don’t countenance, 
which in turn becomes a negative admission of my own ontology. “What 
is there?” is not a question only for philosophers but also for scientists, 
and even for robots. So everyone actually encounters the same deficien-
cies of ontologies mentioned by Quine.

These defects were not happily admitted, because they denounced 
the possibility of universal categories (not only of grammar8) that would 
be accurate enough to describe the world. Philosophers after Aristotle 
wanted to search for a method that could firmly grasp the question of on-
tologies. Commenting on Aristotle’s effort to develop his ten categories, 
Kant wrote, “Locating these basic concepts was a project worthy of an 
acute man like Aristotle. But having no principle he snatched them up as 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 79

he came upon them.”9 Throughout history, we have seen many attempts 
to define such a universal language. Perhaps every known philosopher, 
and at least every epoch, has invented its own ontologies. In the intro-
duction to the book The Order of Things,10 the French philosopher Michel 
Foucault draws on the ontological scheme of seventeenth- century English 
philoso pher John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, and a parody made of it by 
the twentieth- century Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges, to demon-
strate this problematic search for essence. Bishop Wilkins, in his An Essay 
towards a Real Character and Philosophical Language, classified beings into 
nine categories with forty genres as set out in Figure 13. Wilkins’s taxon-
omy was designed to serve as the basis for an ideal language that would 
express every possible concept via systematic composition using a list of 
basic concepts.

In “The Analytical Language of John Wilkins,” Borges cites doctor 
Franz Kuhn, who attributed to a certain Chinese encyclopedia titled 
Celestial Empire of Benevolent Knowledge the following classification of 
animals:

(a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suck-
ling pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the 
present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with 
a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken 
the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off “look like flies.”11

Borges’s writing points to the problem of classification, as he says, “It is 
clear that there is no classification of the Universe not being arbitrary and 
full of conjectures. The reason for this is very simple: we do not know 
what thing the universe is.”12 This skepticism toward knowledge has its 
origin in the hypothesis that we don’t know the universe at all. Here the 
word “universe” becomes the object we scrutinize. And the question be-
comes, on what ground do we know what a thing is? We can state this in 
expanded form as a threefold argument. First, how can we be sure that 
what we have registered as existing really does exist? This is not to suggest 
that things don’t exist unless they can be verified by the mind but, rather, 
how can we know that they exist at all? Second, how do we know that what 
we know is the totality of the object itself and not just a part of it? Again, 
in Wilkins’s example, is there anything beyond our own experience and 
imagination? Third, how can I be certain that I share the same registration 
of the world as others (this the question of pluralism, of multiple worlds)? 
Worlds can be different from each other personally, culturally, politically. 
Borges’s rejection of Wilkins’s ontology demonstrates differences at a per-
sonal level, because Borges’s world is different from that of Wilkins. The 
example of the Chinese encyclopedia demonstrates cultural differences. 
Of course, today we know that it was probably a joke, but what if it were 
true, and on what grounds should it then be rejected or denounced by 
Western epistemology?

We can conclude that ontologies are relatively true, because they de-
pend on cultural differences. In fact, Émile Durkheim and his nephew 
Marcel Mauss showed in their work Primitive Classification that a social 
object is produced through its subsumption under social categories, 
which they call the “cultural character of categories of the understand-
ing.”13 The theory of social categories for them is the first philosophy and 
is comparable to Aristotle’s ontology. Their classification has its origin in 
the social structure, for example, in the correlation between classification 
and the division of clans, and ultimately has a religious origin expressed in 
totems. Durkheim and Mauss saw categories as technical fact rather than 
technical tendency. We can say that there is tendency within totemism, 
and that totems always manifest as different facts in different clans; hence 
one can also say that categories or classifications of things are technical 
facts. Durkheim and Mauss bring down the transcendental characteristic of 
categories but produce a secondary artificial a priori that is both historical 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 81

and technical. As Mauss claimed, the Durkheim school wanted to provide 
a sociological account of Aristotle’s categories to resolve the problem of 
the first philosophy: where do these categories come from?

Today it seems puzzling enough that facts are becoming tendencies 
through standardization. Because the technical tendency of networking 
technics demands different orders of compatibility on global scales, rang-
ing from the connection of physical optic cables to the development of 
network protocols and, with regard to digital objects as discussed here, 
the construction of categories, now we can easily admit that the construc-
tion of social categories basically has nothing to do with totems, which 
are identified as products of primitive societies. These categories traverse 
different ethnic groups and are propelled by the force of globalization. 
They are made universal through bureaucracy, by marketing campaigns, 
and above all by ignorance. For example, a few years ago in a W3C work-
shop in Barcelona in which I participated, a young engineer was very eager 
to propose that one can develop a set of minimum categories to describe 
digital objects, for example, everyone has a father or a mother. Another 
participant responded, how the case of Japan and China, where the uncle 
from the mother’s side and the uncle from the father’s side have different 
titles? Shall they all be called uncle? How then can this need for objectiv-
ity be addressed? And what kind of method should be employed instead 
of common sense?

Ontologies and Knowledge Representation

The idea of a universal language seems to have been defeated analytically, 
because the ontological commitments of the observers are sensitive not 
only to sentiments but also to cultural heterogeneity. We should note 
some of the further developments after this defeat: first, it marks the tri-
umph of formal logic, which takes content out of “language” and deduces 
a pure “grammar” or “form”; second, it proceeds with the emergence of 
domain- oriented or specific formal ontologies in information systems 
based on practice and pragmatic reasoning; and third, it realizes the uni-
versalization of particular ontologies through technological globalization 
and industrial standardization, which we briefly discussed earlier. In com-
puter science, there exists a large number of research projects on ontolo-
gies, and the investigations and proposals arising from them vary greatly 



82 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

according to their specific domains and approaches. In this section, we 
look at a “commonsense” approach to ontologies, and in a later section, we 
engage in a more focused discussion of formal ontology.

The current development of the “web ontologies” has taken a very prag-
matic and simplistic approach— or perhaps one should say that it comprises 
a minimal number of categories concerning objects. A lot of the work on 
web ontologies emerged from an important subject in computing called 
knowledge representation, which has been an important topic for AI since 
the 1980s. The computer scientist Tom Gruber defines ontology as “a 
specification of a conceptualization.”14 He gives the further elaboration 
that “ontology is representation artefact (a specification), distinct from 
the world it models, and . . . it is a designed artifact, built for a purpose.”15 
An ontology is the representation of the knowledge one has of the world, 
and it is composed of both a formal and an informal part: the formal parts 
work like axioms that allow meanings to be derived (syntax); the informal 
parts are, for example, explanations in a dictionary, composed of free texts 
(semantics to which machines are indifferent).

The definition proposed by Gruber is an attempt to formally represent 
the domain, and the relations between the objects within the domain, 
that are useful for the operation of the information system. But it is neces-
sary to reflect not only on what he refers to as “conceptualization,” that 
is, what is to be represented, but also “specification.” Because machines in 
the mechanical age were isolated, information input and output were con-
fined to the machine’s predefined domain. However, in the information 
age, machines are connected physically and materially by communication 
networks; one function of the machine may simultaneously operate on 
different protocols and domains. Because these networks run across geo-
graphical regions as well as different cultures, they have to remain invari-
able. Besides domain- specific ontologies, “upper ontologies,” which repre-
sent general concepts, are also required for translation between different 
domains. In this sense, we see that universal standardizations are driven 
by technical progress and knowledge transmission, which are inevitable 
processes. If we follow Tom Gruber, we may consider that computation 
proposes a more modest response by removing universalis and replacing it 
with specialis. Specification also refers to a pragmatic reasoning that would 
restrict questions according to certain specifics. Nevertheless, specifica-
tion doesn’t hold on the Web: because it is available for different users in 
different cultures, it is global from the very beginning, or it has already 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 83

been dialectically sublated to the “universal,” with the specifics remaining 
only a pretext.

To demonstrate this, we are going to look at two “upper ontologies” or 
“knowledge bases” to see the complexity of a single notion within a large 
domain as well as to observe the translation between different domains. 
One of the projects is CYC, which was founded in 1984 by Douglas Lenat 
as a knowledge base to represent what is called commonsense knowledge. 
The other one is SUMO (for Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), which 
seeks to serve a similar purpose. The project is now live, having accumu-
lated up to twenty thousand terms and seventy thousand axioms.16 Let’s 
look at the definition and hierarchical relations of the term transaction in 
both domains.17

In the examples in Figures 14 and 15, we can see that the term transaction 
is situated at different levels of hierarchy and that the two ontologies don’t 
use the same vocabularies to communicate. These “upper ontologies” are 
often used as higher- level ontologies to integrate different domain- specific 
ontologies, that is, by acting as reference points. Alternatively, if we con-
sider further integrating these two large knowledge bases, a new knowl-
edge base that includes at least the entire collection of both vocabularies 
will have to be developed. Initiatives like the Open Ontology Reposi-
tory18 are making such attempts. We should also consider the question of 
whether, when a specific ontology becomes a reference, it can be specific 
at all, or whether it has to carry some universal characteristics.

Husserl and the Origin of Formal Ontology

Another branch of study of ontology is formal ontology. In comparison 
with web ontologies that come out of practical needs and amateur prac-
tices, formal ontologies are philosophically informed applied ontologies. 
The works of Barry Smith, Nicola Guarino, Boris Hennig, and John Sowa 
are very important resources for understanding this discipline, and their 
philosophical rigor deserves further attention. Nicola Guarino criticized 
Gruber’s understanding of “conceptualization” as being problematic be-
cause Gruber’s understanding comes from AI textbooks, according to 
which it merely means “structure.” It only conceptualizes a domain ac-
cording to “extensional relations,” for example, “the cup is above the table” 
(“above” is an extensional relation). Instead of extensional relations, he 
proposes to focus on intentional relations, for example, addressing what 



84 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

is meant by “above.” Hence Guarino has redefined ontology as “a logi-
cal theory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal vocabulary, 
i.e. its ontological commitment to a particular conceptualization of the 
world. The intended models of a logical language using such a vocabulary 
are constrained by its ontological commitment. An ontology indirectly

Transaction—The collection of actions performed by two or more agents cooperating 
(willingly) under some agreement wherein each agent performs actions in exchange for 
the actions of the other(s). Note that a case of attack-and-counterattack in warfare is not 
a Transaction; nor is fortuitous cooperation without agreement (e.g. where a group of 
investors who, unknown to each other, all buy the same stock almost at once, thereby 
driving up its price). For transactions involving an exchange of user rights (to goods and/or 
money) between agents, see the specialization of ExchangeOfUserRights

Process—Intuitively, the class of things that happen rather than endure. A Process is 
thought of as having temporal parts or stages, and so it cannot have all these parts 
together at one time (contrast Object). Examples include extended ‘events’ such as a 
football match or a race, events and actions of various kinds, states of motion and lifespans 
of Objects, which occupy the same space and time but are thought of as having stages 
instead of parts. The formal definition is: anything that lasts for a time but is not an Object. 
Note that a Process may have participants ‘inside’ it which are Objects, such as the players 
in a football match. In a  4D ontology, a Process is something whose spatiotemporal extent 
is thought of as dividing into temporal stages roughly perpendicular to the time-axis.

reflects this commitment (and the underlying conceptualization) by ap-
proximating these intended models.”19 Guarino calls this type of ontology 
formal ontology, following Edmund Husserl.

Husserl first developed the concept of formal ontology in the first vol-
ume of Logical Investigations and subsequently in Formal and Transcenden-
tal Logic.20 In Logical Investigations, Husserl describes formal ontology as 
the “eidetic science of the object as such.”21 This approach derives largely 
from Husserl’s take on categories and forms, especially in terms of what he 
calls categorial intuition.22 To put it in simple terms, the way we perceive an 
object, regardless of whether it is real or abstract, always corresponds to 
an intuition that is categorial and not purely temporal and spatial, as Kant 
had understood pure intuitions. These categories are formal in the sense 
of having an ideal form that corresponds to both the expression of the real 
object, for example, a white sheet of paper, and an abstract relation such 
as “part of.” In Formal and Transcendental Logic, Husserl further develops 
his concept of formal ontology by contrasting it with “regional” or “ma-
terial” ontology. “Regional ontology” concerns the regional essence of 
things, for example, a Cheshire cat with such and such properties (yellow 
in color, a smile without a face, etc.). So regional ontology is the catego-
rization of the real and material, and it determines the hierarchy of genus 
and species. According to Husserl, this corresponds to Kant’s “synthetic 
a priori.” Formal ontology deals with the ideal, with “any object what-
soever” (etwas überhaupt) that doesn’t belong to the material essence.23 
For example, relations between the universal and the particular, or be-
tween part and whole, are formal structures. Husserl’s part– whole theory, 
developed in the third investigation, later serves as the foundation for 
modern mereology, as an alternative to set theory. The best example of 
formal ontology one can think of is geometry, which comes out of physi-
cal landscapes and objects, without being concerned with their material 
dimension, only their relations. For Hennig, “formal ontology studies the 
most general features of real objects by reflecting on the forms by virtue of 
which we identify them.”24

The philosopher and ontologist Barry Smith takes a similar critique of 
Guarino that the AI researchers didn’t pay enough attention to the parallel 
research in philosophical ontology. According to Smith, John McCarthy 
was the first AI scientist to discover this in the 1980s and has formulated his 
research on ontology through the reading of Quine: “list everything that 
exists, building an ontology of our world.”25 Smith distinguishes formal 
ontologies from formal logic. If every object could be approached in terms 



86 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

of formal truth (formal structures or relations in the underlying region of 
objects) and material truth (material structures or relations), and if form 
and matter are distinguished on the level of truth and the level of things, 
“then formal ontology consists in the investigation of formal structures or 
relations on this second level; it concerns itself only indirectly with for-
mal truths on the first level.”26 Smith further distinguishes two approaches 
toward philosophical ontology: one is the Frege– Russell– Wittgenstein 
reductionist approach, the other the (early) Brentano– (early) Husserl– 
Ingarden approach that deals with experience.27 Bearing this distinction 
in mind, it is, however, important to notice here that references to Husserl 
are always to his earlier work Logical Investigations rather than to Formal 
and Transcendental Logic, in which the notion of formal ontology is much 
more mature. Another definition from the social scientist Roberto Poli, 
who works in the field of formal ontology and the humanities, can further 
illustrate this. Similarly to Smith, Poli subdivides the “formal” of formal 
logic into “logical formal” and “ontological formal”:

Logical formal concepts are thus negation, conjunction, implication 
and quantifiers. Ontological formal concepts are: object, state of af-
fairs, unity, plurality, number, relation, connection (Prolegomena), 
subject and determination, individual, species and genus, quality, 
cardinal number, order, ordinal number, whole, part, magnitude.28

This stroll through the definition of formal ontology intends not only to 
hint at the amount of research that has been done in this field but also 
wants to highlight its relation to Husserl’s philosophy. Formal ontology 
is an area of study that attempts to understand the existence of objects in 
terms of different modalities and relations in and to the world. In com-
parison with the “commonsense” ontologies, we can see that it is more 
a philosophical task than one of mere inductive reasoning. However, we 
have to pay extra attention to the fact that this reading of formal ontol-
ogy is a very specific take on Husserl, and one I doubt Husserl himself 
would have agreed with. Poli’s description of it is reasonable to some ex-
tent, because it corresponds to the program of formal logic in Formal and 
Transcendental Logic, where Husserl in this first part of the book concludes 
that formal logic includes formal apophantic logic and formal ontological 
logic; the former focuses on judgments, the latter focuses on the “possible 
categorical objectivities themselves.”29 What is crucial, and that Poli didn’t 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 87

mention, is that, for Husserl, formal ontology as well as formal logic de-
mands a transcendental foundation, and the part on formal logic is only a 
preparation for the second part on transcendental logic. Therefore I sug-
gest instead that we ought to bear in mind that what lies behind formal 
ontology for Husserl is the phenomenological method, and phenomenol-
ogy is the methodology of ontology, a point that formal ontologists have 
seemingly not appreciated.

Husserl’s phenomenology aims to ground human knowledge and hence 
establish the foundation for all sciences. Cognitive science and computa-
tion’s affiliation with the early Husserl coincide with Husserl’s proposal 
for a pure logic through the study of intentionality. The word intentionality 
comes from medieval philosophy, in particular from the concept of inten-
tional inexistence. It was used for an object that was absent from the physi-
cal world, or an imaginary object, or an object of memory— an object that 
human beings are still able to think about even in its inexistence. The early 
Husserl’s phenomenology promises to grasp the epideictic truth of objects 
as ideality, a truth without any presupposition. Husserl’s “pure seeing” is 
different from the “natural seeing” of the nave realists. For Husserl, pure 
seeing means to grasp objects in their eideticity in consciousness; natural 
seeing is a gaze that doesn’t question what is seen. It is also different from 
the multiple “points of view” of relativism and is a matter of seeing to go 
beyond the transcendence of objects by bringing them to the immanence 
of consciousness. To do this, Husserl proposes the epoché, or bracket-
ing of the ego from all presupposition, and starting from the pure ego.30 
Phenomenology is the description of the pure ego’s experience of objects 
through intentionality.

Let’s take the view in Formal and Transcendental Logic, where Husserl 
questioned the notion of objectivity taken for granted by logicians by pass-
ing from a formal logic to a transcendental logic. Objectivity, for Husserl, 
has its foundation in subjectivity, for example, counting and combining;31 
hence Husserl reproaches the logicians for a lack of “a serious philosophic 
exploration of the origin of the concepts fundamental to formal mathe-
matics.” Husserl classifies formal logic as “formal apophantic” and “formal 
ontology” (this already differs from Smith’s classification). One has to bear 
in mind that Formal and Transcendental Logic tends to be a programmatic 
outline of Husserl’s project; it also reads as Husserl’s self- reflection of such 
a program, hence we can see that he moves back and forth all the time. 
The formal apophantic concerns three levels, namely, pure morphology of 



88 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

judgments, logic of consequence (or of noncontradiction), and logic of 
truth.32 We can also say that it concerns meanings of syntactical operation, 
which Husserl calls the “categories of signification,” and which belongs to 
the “region of meanings” as distinct from the object.33 In general, formal 
apophantics deals with “syntactical categories,” whereas formal ontology 
deals with “objective multiplicities.” Husserl tries to point out in Formal 
and Transcendental Logic that formal logic since Plato onward has been 
developed into a deductive system and attends its maturity in Leibniz’s 
concept of the mathesis universalis, which he identifies with formal logic. 
Husserl’s task, as Suzanne Bachelard clearly stated in her A Study of 
Husserl’s Formal and Transcendental Logic, is to go beyond the formal criti-
cism of cognition, meaning mathesis universalis, to a transcendental criti-
cism, only which can “truly set up a universal theory of science, for it is 
the criticism of the intentional life that itself ‘constitutes’ provinces and 
theories.”34 Husserl’s strategy was first to question his own preceding sepa-
ration of formal logic as both apophantic logic and formal ontology:

Can a formal ontology be at all distinguished from an apophantic 
logic, if only as the latter’s correlate, yielded by a mere change of 
focus from propositions to objects? . . . But what if we wished to 
determine the table purely by concepts belonging to “formal ontol-
ogy,” like object, property, relationship, and plurality— that is to say 
variational concepts pertaining to anything- whatever? Are these 
something other than “categorial” concepts— that is: concepts that 
have accrued through merely looking abstractively at the syntacti-
cal forms in which the object is apprehended at varying levels in 
syntactical actions, actions of judgement?35

Husserl is binding apophantic logic to formal ontology, because to appre-
hend the object on one hand one will need a formal ontology specifying 
the relations between the state of affairs, the part and the whole, and on 
the other hand, one should also be able to derive a logical method than 
maintains its consistency, so that both disciplines “stand in perfect cor-
relation throughout and, for that reason, must be held to be a single sci-
ence.”36 Objectivity is always based on modes of categorical forms, and the 
phenomenological method is a science that attempts to attend this cate-
gorial objectivity. In this sense, logic and ontology cannot be separated, 
because the validity of a judgment (consider the copula s = P) demands 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 89

something other than itself. The move from a formal logic to a transcen-
dental logic is to establish a phenomenological foundation of the “formal,” 
which is intentionally formal (subjective) but not extensionally formal 
(symbols), and hence “transcends objective logic by integrating it into a 
logic able to attain a full understanding of itself.”37 In the research of for-
mal ontologies, the phenomenological method is rarely discussed, and the 
central concept that Husserl calls sense- investigation (Besinnung), based 
on the two poles of the consciousness and its object, seems to have been 
forgotten or ignored. Sense- investigation bases on the two poles, namely, 
the consciousness and its object; and in the face of confusions of manner 
of the giveneness of object as well as the lack of clarity of judgment, the 
consciousness demands a sense- explication (Sinnauslegung) process as a 
dialectics between the evidence and fulfillment of meanings.38 Guarino’s 
definition of formal ontology as “a logical theory accounting for the in-
tended meaning of a formal vocabulary” carries a true Husserlian spirit; it 
also bypasses the transcendental critique that distinguishes Husserl from 
other logicians, such as Frege and Carnap. We elaborate on this question 
in chapter 5, with a focus on Husserl’s later work Experience and Judgement. 
Husserl’s phenomenology is not an easy subject to explain, hence in the 
rest of this chapter, we direct our focus to certain of his concepts, such as 
intentionality, and objects that are relevant to our investigation.

Machine Intentionality and Computational Ontology

Before continuing our discussion of Husserl’s formal ontology and its 
intentional economy, I would like to introduce here the work of Brian 
Cantwell Smith. Cantwell Smith is not one of those ontologists in the 
camp of Barry Smith; instead, I think that more than anyone else, Cantwell 
Smith has integrated Husserl’s phenomenological approach into the de-
velopment of formal ontology. Cantwell Smith is also a philosopher of 
computation, whose work is concrete and speculative, while remaining ig-
nored by the philosophy community. The introduction of Cantwell Smith 
here serves first as an opportunity to return to the question of syntax and 
semantics, which we characterized as a way to think about the origins of 
digital objects; second as a chance to elaborate on the concept of ontol-
ogy, because Cantwell Smith’s work is a critique of the naive practices 
found in computer science, which has rarely taken ontology seriously; and 
last by reading Cantwell Smith and Husserl together, which allows us to

move from a human intentionality to one that can also be addressed to 
machines. It is to find a new common ground between the formal logic 
and transcendental logic, hence preparing for what I try to sketch in chap-
ter 5, a transductive logic.

At first glance, ontologies and semantics are not really two wholly sepa-
rate subjects. So far, we have given an account of what ontologies mean 
for humans, but what do these objects mean to machines? We have seen 
that digital objects are composed of formal and structural relations. Is this 
only meaningful to their creators and users? Or, in the process of imple-
mentation, have we already assumed them to be objects for machines? 
That is to say, have we already granted this intuitive power to machines? 
It is certain that at the level of circuitry, digital objects are only voltage 
differences. But do machines experience them as “objects” in their opera-
tions? In the preceding exposition, we have to some extent assumed that 
machines are merely “syntactic.” Formal ontologies and knowledge repre-
sentations discussed thus far are only concerned with representations or 
social conventions,39 that is, they are human- centric: I, the ontologist, rep-
resent the world as such and take this representation to be objective. But 
ontologies are more than representations. Kant already shows this in his 
Critique of Pure Reason: categories are productive (erzeugend); they work 
as a function that creates the concept of the object or the object in the 
mind together with other faculties. The mind- dependent objects are sec-
ondary objects, but objects nevertheless. Some neuroscientists (especially 
in the camp of neurodynamics) may question whether there is really con-
ceptual representation in the mind, but in the machines, it is undeniable. 
They are not only conceptual but also material and subject to calculation 
and interaction.

This issue is also related to the “syntactic” machine, which already sug-
gested that machines are not able to take account of “objects” as demon-
strated in Searle’s Chinese Room thought experiment. We have to ask, 
what does “thinking” mean here? And what is the “semantic” of an on-
tology (semantic web)? When Berners- Lee talked about the global mind 
and the semantic web, did he only mean it analogically? We have to re-
mind ourselves that both thinking and semantics here refer to a specific 
understanding of human cognition. The idea of the syntactic machine is 
in itself a denial of the idea of the intentionality of machines. This chal-
lenge can be understood as implying that (1) because computation is both 
syntactic and formal, there is no semantics; (2) intentionality has funda-



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 91

mentally to do with semantics; and (3) therefore computation is not at all 
intentional.40 From the outset, engineers have assigned logical statements 
to computers, while the computers themselves have no sense of their 
meanings at all. One can therefore argue that if computers understood 
semantics, they would be derivative but not original semantics. As Brian 
Cantwell Smith critically puts it,

many people have argued that the semantics of computational 
systems is intrinsically derivative or attributed— i.e., of the sort 
that books and signs have, in the sense of being ascribed by outside 
observers or users— as opposed to that of human thought and 
language, which in contrast is assumed to be original or authentic. 
I am dubious about the ultimate utility (and sharpness) of this 
distinction and also about its applicability to computers.41

Cantwell Smith argues that we can actually think about a theory of inten-
tionality on top of a theory of computation. He proposes that, first, one 
has to ask, what is semantics, or more precisely, what are those seman-
tics that philosophers claim a machine doesn’t have?— because for him, 
empirically, a machine doesn’t work on mere representations and sym-
bols. Second, one has to ask whether intention has necessarily and only 
to do with semantics, and if so, again, what kind? His own argument can 
be summarized as, first, that derivativeness is the origin of computation 
and, second, that derivative semantics is still real semantics. He insists 
that symbols must have semantics— “i.e., have an actual interpretation, 
be interpretable, whatever— in order for there to be something substan-
tive for their formal manipulation to proceed independently of. Without 
a semantic character to be kept crucially in the wings, the formal sym-
bol manipulation construal would collapse in vacuity.”42 This entails that 
there is some sort of intentionality, or at least that there are cognitive ac-
tivities of some kind, within computers. In other words, instead of being 
pure symbols or semantics of natural languages, there is something else 
in the operations of objects inside machines.

For Cantwell Smith, computational data are like sense data and should 
be treated as flux of consciousness, and computation (as well as cognition) 
acts on this flux to categorically create the objective form out of it. Here 
we can see an important link between metadata, metadata schemes, and 
digital objects. Under the intention of algorithms, metadata schemes act 



92 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

as categories and create objective forms from the flux of data and hence 
present us with digital objects. Cantwell Smith’s speculative project is 
to develop a foundational theory for computation grounded on objects, 
which he calls “successor metaphysics” and the “metaphysics of presence.” 
Semantics of machines can be revealed when this approach toward ontolo-
gies is well clarified. Smith also admits the problem of the uncertainty of 
knowledge representation and argues that what is at stake is not only the 
ontology of computation but also the nature of ontology itself. Our on-
tologies of the world are closely related to our commitment to the world; 
thus the engineer’s understanding of a medical ontology is different from 
that of a doctor, because they have different commitments to and engage-
ments with the world with which they are dealing. To expose this prob-
lem within the understanding of ontology in computing, Cantwell Smith 
proposes to go back to the origin of objects, that is, to the question of how 
organisms perceive things. He then proceeds to how this theory can be 
applied to the construction of ontologies in machines:

There is no way to proceed on the overall project, of developing a 
comprehensive theory of computation that meets both the empiri-
cal and conceptual criteria, except by taking on metaphysics and 
ontology directly.43

This means that to look into the matter, one should reexamine the con-
cept of representation. Cantwell Smith’s project proposed that it is neces-
sary to think about objects by situating them in their own world, in the 
sense that he calls “foundational.”44 According to Cantwell Smith, our rep-
resentations of the world, as well as our ontological commitments to the 
world, originate from this registration, which also underlies the possibil-
ity of computation. In the end, Cantwell Smith states that “the distinction 
between representation and ontology is indefinite, vague, unstable, etc.,”45 
because

one cannot press on the whats, the whethers, the whys, and the 
wherefores of representation without facing up to the ontological 
and metaphysical commitments of the people who use them to 
register. And one cannot do these things because representational 
practices and metaphysical commitments are not independent 
phenomena.46



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 93

He has developed a theory of registration, referring to the correlation be-
tween the subject’s perception and the object’s presence. To Cantwell 
Smith, one has to think about the origin of objects, and to approach this 
foundation is necessarily a task of metaphysics. He situates registration 
as the middle term lying between representation and ontology, the link 
between the “what is it?” of ontology and the “how is it represented?” of 
epistemology. This is also the intentional correlation between the subject 
and the objects. Moreover, the registration process reveals that both com-
puter scientists and machines have to understand ontology as dynamics of 
registration rather than static categories. Cantwell Smith’s project, to my 
understanding, has two effects: first, he reproaches computer scientists for 
paying little attention to ontology and intentionality, and hence remain-
ing dogmatic in constructing ontologies, and second, he demonstrates 
how a subject– object correlation approach to ontologies can be thought 
not only for humans but also for machines. He devotes two chapters to 
the idea of registration, the first of which we will discuss here as the most 
relevant to our project. This discussion of registration will also lead us 
to recognize the similarity between the approach of Cantwell Smith and 
Husserl’s phenomenological method, though they use different vocabu-
laries. I hope that through the following comparison, we can establish a 
solid link between the phenomenological inquiries of the twentieth cen-
tury and the philosophy of computation that has always been associated 
with analytic philosophy. Cantwell Smith’s project “the origin of objects” 
coincides with phenomenology’s slogan “back to things themselves.” In-
deed, Cantwell Smith’s book On the Origin of Objects is striking for the 
impressive way it integrates some threads of the different phenomenolo-
gies of Husserl and Heidegger, for example, the former’s understanding of 
cognition and the latter’s discussion of being- in- the- world.

Cantwell Smith on the Origin of Objects

Cantwell Smith analyzes registration through the interaction between 
the proto- subjective region (s- region) and the proto- objective region 
(o- region). The idea of registration involves a process with three steps 
referred to as “tracking,” “separation,” and “stabilization.” Taking Smith’s 
example, let’s imagine that a frog sees a fly that is flying in front of it and 
constantly in movement. The frog detects the presence of the fly, but with-
out paying attention. This is the Husserlian concept of pre- predication, as 



94 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

that which happens before the subject’s intentional act. Then the fly flies 
away at the sight of the frog; this sudden change demands a retraction, to 
notice the flying away of the fly. Now the frog starts registering the fly to 
have an idea about it. This is what Husserl calls “explication”: the inten-
tional act that acts like a camera lens, able to zoom in on a certain aspect of 
the fly. The subject is able to explicate what is present through ideation of 
the object by modifying what Husserl calls the “horizon.” Smith expresses 
it in this way:

Taking an object as an individual means gathering up an extended 
region of the flux and treating it as a unity. This implies that the 
subject must stand in relation to what it is as a unity. This implies 
that the subject must stand in relation to what is the same or in 
common across the constitutive spatial and temporal region, and 
by the same token must ignore or set aside the multitudes of inter-
nal variation attendant to its parts, or across its life.47

This compares with Husserl’s phenomenological approach, whereby he 
takes consciousness as a flux and sees the responsibility of the mind as 
being to unify this flux to form a unity of the object as such. The phenome-
nological reduction is an attempt to produce the idealization of the object 
through the ideation of this unity.48 For example, when I see a house from 
the side and afterward from the back, I know that it is the same house. 
Even if, one day, part of the wall falls down, I can still recognize it as the 
same house. The absence of the house doesn’t destroy this idea at all but 
rather confirms the idea as such. Cantwell Smith continues by saying that 
this separation is important, since things are present because of their ab-
sence. In Cantwell Smith’s own language, the s- region must be separated 
from the o- region in the coupling, and the s- region will be able to stabilize 
through this detachment. This absence is the condition for retention, and 
this retention brings the object into presence:

To put it more carefully: in order to be present, ontologically— i.e., 
in order to be materially present— an object must also be (at least 
partially) absent, metaphysically, in the sense of being partly out of 
effective reach.49

This coincides with Husserl’s view that absence or inexistence is precisely 
the theoretical foundation of intentionality. Intentionality designates the 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 95

ability of the ego to correlate the world given to him, or in Husserl’s own 
refrain, “consciousness is to be conscious of something.” A further exam-
ple can be illustrated with Husserl’s idea of the time- consciousness of the 
temporal- object (Zeitobjekt),50 which is the interplay between what he calls 
primary retention, secondary retention, and protention. Primary reten-
tion is the impression that is retained in past immediacies. The past im-
mediacies can be further retained and collected in memory, which is the 
secondary retention.51 The retentions condition protention, which is both 
anticipation and projection.

Actually, Cantwell Smith drew a parallel between the correlation be-
tween subject and object through the process of stabilization and Husserl’s 
distinction between the temporality of perception and the perception of 
temporality (also between Kant’s consciousness of unity and unity of con-
sciousness);52 the first notion refers to the ability to identify that the fly 
that flies from one side to another is the same fly when it is stationary, 
whereas the second refers to the ability to unify different perceptions of 
“the” fly into the concept of “a” fly. In this manner, Smith’s registration can 
be conceived as similar to Husserl’s concern with a cognitive mechanism 
(temporality of perception) rather than a psychological one (perception 
of temporality). Registration is important for Cantwell Smith because it 
is the condition in which the subject is able to participate in and represent 
the world.

We can see here that the two correlations, (1) syntax– categories and 
(2) semantics– meanings, cannot be easily separated. But astonishingly, in 
the bibliography of his book, there is no reference to Husserl’s works at 
all.53 This is not at all to criticize Smith’s project; in fact, it is here through 
the work of Cantwell Smith that we can establish such an intimacy be-
tween phenomenology and computation, which also presents us with a 
new kind of speculative reason. Nevertheless, there is still a difference be-
tween Husserl and Cantwell Smith, in that Cantwell Smith is compara-
tively more concerned with going “back to objects” than Husserl. Cantwell 
Smith pays more attention to references, whereas Husserl pays more at-
tention to judgments; that is to say, for Husserl, it is always the subject 
that determines the unity of the objects, whereas for Cantwell Smith, the 
individuality is always a constituted unity of references. The affinity be-
tween Cantwell Smith and Husserl shows a line of inquiry into the subject 
matter through a speculative phenomenological method that also has two 
practical implications.

First, computation has been dominated by logic and mathematics; 
even for philosophers working on formal ontology, only part of the early 
Husserl has been taken into account, while the later Husserl is denounced 
as being a transcendental idealist.54 In this case, we can even say that 
Cantwell Smith’s critique of dogmatic computational ontology bears such 
a similarity to early Husserl’s phenomenology that it was ignored in com-
puter science. Husserl’s pure seeing was naturalized by cognitive science, 
in what is known as the movement of the “naturalization of phenomenol-
ogy” in the late twentieth century.55 This pure seeing has become the foun-
dation of computation that Cantwell Smith criticized. Formal ontology 
is indebted to this pure seeing or Wesenserschauung, by which the digital 
objects gain their ideal and typological forms. The ideality of the digital 
objects completes the cognitive process of the computation system as a 
whole. In chapter 5, we will see that the later Husserl actually went in al-
most the opposite direction to the early Husserl; his critique of formaliza-
tion as “technization”56 offers a new perspective from which to question 
the objectivity of an object. Second, this affinity with the Husserlian phe-
nomenology or intentionality also opens up to us the whole subsequent 
century of phenomenological inquiry into the existence of objects and in-
tentionality, however, this time also with machines. This tradition, in the 
philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Alfred Schutz, and others, has been able 
to provide alternative understandings and inspirations for computing as 
well as computational culture. Indeed, the shift from the early Husserl to 
the late Husserl and the divergence of Heidegger from the early Husserl 
are significant for our investigation.

From Ontologies to Fundamental Ontology

The philosopher and historian of philosophy Étienne Gilson points out 
that the word ontology is actually a modern term— it first appears in the 
seventeenth century.57 The emergence of the word also corresponds to a 
new understanding of the relation between essence and existence of being. 
According to Gilson, the subject of medieval metaphysics was defined to 
study the question of Being as Being, formulated by Avicenna and then 
endorsed by the theologists of the Latin West. It won’t be our task to elab-
orate on it, as Gilson and Heidegger have already done excellent studies 
on the history of ontology, but it is important to notice that the modern 
concept of ontology originated from a rupture of the perceptions of the 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 97

relation between essence and existence. In Avicenna’s doctrine, existence 
is a predicate of essence. Thomas Aquinas took up the same proposition 
but also departs from there. We can probably say that the way existence 
is added to essence is different in the two doctrines. In Aquinas, it is in 
the act of the creation that “the Being of the creator creates freely a being 
which, as the act of the essence, constitutes an actually existing being.”58 
For Avicenna, “the existence of the finite essence is therefore not an act 
that the creation confers on it  .  .  . but a concomitant that ensues from it, 
or accompanies it.”59 Duns Scotus would later argue against Avicenna and 
Aquinas that there is no real distinction between being and existence. 
What this history of metaphysics adds to our discussion is that the ques-
tion of Being as Being is not homogenous at all, and indeed, it defines 
the general direction of occidental thought. The emergence of ontology, 
which is used quite freely today, more or less came out of the discussion 
on the relation between essence and existence.

In the chapter Aux origines de l’ontologie, Gilson argued that Francisco 
Suárez (1548— 1617) played an important role in preparing the conception 
of ontology in modern philosophy. According to Suárez, ens is at the same 
time a present participle and a nom, however, ens comes from sum, which 
always signifies actual existence. Hence Suárez tends to understand ens as 
a noun that designates essence, the aptitude of existing.60 In such a for-
mulation, being becomes the question of essence, and existence expresses 
the aptitude of essence to exist. Gilson observes that for such an ontol-
ogy, essence exhausts the richness of the being, and “by consequence it 
is legitimate and useful to demonstrate that existence cannot be added to 
the real essence like an actuality of another order.”61 The essentialization of 
being in the school of Suárez prepares being as a scientific subject in which 
existence is not essential. This line of thought was continued in the work 
of Descartes, who was a student of Suárez’s student and also his disciple.

We will turn to Heidegger here, because I think Heidegger’s critique 
of the Cartesian tradition that removed existence from the question of 
Being as Being is probably the most powerful one. Heidegger’s task was 
to restore the question of Being from essentialization, through what he 
terms in Being and Time the fundamental ontology. In comparison, we also 
have Heidegger’s fundamental ontology, which can be used as the basis for 
a critique of Cantwell Smith’s concept of a foundational metaphysics, as 
well as others employed in AI and formal ontology research. Fundamen-
tal ontology triumphed by announcing the end of phenomenology62 and 



98 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

denouncing the existence of a pure ego. Though he didn’t notice that the 
pure ego is implemented in cybernetic machines, Heidegger’s antithesis 
of modern science and technology is actually a testimony against this 
rigorous foundation of all sciences. If we can generalize that Husserlian 
phenomenology is a “rigorous science” with regard to entities (Seiendes), 
then the Heideggerian phenomenology is a “fundamental ontology” aim-
ing to tackle the question of Being (Seinsfrage) to provide a ground that is 
not epistemological but the formal structure of beings as a whole (Dasein 
analytics). Traditional ontologies are characterized by a gaze that is always 
directed from the subject to the object. The validity of the object depends 
on the action “I think,” and the question is, what if the Cartesian ego itself 
is the Achilles’ heel of modern metaphysics? Heidegger’s approach starts 
by trying to determine that which is without presupposition and proposes 
that we are always “being- in- the- world.” Truth is not what is grasped by 
human subjects; rather, it must come from beings themselves.

To follow this path, Heidegger proposes to destroy all ontologies. This 
ambition is intrinsic to Heidegger’s inquiry into the meaning of Being, 
which he found to have been unanswered in the history of philosophy. To 
think Being apart from beings, which are commonly understood in terms 
of “subject- predicates,” Heidegger directly confronts Descartes, as well as 
Edmund Husserl, because Husserl ultimately found his phenomenology 
in Descartes’s res cogito.63 Heidegger’s critique points to a fundamental 
mistake at the foundation of Cartesian ontology. Descartes distinguished 
res cogito from res corporea, or, roughly, “spirit” and “nature.” The substance 
of res corporea can only be grasped through extensions, termed res extensa. 
This is not saying that substance is res extensa, for substance itself is dif-
ficult to address because it doesn’t belong to anything other than itself. 
So substance can only be approached through res extensa, that is, in terms 
of width, length, color, and so on. On the other hand, for Descartes, the 
word substance is inappropriate for describing God, so that in considering 
definitions such as “God is” and “the world is,” the “is” will be required to 
have different senses. Otherwise, being would be univocal, and this would 
imply that “what is created would be viewed as if it were uncreated, or the 
uncreated would be reduced to the status of something created.”64 So the 
meaning of being remains unanswered in the radical separation of God, 
the I, and the world, and the substance of beings in the world can only be 
answered in terms of res extensa. As a result, “something ontical is made 
to underlie the ontological, the expression ‘substantia’ functions some-



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 99

times with a signification which is ontological, sometimes with one which 
is ontical, but mostly with one which is hazily ontico- ontological.”65 This 
foundation of Descartes’s ontology, according to Heidegger, is a fault that 
misses the phenomenality of the ready- to- hand:

[Descartes’s] interpretation and the foundations on which it is 
based have led him to pass over both the phenomenon of the world 
and the Being of those entities within- the- world which are proxi-
mally ready- to- hand.66

This misinterpretation of being as res extensa leads to the problem that 
beings in the world are equated with the present- at- hand. Heidegger’s 
thesis aims to make the phenomenon of the ready- to- hand a challenge to 
Descartes’s ontological foundation of the present- at- hand. In the case of 
the hammer, Dasein doesn’t need a representation of the hammer as a col-
lection of attributes when it uses it to hit the nail. The res extensa of the 
hammer retreats into the background as if it were not important. So the 
totality of the Cartesian interpretation of objects doesn’t hold anymore— 
yet the Cartesian method is so influential that it penetrates into the under-
standing of Dasein as well:

The idea of Being as permanent present- at- hand not only gives 
Descartes a motive for identifying entities within- the- world with 
the world in general, and for providing so extreme a definition of 
their Being; it also keeps him from bringing Dasein’s way of behav-
ing into view in a manner which is ontologically appropriate. . . . 
He takes the Being of “Dasein” (to whose basic constitution Being- 
in- the- world belongs) in the very same way as he takes the Being of 
the res extensa— namely the substance.67

Heidegger’s critique totally rejects the Cartesian method of taking things 
as res extensa. This critique is employed by the American philosopher 
Hubert Dreyfus in his rejection of knowledge representation as used in the 
Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI).68 If AI follows the Cartesian method, 
then its foundation will, according to this argument, obviously be flawed. 
There is another point that is somewhat obscure in these critiques. As 
Heiddegger says, Cartesian ontology can only think about things within 
the definite realm of the entities themselves. That is to say, being doesn’t 



100 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

signify other things, but its substance. Heidegger declared that in the 
Cartesian method, or in ontologies in general in modern metaphysics, 
questions have only been posed concerning beings, but not Being.

Heidegger and the Origin of Gestell

The distinction between Being and beings constitutes what Heidegger calls 
the ontological difference (ontologische Differenz). The ontological differ-
ence also manifests in the differentiation between object (Gegenstand) 
and thing (Ding). The German word for object, Gegenstand, is Christian 
Wolff ’s translation from the Latin ens, which in turn is the subject of on-
tology.69 In so doing, Wolff follows Suárez and takes essence instead of 
existence as the “primary in being and the source of all its operations.”70 
Heidegger shares Gilson’s critique, because for both of them, to inquire 
into the question of existence, it is necessary to get out of such a framework 
of ontology. The translation of ens as Gegenstand for Heidegger character-
izes the problematic of ontology, because it also literally refers to the op-
positional relation between human beings and objects: standing (stehen) 
against (gegen). Objects correspond to an epistemological understanding 
of things, or to their presence. Things, for Heidegger, constitute the exis-
tential structure of being itself, which goes far beyond its appearance and 
functionality, being thematized as formal knowledge. Heidegger’s critique 
of objects starts from his understanding of the constitution of things or 
nature. He asked why Western metaphysics is called metaphysics and an-
swered that this came about because it is essentially grounded in physics, 
or to use the Greek word, physis (φύσις).71 The history of metaphysics is no 
less the history of the determination of Being and truth. Heidegger under-
stands the idea of truth (Aletheia) as the presencing of presence (Anwesen) 
in pre- Socratic Greek thought. This is to be distinguished from another 
mode of presence, which is simply something standing in the present 
“against” us. Heidegger wants to understand the original meaning of pres-
ence as something approaching and, indeed, reaching a human being in 
an ecstatic sense.72 This way of grasping things as presence implies a pro-
cess by which things lose their temporal dimension and are prepared for 
their appropriation by hylomorphism. The separation of form and matter, 
conceived by Aristotle in terms of the process by which a statue is pro-
duced,73 at the same time separates theoria from praxis and poiesis. Theoria 
as productive metaphysics identifies eidos with logos and transmutes itself 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 101

from vita activa into vita contemplativa.74 The misconception of things 
led to a mistaken understanding of production, as thinking expressed in 
acting. This misconception was amplified in the shift from technics to 
technologies. The original sense of technē as related to theoria, praxis, and 
poiesis was also lost in the transformation of knowledge. In The Question 
Concerning Technology (1954), Heidegger tried to identify a break in the 
history of technology, which began in the fifteenth century, splitting technē 
from modern science and technology. Technē, according to Heidegger, in 
ancient Greek thought is also poiesis, a process of bringing forth. Heidegger 
cites the four causes of Aristotle:

(1) the causa materialis, the material, the matter out of which, for 
example, a silver chalice is made; (2) the causa formalis, the form, 
the shape into which the material enters; (3) the causa finalis, the 
end, for example, the sacrificial rite in relation to which the chalice 
required is determined as to its form and matter; (4) the causa 
efficiens, which brings about the effect that is the finished, actual 
chalice, in this instance, the silversmith.75

The first three causes are material correlations, which prepare the way 
for the fourth cause. For example, the chalice is made of silver; its form 
is indebted to the very nature of silver itself and is also responsible for the 
particular setting of the rite. We can rephrase these three causes as matter, 
form, and function. To give another example, that of making a knife, we 
need the material, which is metal, and the form of a knife, and we make 
it according to its function, for example, fighting or chopping or opening 
letters. The three causes apparently correspond to the commonsense view 
of artifact making. The fourth cause, causa efficiens, is not well interpreted 
but, according to Heidegger, is not really the silversmith. The silversmith 
is the one who considers according to the first three causes, but he cannot 
be the fourth cause. Heidegger writes,

To consider carefully [überlegen] is in Greek legein, logos. Legein is 
rooted in apophainesthai, to bring forward into appearance76

This bringing forward into presence is poiesis in Greek, or hervorbringen 
in German. Heidegger continues, “Bringing forth comes to pass only in 
so far as something concealed comes into unconcealment. This coming 



102 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

rests and moves freely within what we call revealing (das Entbergen). The 
Greek has the word Aletheia for revealing.” The final causality bears the sig-
nificance of the possibility of clearing or lighting (Lichtung), in which the 
relation between humans and things comes into the light. The problem of 
modern technology, according to Heidegger, is the result of that which he 
refers to using the concept of the “standing reserve” (Bestand). A stand-
ing reserve denotes a thing defined by the fact that it can be ordered and 
calculated, where even space and time are understood to be mere mea-
surements. The standing reserve is necessarily the foundation of modern 
technology, and it is no surprise that it has its foundation in the concept 
of Gegenstand. The thinking intrinsic to this mode of production is termed 
Gestell by Heidegger, for whom Gestell replaces technē as the essence of 
modern technoscience. Gestell poses violence toward the closure of the 
world. The revival of things requires a return to the question of the world, 
to retrieve the world from its objectification in being restricted to logical 
thinking.

Detachment of Objects and Attachment to the World

Heidegger’s fundamental ontology seems to be something that Cantwell 
Smith’s foundational metaphysics cannot reach, and this allows us to put 
them both into question. We can probably say that for Cantwell Smith 
and for Husserl, the inquiry is primarily to do with the present- at- hand, 
whereas for Heidegger, it is necessary to go further than this mode of 
knowing. How, then, can we understand this difference? We can prob-
ably say that there are different orders of magnitude when we approach 
the present- at- hand and the ready- to- hand. The present- at- hand is closely 
related to forms, because to conceptualize an object, to give it the most 
general form, demands a gaze that extracts its predicates. This is clear 
when we think of the coherence between Aristotle’s Categories and his hy-
lomorphism. The question that remains unclear, and crucially needs to be 
interrogated, is, what are the relations between these two orders of mag-
nitude? One way of looking at this would probably be to claim that they 
function in terms of something like Wittgenstein’s language games, which 
attach the languaging faculty to the world and daily practices. I would like 
to move from here to a discussion of detachment, which is both a detach-
ment of the thought from the world and a detachment of the object from 
the thought. These two detachments meet each other halfway. A compari-



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 103

son between Heidegger and Simondon on the detachment of technical 
objects will clarify this.

For Heidegger, the way of understanding objects through predica-
tion is no longer simply a “point of view” but the totality of thinking 
originated by modern metaphysics. In his 1938 essay “The Age of World 
Picture,” Heidegger describes this totality as “world picture” (Weltbild). 
To Heidegger, what characterizes the world picture is not the picture of 
the world but the world “conceived and grasped as a picture.” Heidegger 
wrote, “The fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the 
world as picture. The word ‘picture’ (Bild) now means the structured 
image (Gebild) that is the creature of man’s producing which represents 
and sets before.”77 The technologies thus invented presuppose this think-
ing as world picture and treat its objects of operation as graspable pictures. 
Thought is detached from the world, because the world is only a picture 
that the mind can contemplate.

Simondon, conversely, sees a detachment of thoughts from objects. 
In Imagination et invention, Simondon showed how the cycle of image 
(perception– mental image– symbols) drives invention. But invention is 
not limited to thoughts; actually, it detaches itself from thoughts when it 
is realized as a technical object. We can even observe that technical objects 
don’t exclusively follow the paths they were supposed to. We can prob-
ably describe this in terms of two detachments. First, the concretization 
of technical objects brings to light some new functions that weren’t part 
of the design. Simondon calls these overabundant functions ( fonctions 
surabondantes).78 This realization in material terms always exceeds the aim 
of invention, which is originally to solve a problem:

It will be partially wrong to say that invention is made to achieve 
an aim, to realize an effect totally predicted in advance. Invention 
is initiated concerning a problem; but the effects of invention are 
more than [dépassent] just resolving the problem.79

Simondon compared this detachment as difference with Marx’s concept 
of surplus value. These surpluses accumulate and modify the milieu ac-
cording to their own logic. The second detachment is when the objects 
reach the hands of their users. These technical objects are then reinscribed 
in the daily lives of users and produce new images and aesthetics, which 
reenter the cycle of images. There is a certain tension between Heidegger’s 



104 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES

emphasis on the totality of thoughts and Simondon’s conception of the 
detachment of objects that cannot be fully grasped by thoughts. We can 
also see that there are two types of amplification in two cycles, namely, 
the cycle of thoughts and the cycle of images as invention. One amplifies 
thinking as the totality of a system; the other amplifies the power of imagi-
nation in invention. It would be difficult to make a simple judgment, say-
ing which is wrong and which is right, because there are different causali-
ties that cannot be viewed as mutually exclusive. If we understand these 
differences as differences of orders of magnitude, then we can probably 
resolve the question with a third term. We may be able to approach it from 
what Heidegger calls being- in- the- world, as this also resonates in some 
ways with Simondon’s concept of detachment, partly because objects in 
the world are always beyond human contemplation.

It may make sense to start the rest of our analysis at the mid— the 
waypoint where the two detachments meet— which is also a third term 
whereby two orders of magnitude are overcome. One of the most char-
acteristic examples of the ready- to- hand in Being and Time is the use of 
a hammer. We use a hammer without taking account of the ideality of its 
appearance and without making it a theme of cognition; rather, we just use 
it. Humans are not actors who merely observe. In this sense, one can claim 
that for Heidegger, everything can be a technical object, or what Graham 
Harman reframes as a “tool- being.”80 What we call here Heidegger’s “tech-
nical objects” are different from Simondon’s technical objects, which are 
more to do with technical knowledge (almost the opposite of the tech-
nical object). Heidegger’s technical objects concern the object’s modes 
of being, which are accessible through Dasein in the world. The world, as 
Heidegger proposes, is the matrix of relations (Bezugszusammenhang).81 
The technical object in the world is also configured by the matrix of re-
lations, which in turn locates the da of Dasein by disclosing the mean-
ingfulness (Bedeutung) situationally. The fundamental question is, does 
the matrix of relations change in different technological systems/worlds? 
And how does this relate to Simondon’s analysis of relations in technical 
ensembles and between human and technical objects? This remains our 
task in this book: to produce a “quantum leap” between these two orders 
of magnitude. Indeed, throughout the rest of this book, I will not situate 
Simondon and Heidegger in opposition to each other but rather will con-
sider them as representatives of different orders of magnitudes. It is easy to 
come to the conclusion that Heidegger’s critique of technology originates 



 DIGITAL OBJECTS AND ONTOLOGIES 105

in an understanding of objects, whereas for Simondon, technology is no 
less than the evolution of objects. In fact, Heidegger and Simondon both 
want to move humans away from the conception of themselves as the cen-
ter of the world.

The two approaches to ontology, or, we can say, the two main approaches 
to the origins of objects— one through the object’s formal structures and 
functionality (ontology), the other through the thing’s self- manifestation 
in everyday life (Ontology)— must work together and guide our investi-
gation. If individualization corresponds to the evolution of ontologies and 
logic, then individuation corresponds to Ontology— a theory of being- in- 
the- world. The individuation of the digital object has to be situated not 
only in the structure of the object itself but also in its exterior surround-
ings, which constitute partly its associated milieu. The associated milieux 
are only possible when we take ontology into consideration and hence are 
able to understand individuation. Posing the question in this way, ontol-
ogy is necessarily technical. And Ontology, if it intends to grasp the modes 
of being of the thing itself, cannot do without its technical nature. I would 
like to reconcile the opposition between these two notions of ontologies as 
well as the opposition between syntax and semantics through a third: that 
of relations. Chapter 3 offers an interpretation of the Bezugszusammenhang 
of digital objects by retrieving the concept of relation in Being and Time 
and its conception in mathematics and information science. Chapter 4 de-
scribes technological evolution according to what I call interobjective rela-
tions and considers how time can be articulated in a technical system.

The Space of Networks

In chapter 1 of this book, I discussed the concept of digital ob-jects as a way of formulating a technical lineage from GSML to the se-
mantic web by following Simondon’s concept of individualization, and in 
chapter 2 I traced the origins of objects in the theories of Cantwell Smith, 
Husserl, and Heidegger to understand the complexity within the con-
cept itself. In this chapter, I propose to understand individuation by re-
trieving and reinterpreting the notion of relation through reading Hei-
degger and Simondon as well as to develop a genealogy from Aristotle 
through medieval philosophy, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Husserl, and Russell 
to recent computational technologies. If we can say that individualiza-
tion implies a progression of form, then individuation subsequently ac-
counts for a transformation in the operation of relations and structures. 
Throughout our analysis so far, we have tried to approach the digital 
object from its form (as in the metadata scheme). Metadata determines 
the object and its beyond, through what I would categorize as “rela-
tions.” The concept of relation has from medieval philosophy until re-
cently been largely underdiscussed since, despite the fact that it has al-
ways been present and has haunted many philosophers. Aristotle cast a 
lot of doubt over it while he was determining his categories. This fueled 
a tendency throughout discussion among medieval philosophers, who 
argued about whether relations are able to be reduced to external ac-
cidents pertaining to the substance or whether relations are monadic 
properties of a sui generis type. Throughout this chapter, I want to ex-
amine the question of “relation” in the context of Heidegger’s Sein und 
Zeit. Then, in chapter 4, I develop the concept “interobjectivity” as a 
parallel reading of Simondon’s speculative history of technology in Du 
mode d’existence des objets techniques to understand the technical prog-
ress of the informational age, especially regarding the concept of a “techni-
cal system.”



110 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

Ready- to- Hand versus Present- at- Hand

Where is the digital object? If we take the computer in front of me as an 
example, than the answer is simple— I point to the machine and say, “It 
is there!” The machine itself occupies space; it informs the user of its ex-
istence via its appearance. The occupied space is both measurable and 
calculable, being amenable to what Kant would call a “pure intuition”— 
allowing the object to be perceived. The question subsequently becomes 
more complicated if we should ask, “What is the space of a digital object 
such as a Facebook profile page or a picture on Flickr?” A digital object is 
on the screen, despite its appearance as a 3D object. But it does not extend 
into physical space, although it appears to “occupy space.” We are able to 
interact with this “space” by using a mouse or by using a finger (if it is a 
touch screen device). There is a space that exists on the screen, which has 
been referred to as cyberspace. The “space” of cyberspace is only signifi-
cant when we consider the appearance of an object, because we will sub-
sequently ask, “Where is this object, and how does it appear to us?” This 
questioning moves us away from the Kantian understanding— because to 
Kant space is something to be occupied; it is intuited, but it is neverthe-
less physical. As Kant said, “if from your experiential concept of a body 
you gradually omit everything that is empirical in a body— the colour, the 
hardness or softness, the weight, even the impenetrability— there yet re-
mains the space that was occupied by the body (which has now entirely 
vanished, and this space you cannot omit [from the concept]).”1 Kant 
attempted to demonstrate that the body occupies a space that does not 
simply vanish with the disappearance of the qualities (i.e., it cannot be 
omitted from the concept of a body itself).

Moreover, as long as the space of a “digital object” is not yet defined as 
a priori, we are unable to articulate the “cyberspace” in terms of the space 
that we inhabit/encounter when using a chair, a computer, or some other 
physical object. When the qualities of a digital object disappear— as when 
we delete them layer by layer within our computers— by the end we find 
there is no longer anything there. If we were to find something remain-
ing, it would likely be some record or trace acknowledging that something 
did exist there previously or perhaps take the form of missing links and 
bugs generated during the course of its disappearance. Is the space of a 
digital object “thinkable”? This question also motivates us to investigate 
further the very concept of space itself. In Being and Time, Heidegger at-
tempted to examine the question of space through a phenomenological 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 111

approach, whereby one is to look beyond the mere appearance of objects 
themselves. Heidegger classifies objects into two categories: those that 
are “present- at- hand” (Vorhandene) and those that are “ready- to- hand” 
(Zuhandene). These two concepts also correspond to ontological differ-
ence as two modes of existence of a technical object. These modes will be 
mentioned frequently throughout the subsequent chapters of this book, 
so we address them thoroughly in this section.

Present- at- hand refers to the mode of apprehending an object themati-
cally and “standing against” it. These forms of objects are intended for sci-
entific investigation. For an engineer, a digital object is no more than some-
thing present- at- hand. The form does not come from nothing, however, 
but from a thematic apprehension, as we already demonstrated in the first 
chapter. The present- at- hand is therefore determined by categories. The 
ready- to- hand, in contrast, corresponds to a completely different mode of 
existence of the object; it has its significance not in the theoretical seeing of 
the object but in what Heidegger calls “dealing” (Umgang). This does not 
mean that there is no “seeing” of the object but that there is a different way 
of “seeing,” which Heidegger calls “circumspection” (Umsicht). We should 
note that “dealing” and “circumspection” share the same prefix um- , mean-
ing “around” in German, as also found in Umwelt, “environment.” So both 
modes point to tarrying (or “hanging around”) somewhere. In “dealing,” 
Dasein works with equipment as if she is at home— that is, having a sense 
of familiarity that Heidegger calls “concern” (Besorgen). Again, we are able 
to identify another play of etymology here, whereby Besorgen comes from 
Sorge (translating into English as both “worry” and “care”). “Concern” 
constitutes a temporality in which Dasein is completely absorbed without 
any self- referential reflection. For example, when we use a hammer, we do 
not necessarily contemplate the hammer itself as an object; we simply use 
it as if the hammer will seek out the nail on its own:

Being- in- the- world, according to our Interpretation hitherto, 
amounts to a non- thematic circumspective absorption in refer-
ences or assignments constitutive for the readiness- to- hand of a 
totality of equipment. Any concern is already as it is, because of 
some familiarity with the world.2

We should also understand the significance of ready- to- hand as a chal-
lenge against the ignorance regarding the mode of existence of technical 



112 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

objects exhibited throughout the history of philosophy (as we discussed 
in the introduction). Heidegger’s phenomenology is distinguished from 
Husserl’s precisely in that Heidegger departs from the eidos of the technical 
object toward its actual modes of being. The phenomenological approach 
thereby becomes a concern, not with capturing the ideality of objects, 
but with Dasein’s being- in- the- worldness. This involves a changing of two 
fundamental concepts within phenomenology, namely, the phenomeno-
logical reduction and intentionality. In Part I, we saw that, together, the re-
duction and intentionality compose the essential method for attaining the 
apodeictic evidence of an object as per Husserl’s phenomenology. In The 
Basic Problems of Phenomenology, Heidegger developed his own version:

For us phenomenological reduction means leading phenomeno-
logical vision back from the apprehension of a being, whatever may 
be the character of that apprehension to the understanding of the 
being of this being.3

For Husserl, phenomenological reduction presupposes a transcendental 
reduction that demands a transcendental ego in a Cartesian sense. The ego 
is the pole from which intentionality is directed toward the object. And 
in being conscious of the ego’s intentional movement, it is able to exclude 
all presupposition and irrelevant detail about the object from needing to 
be investigated. Heidegger’s concern is not with the ego’s reduction but 
rather with hermeneutic reflection on the being “in”; that is to say, in-
stead of an act of distancing oneself from the object, his gesture is to start 
from the being from within. So in the Husserlian phenomenology, reduc-
tion is the condition of possibility of an investigation of intentionality. 
Intentionality, as a phenomenological method, presupposes the necessity 
of distance, whereas for Heidegger, such a distance must be eliminated to 
understand the world. Instead, Heidegger argues that intentionality must 
presuppose a “being- in”:

Intentionality is not an extant relation between an extant subject 
and an extant object but is constitutive for the relational character 
of the subject’s comportment as such. As a structure of subject- 
comportment, it is not something immanent to the subject which 
would then need supplementation by a transcendence; instead 
transcendence hence intentionality, belongs to the nature of the 
entity that comports itself intentionally.4



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 113

Evidently both phenomenological reduction and intentionality for Hei-
degger have an ontological sense or relation to the world, not as an en-
tity, but as significations. Therefore the mode of being of technical objects 
constitutes Dasein’s concernful being, occupying most parts of Dasein’s 
everyday life. However, Dasein’s tarrying with technical objects may break 
down, following their potential failure. The concernful mode will stop 
once Dasein is exposed to a defamiliarized environment. As broken equip-
ment is transformed into something present- at- hand, Dasein acquires a 
sense of being uncanny. The concernful being of Dasein underlines the 
condition of possibility of a genuine experience of space (in contradis-
tinction to the measurable entity of Cartesian coordination). This would 
mean that space is an “in,” albeit not an entity that is merely observed. 
This being so, what would characterize this “in” in terms of both space and 
ready- to- hand?

Technical Objects, Signs, and Space

This inevitably leads us to consider Heidegger’s interpretation of the to-
tality of references (Verweisungsganzheiten) as the condition of possibility 
of the ready- to- handness of equipment. A technical object belongs to the 
“equipmental totality” of the in- order- to (um zu). The “in order to” de-
scribes equipment’s being- for something, which Heidegger also calls its 
reference (Verweisung): thus when the hammer finds the nail through the 
activity of hammering, it “references” the nail, as that to which its being- 
for refers. Yet the reference is not a singular line from A to B but rather 
always signifies other references, for example, hammering signifies the ref-
erence of the nail and then the object we are working on, for example, a 
table. This is why he identifies a totality of references— because each is 
ultimately connected to, or “references,” all the others. So the “in” must be 
assessed through an interpretation of reference.

The “in” also has another meaning, not that of “being in” but of the 
“in itself ” (an sich). Phenomenology’s mission to go “back to things them-
selves” confronts Kant’s idea of the thing- in- itself (Ding an sich) as a 
priori unknowable. For the philosophers of German idealism, such as 
Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, this unknowable constituted a problem to 
be clarified and resolved. Instead of following this path, Husserl simply 
denounced the thing- in- itself as mysterious. He argued that a thing can 
always be known or understood within the cognitive capacity of humans, 
which is the purpose of the phenomenological method. Heidegger also 



114 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

proposed the in- itself as knowable but never understood it as being ontic 
knowledge; instead, he considered the thing- in- itself to be a matter of 
ontological knowledge. This knowledge, he argued, can only be attained 
through the interpretation of the ready- to- hand:

As long as we take our orientation primarily and exclusively from 
the present- at- hand, the “in- itself ” can by no means be ontologi-
cally clarified.5

The totality of reference is a theory of sign and signification. The ready- to- 
handness is not a property of the equipment but only becomes accessible 
from within the understanding of its reference to other entities that con-
stitute Dasein’s concernful being. This is one aspect of hermeneutic logic, 
that there is always already something being presupposed. Circumspection 
is not knowledge, but rather one of the consequences of fore- knowledge: 
“it is in the ‘there’ before anyone has observed or ascertained it. It is it-
self inaccessible to circumspection, so far as circumspection is always di-
rected towards entities.”6 I would like to take a departure here to present 
an understanding Heidegger’s interpretation of signs in two ways: (1) to 
understand the sign structure as an important aspect of the Umwelt, which 
conditions Dasein’s everyday acts, and (2) to show that Heidegger also 
undermines the analysis of relations, subsequently advocating instead the 
Vorstruktur as an ambiguous unity of knowledge.

Heidegger’s theory of the sign in Being and Time is a continuation of 
Husserl’s discussion of “Indication and Expression” in Logical Investigations, 
conceived as “supplements to Husserl’s investigation  .  .  . the orientation 
there being toward principles.”7 The significance of Husserl’s contribution 
will be further discussed and reinterpreted in chapter 5 of this book, but 
to introduce it briefly here, Husserl distinguishes two types of significa-
tion: marks/signs, on one hand, and expression, on the other. According 
to Husserl, signs signify through a passive association. Upon grasping the 
sign or mark, we do not thematize the sign itself, but rather we respond as 
if we have been programmed. Expressions are different from signs because 
they have meanings. The word “meaning” must be carefully interpreted 
here, as Husserl does not say that a sign has no signification (Bedeutung) 
but rather that the sign is something we instantly recognize without requir-
ing a process of meaning explication and meaning fulfilment.8 Heidegger’s 
contribution seems to prioritize the indication as opposed to the expres-



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 115

sion, because the automatic and instant synthesis points to the ready- to- 
hand. We can see this in Heidegger’s definition of a sign as

not a thing which stands to another thing in the relationship of 
indicating; . . . [it is] rather an item of equipment which explic-
itly raises an equipmental whole into our circumspection so that 
together with it the worldly character of the available announces 
itself.9

Indication juxtaposes the equipmental whole, just as a reference from A 
to B connects to an entire network of relations. A sign loses itself within 
the concernful being as an entity, which cannot be defined without taking 
into account the whole background. The background (or the totality of 
reference) is the worldness of the world.10 Hence Heidegger writes that 
“the relationship of the ‘with . . . in . . .’ shall be indicated by the term ‘as-
signment’ or ‘reference.’ ”11 By the same token, if we understand space as 
something present- at- hand, we will lose the ontological understanding 
of it. Heidegger argues that “space is not in the subject, nor is the world 
in space.”12 This statement constitutes a paradox: first as our perception 
of space is not a denial of reality, because the object is not solely in the 
mind but also in the world, and second in that space is not a container 
that contains reality— so that an object is therefore instantly somewhere 
in between being mind- dependent and mind- independent. This para-
dox produces two subsequent questions: What is the genuine relation 
between space and object? and What is the place of the human subject? 
The first question reapproaches the Kantian idea of space, because Kant 
emphasizes the fact that space cannot be seen merely as a container but 
is itself the a priori condition of understanding, which he calls the “pure 
intuition.” The term “pure” for Kant means a priori, something that cannot 
be derived from empirical experience. Therefore space for Kant is both 
objective and subjective. Kant’s question is, what is the condition of pos-
sibility that allows the objective (in the sense of being an object) to re-
main objective (in a scientific formal sense) in the subjective experience? 
Heidegger’s question, conversely, is significantly different. He approaches 
the question on another level by asking, what is the condition of possibil-
ity of the experience of space itself? And his solution is that space must 
presuppose a world, hence he resolves the paradox by assigning it a new 
ontological meaning:



116 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

Space is not to be found in the subject, nor does the subject ob-
serve the world “as if ” that world were in a space; but the “subject” 
(Dasein), if well understood ontologically, is spatial. And because 
Dasein is spatial in the way we have described, space shows itself 
as a priori.13

So to talk about space is actually to discuss spatiality, which is a comport-
ment toward the world. Intentionality becomes situational; it is not di-
rected from the subject to the object but arises from Dasein’s being “in.” 
When it comes to a digital object, as we discussed earlier, we are not able 
to refer to space, because this space is a mere perception— for example, a 
3D object does not occupy the physical space despite being determined by 
the understanding of physical space as having x, y, z coordinates assigned 
to the object (the value of the z axis can be much deeper than the thick-
ness of the screen). For example, the method we use of sliding our finger 
across the screen of an iPhone to see the next picture produces the illusion 
that that there is a space beyond both sides of a picture. So it becomes im-
possible to grasp the spatiality of a digital object by attempting to record 
its dimensions or trying to reduce it to something on a screen that can 
be measured indirectly. What is more important here is to look beyond 
the spatial appearance of the digital object to spatiality as reference. As 
Heidegger put it,

when space is discovered non- circumspectively by just looking 
at it, the environmental regions get neutralized to pure dimen-
sions. . . . The “world,” as a totality of equipment ready- to- hand, 
becomes spatialized [verräumlicht] to a context of extended things 
which are just present- at- hand and nothing more.14

That is to say, to understand a digital object, we should approach “cyber-
space” as a totality of reference (i.e., its being- in- the- world). What is the 
being- with of a digital object? Is it the screen, the keyboard, the mouse, 
other entities on the screen, the operating system, or the hardware .  .  . ? 
Such answers remain very general, because in this totality of relations, we 
can include almost everything in the environment as objects. If we were to 
stop our inquiry here, we could say no more than saying “nothing” at this 
point. This is exactly the problem Heidegger encountered.



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 117

Heidegger’s Interpretation of Relations?

How could our analysis go further than this general idea of totality as 
being- in- the- world? Unfortunately, we cannot find any direct hints in Hei-
degger, because he actually denounced the analysis of relations in Being 
and Time. His denunciation allows him to propose a radical understanding 
of temporality as care toward the ontological understanding of things. On 
the other hand, however, such an abstraction also blinded him from see-
ing the dynamics of ontological difference. To demonstrate this clearly, we 
must first go back to what Heidegger calls a relation (Beziehung), leading 
him to reject any further analysis of the concept of relations:

Referring is, if we take it as formally as possible, a relating. But rela-
tion doesn’t function as a genus for “kinds” or “species” of refer-
ences which may somehow become differentiated as sign, symbol, 
expression, or signification. A relation is something quite formal 
which maybe read off directly by way of “formalization” from any 
kind of context, whatever its subject- matter or its way of Being.15

Heidegger rejects relation as being something too formal and general to 
provide a concrete meaning for reference. For Heidegger, relation is a 
superset, within which we have a subset called references, within which 
we find indications (Zeigung) as a further subset of references. We should 
therefore proceed from the concept of relation to its subsets— the refer-
encing of equipment and the indication of signs:

Every reference is a relation, but not every relation is a reference. 
Every “indication” is a reference, but not every referring is an 
indicating. This implies at the same time that every “indication” is a 
relation, but not every relation is an indicating. The formally general 
character of relation is thus brought to light. If we are to investigate 
such phenomena as references, signs, or even significations, nothing 
is to be gained by characterizing them as relations. Indeed we shall 
eventually have to show that “relations” themselves, because of their 
formally general character, have their ontological source in a reference.16

How could relation be explained by its reference (i.e., a superset by its 
subset)? This is nevertheless a riddle, an interesting logical question that 



118 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

constitutes the core of Heidegger’s hermeneutic thinking. We can engage 
with and understand Heidegger’s proposal by thinking of being- in- the- 
world as the foundation of all discourse, therefore any form of relation al-
ways presupposes the world. But because we cannot then attain any clarity 
of being- in- the- world— unless it remains a mystery— then the “in- itself ” 
would be unknown. Science addresses the formalization of relations, 
while for Heidegger an existential analysis must find its point of depar-
ture somewhere else, and this is the temporal analysis. The totality of ref-
erence is also a temporal structure of being there. In History of the Concept of 
Time, we read,

Circumspection oriented to the presence of what is of concern pro-
vides each setting- to- work procuring, and performing with the way 
to work it out, the means to carry it out, the right occasion, and the 
appropriate time. This sight of circumspection is the skilled pos-
sibility of concerned discovery.17

Being “skilled” is a consequence of time, according to Heidegger. He 
responded to traditional ontologies by arguing that beings (Seiendes) 
should be understood through time. I would argue here that his analy-
sis is partially correct because it only belongs to one order of magnitude 
specific to the phenomenological tradition. The problem we identified, 
however, is the question of beings, or the given. We have emphasized that 
treating a technical object as though it were an apple on a table is not only 
a mistake but also a risk. Heidegger is therefore plausible when examin-
ing the mode of existence of technical objects, but like Husserl, he did 
not concern himself with how Dasein becomes absorbed in the world. 
This givenness, in the Heideggerian sense, also disguises what he calls the 
“founding steps”:

I can at any time perceive natural things in their bodily presence di-
rectly, that is, without running through the founding steps before- 
hand, because it belongs to the sense of being- in- the- world to be in 
these founding steps constantly and primarily. I have no need to go 
through them because Dasein which founds perceiving, is nothing 
but the way of being of these very founding steps, as concerned 
absorption in the world.18



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 119

Husserl and the Problem of Givenness

Heidegger’s reluctance to approach the founding steps comes out of what 
we may consider a general attitude prescribed by phenomenology. This 
attitude is already present in the literal meaning of phenomenology, which 
tends to be reluctant to speculate beyond the phenomenon. We could 
also understand this as a difference of orders of magnitude. Indeed, we 
encounter here a similar problem regarding Husserl’s argument concern-
ing the givenness of data. This hypothesis also resonates with Michel 
Henry’s critique of Husserl’s mistreatment of givenness and Heidegger’s 
interpretation of phenomenology. In his book Material Phenomenology, 
Henry argues that Husserl did not do justice to what he calls the “hyletic 
data” (meaning sense data), and the appearance of objects, which he de-
noted as “givenness.” Givenness has two senses: (1) the mysterious sensa-
tion (Empfindung)— a “type of givenness and given in which the mode of 
givenness is itself the given”— and (2) the constitution of the noetic acts. 
Henry argues that “transcendental phenomenology, as intentional, is lim-
ited to the description of this second givenness, to the analysis of its essen-
tial modes and the various types of noesis and noema corresponding to it.”19

This means that Husserl leaves the how and why of givenness unexam-
ined, as he perceived the first givenness simply as given; that is, sense data 
are given automatically upon every encounter. We may recall here our dis-
cussion at the beginning of chapter 1 of the Latin root of data, as the plural 
form of datum, meaning “the given.” Husserl uses two words, datum and 
Gegebenheit; however, there is little distinction made, and in the interpreta-
tion of Husserl, notably in Suzanne Bachelard’s A Study of Husserl’s Formal 
and Transcendental Logic, she translated them into the same French word, 
donnée, used for both “data” and “the given.”20 Now besides the hyletic 
data as given, we also have another (or the third) givenness that comes 
out of a technical ensemble (later we will see that it is a technical system) 
including censors, interfaces, algorithms, databases, networks, and so on. 
The problem arising here is that the transcendence of an object is pulled 
down to the immanence of consciousness, and consequently, the interac-
tion between objects and subjects is reduced to two simple modes: passive 
and active. The passive mode of seeing is also what Husserl named the 
“pre- predicative moment”— for example, when first entering the room, 
the room is given to me as a passive seeing before I adjust my inten-
tion to focus on a specific object. This room as a background for further 



120 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

investigation is the primary givenness. In his 1907 lectures (later edited as 
a book, The Idea of Phenomenology), Husserl understood the active mode 
of seeing as the process of explication, which bears with it the complexity 
of noetic acts. These two modes of seeing also distinguish Husserl from 
Hume and genetic phenomenology from the association of ideas. For 
Hume, consciousness is a correspondence of factual reality, while Husserl 
suspends “factual reality” and defines it as an “immanent term whose 
being- sense depends on consciousness.”21 For Husserl, a sign is based on 
the principle of a Humean association of ideas, which is nevertheless for 
Husserl too passive— a “senseless bundle of/or collection of data.”22 The 
superiority of active seeing over the passive mode exposes the weakness of 
the Husserlian phenomenology. As Henry writes,

intentional phenomenology is transcendental phenomenology, but 
the transcendental reduced to the intentional noesis is not truly a 
transcendental, an a priori condition of all possible experience, if it 
always requires what is wholly other than itself: the sensation, the 
impression. The latter must first be given in order for any experi-
ence whatsoever to take place.23

So the problem we are coming up against is how we can make sense of this 
“other than itself ” and the “founding steps.” Husserl cannot accept this 
“other than itself ” as the constitution of subjectivity, because it renders the 
cogito impure. Henry’s prompting to tackle the question of first givenness 
and first immanence can be further understood in two broader senses. 
First, sense data weren’t properly addressed in Husserl’s phenomenology 
but were rather subsumed to the active explication of the cogito. Second, 
givenness— the occurrence of the object as a phenomenon— is not ques-
tioned, except in terms of the transcendental reduction. The source of 
this ignorance on the part of phenomenology in general comes from the 
order of magnitude. And to resolve this question, we need to look into 
another order of magnitude and attempt to resolve this difference by rein-
troducing the concept of relation. It is significant that modern technology, 
through the appropriation and modification of the “founding steps” and 
“other than itself,” reconstitutes our experiences, including time. We can 
then follow two paths in approaching the subject matter: (1) the empirical 
and logical tradition— especially in David Hume’s philosophy of relation 
and Bertrand Russell’s relational calculus, and (2) concerning Husserl and 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 121

Heidegger’s interpretation of temporality as the primordial relation. These 
two lines of thinking can also be considered examples of “ontological dif-
ference.” Ultimately, we will be able to say that this ontological difference 
corresponds to a difference of two orders of magnitude.

Aristotle’s Dilemma of the Relative and Medieval Interpretations

The theory of relations is always undermined because of its generality, 
as proclaimed by Heidegger. Yet it has always been indecisively thought, 
since the beginning of Aristotelian philosophy. In chapter 7 of Categories, 
Aristotle first identifies relation as one of the following ten categories: 
substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, posture, state, action, 
and undergoing (in the sense of being affected). The category we translate 
as “relation” was named by Aristotle ta pros ti (τὰ πρός τι), which literally 
means “things toward something.”24 Aristotle became rather indecisive 
about this particular category, because a comprehensive definition did not 
seem possible. In later chapters, Aristotle continued to add another five re-
lational categories, namely, opposition, priority, simultaneity, motion, and hav-
ing. What is it exactly that makes relation so difficult to define? He gives the 
following definition:

those things are called relative which, being either said to be of 
something else or related to something else, are explained by refer-
ence to the other thing.25

He went on to explain different types of relations in terms of reciprocity 
and spontaneity. Hence, if we follow the logic of Aristotle, we can derive 
the following three conclusions: (1) relations are items that relate to sub-
stance, (2) the items that relate to substances are accidents, and (3) no 
substance is a relation.26 In Metaphysics V 15, Aristotle discussed again the 
question of relation, where he classifies three types of relations, including 
(1) identical relations (e.g., double to half, treble to a third); (2) causal 
relations (e.g., between action and passion, to heat and being heated); and 
(3) psychological relations (e.g., measure to measured being).27 In both 
occasions, the relation between substance and relatives remains obscure. 
A question stands out: is substance relative at all? Aristotle has doubted in 
Categories, because, for example, beings such as man and horse can be de-
fined without referent to others, but for some secondary substance, such 



122 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

as head and hand, they may not exist on their own. However, because we 
know that a substance is “neither said of a subject nor in a subject,”28 it will 
be problematic if there are cases in which they are relative. For the sec-
ond question, if we can consider that A is whiter than B, then is “whiter” a 
predicate belonging to a subject that is neither A nor B, or it is also a real 
being? The second question was notably raised by Henry of Ghent.29 By 
the end of his section on the “relative” in Categories, Aristotle left the inter-
pretation open- ended:

Indeed, if our definition of that which is relative was complete, 
it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove that no substance is 
relative. If however, our definition was not complete, if those things 
are only properly called relative in the case of which relation to an 
external object is a necessary condition of existence, perhaps some 
explanation of the dilemma may be found.30

This dilemma remained a puzzle for centuries and generations to come. 
Boethius (circa a.d. 480– 524 or 525), a translator of Aristotle’s Categories 
into Latin, thus proposed it as task for the philosophy community:

Aristotle would never have said this if he were not prompting us to 
further reflection and to even greater exercise of subtlety. Because 
of his exhortation, we shall not hesitate in the least to raise [fur-
ther] questions and offer [our own] solutions to them in other 
places.31

The question concerning the nature of relation concerned almost every 
philosophers: Avicenna, Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, Henry of 
Ghent, Duns Scotus, and so on,32 in the process of the establishment of an 
onto- theology that combines Aristotelian metaphysics with the science of 
divine. The nature of relation is particularly interesting for the theologians, 
because it is closely related to the trinitarian question, to explain “how in 
god the persons are identical with the divine essence, yet different among 
themselves.”33 Even though the answers are largely theological, their philo-
sophical contributions shouldn’t be overlooked. Here two inquiries con-
cern us that I summarize as follows: (1) Is substance relative at all? (2) Is 
relation a real being? The first question is normally refused. It can be said 
to be relative to something else, but it is self- substantial, because if sub-



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 123

stance is relative, then it means the divine essence that creates it can also 
be relative. This question is hence not valid because it disapproves God. 
This question wasn’t discussed until the arrival of the skepticism of Hume, 
which we will elaborate later. The other question is whether relation is a 
thing that exists independently, namely, whether it has its own substantial 
being. These two questions are tantamount to two kinds of interpretation: 
(1) relation according to speech (relationes secundum dici) and (2) relation 
according to nature and being (relationes secundum esse).

For the first interpretation, relation is a pure “toward something else” 
that has its foundation on accidents and is determined by the intellect. 
For example, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, the relation “taller- than” is 
nothing but the manifestation of other predicates, such as tallness. We can 
probably follow Brower and call this interpretation a reductionist reading. 
Avicenna defines relation as “that the quiddity of which is said with re-
spect to another thing.”34 Avicenna further defined three types of relations, 
according to the way a relation is perceived: (1) need two extreme terms, 
(2) need only one term, or (3) none of them (e.g., left– right). We can under-
stand that Avicenna didn’t want to inquire into the substantial being of 
relation, because for him existence is an accident of essence, and hence 
being as such is already determined by the essence. It is worth noting that 
Avicenna doesn’t understand accident according to the Aristotelian cate-
gories but rather as a list of “predicables” (prédicables), for example, genre, 
species, difference, proper, and accident.35

Following Avicenna, Henry of Ghent rejected that “relatedness toward” 
can be called res having its own quiddity. He has hence reformulated the 
question: it is not of the thing toward something but of the being toward 
something, not as res but as a mode of being. Other than a substantial and 
accidental being, there is a relational being.36 Decorte interprets that for 
Henry of Ghent, relation is a mode of being: “it will be the nature or the 
essence itself that will determine whether or not this relational being will 
be present.  .  .  . In other words, this relational being will depend on the 
essence being ordered, by its own nature, towards something else.”37 This 
reading of Henry of Ghent is already a bit different from Avicenna’s, be-
cause it affirms the existence of a relational being that is extramental.

Henry’s interpretation of relation comes out of his critique of Giles de 
Rome, who represents what Brower calls nonreductionist or realist read-
ing. For the realist, a concept must have its extramental existence. Hence, 
for the realist, they ask besides of its esse accidentis and ratio generis. Is there 



124 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

a res for relation? Theologians and philosophers such as Giles de Rome, 
Albert the Great, and John Duns Scotus wanted to understand relations as 
a sui generis monadic type,38 existing on its own terms, and even as a thing. 
For example, if Simmias did not exist and Socrates were the only human 
in the world, relations such as “taller- than” and “shorter- than” would still 
exist. For the reductionists like Ockham, relations naturally become prod-
ucts of the mind, which then manifest themselves in speech. What the 
reductionists and the nonreductionists have in common is that they all 
regard substance as the ultimate reality, because it is used to explain the re-
lation with the divine essence. But if we then speculate further, the second 
relation here (relationes secundum esse), according to Heidegger, prompts 
us to ask, “what if esse is understood here as Being (Sein) instead of being?” 
and “what if the dici and esse belong together?”39 We cannot provide an 
immediate answer to these questions but will continue to address them 
throughout the remainder of this book, because they may only be clarified 
through the several paths of inquiry we have yet to follow.

This same question of relation was further developed by the British 
Empiricists. For example, as identified by Alexius Meinong, John Locke’s 
theory of knowledge is actually a theory of relations.40 However, for Locke, 
relation was still simply an idea that “the mind gets from . . . comparison.”41 
I believe that it is rather in the thought of David Hume that relations gain 
their proper philosophical position. The theory of relations that we want 
to retrieve in this book should also serve as a critique of the substance 
fetishism of Western metaphysics.42 Heidegger did not make his critique 
explicit, but we will see that Heidegger later gave up his inquiry into sub-
stance, disclosing it instead as a question of temporality. Modern technol-
ogy, in my view, still insists on the question of substance. For example, 
the term substance is still often dogmatically used within formal ontology 
in information processing, while its actual meaning has already silently 
disappeared. I am not going to reuse the interpretation of the medieval 
philosophers (the relationes secundum dici and relationes secundum esse ap-
proaches), because they all assume the existence of substance and treat 
relations as predicates of it. I would rather make a distinction between 
discursive relations and existential relations. The discursive relation is 
similar to what Heidegger calls “formalization” or what Simondon calls 
“individualization,” and the existential relation is similar to Heidegger’s 
interpretation of temporality and what Simondon terms “individuation.” 
It will be our task in what follows to demonstrate how these two concepts 
correspond to our analysis of the existence of digital objects.

Hume’s Critique of the Aristotelian Substance– Accident Pairing

The insufficiency of the substance– accident pair has limited the under-
standing of things over centuries. Rodolphe Gasché, in his book Of Minimal 
Things, has suggested that “to a large extent, the emergence of a logic of 
relations in the last century results from the insight that the substance/
accident ontology significantly limits the analysis of relation.”43 Gasché 
was referring to Bertrand Russell’s logical atomism, yet we may observe 
that this discovery itself owes much to the legacy of British Empiricism, 
especially David Hume’s atomism.44 In the spirit of skepticism, Hume’s 
first move was to destroy the concept of subject– predicate. He classifies 
our concepts of things into two categories: one is “impression” and the 
other is “idea.” Impression, for Hume, is the immediate evidence of the 
existence of things, and it is also the source of all ideas. He distinguishes 
two kinds of impressions: “impressions of perception” (which still maintain 
the vividness of what is perceived within the mind) and “impressions of 
reflection” (which are affects like sadness or being hungry). An “idea” can 
roughly be considered to be a faint impression. So our knowledge should 
be grounded within these two forms of impressions. Hume began his ar-
gument by saying that because no one will “assert, that substance is either 
a colour, or sound, or a taste,” the “idea of substance must therefore be 
derived from an impression of reflection, into our passions and emotions.” 
Yet against this possibility, he then argued that “none of [these passions 
and emotions] can possibly represent a substance,” concluding that “we 
have therefore no idea of substance, distinct from that of a collection of 
particular qualities, nor have we any other meaning when we talk or rea-
son concerning it.”45

Therefore, what is an object if it is not to be conceived in terms of sub-
stance and predicates? Hume argued that it should be understood in terms 
of relations. Hume’s theory of relations is one of the least explored aspects 
of his philosophy, though his idea of association is well recognized as an 
important contribution to philosophy. Hume’s philosophy of association 
is known as the psychology of association, according to which relations 
are the effects of associations. Our immediate reaction may be to ask, 
isn’t relation simply the principle of association? But in fact they need to 
be carefully distinguished. If relation is the effect of association, then it 
is entirely dependent on association (i.e., a posteriori), whereas if it were 
the principle of association itself, it would be the a priori condition. For 
Hume, association cannot be an a priori synthesis, which is exactly what 



126 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

Kant had found it necessary to argue for.46 Hume’s understanding of rela-
tion had been seriously underappreciated until midway through the last 
century, when Gilles Deleuze addressed it in his first book, Empiricism and 
Subjectivity,47 in which he claimed to have found in Hume the novelty of 
external relations. It is believed that from both Hume and medieval phi-
losophy, Deleuze developed his idea that “being” is univocal and can thus 
be expressed in only one way, which is that of relations.48 Again, this no-
tion of relation is ontological as opposed to being merely ontic or psycho-
logical.49 Hume rejected Aristotle’s categories, and most important, in my 
view, he first rejected the idea of substance and, second, radicalized rela-
tions as being the foundation of propositions. After rejecting substance, 
Hume went on to argue that “the idea of a substance as well as that of a 
mode, is nothing but a collection of simple ideas, that are united by the 
imagination, and have a particular name assigned to them, by which we are 
able to recall, either to ourselves or others, that collection.”50 We may say 
now that substance is simply an idea of the collection of all properties. In 
other words, substance is a fiction that presupposes relations. Therefore, 
when we look at an object, the properties can be isolated as abstractions or 
as simple ideas. Hume makes the following statement:

We consider the figure and color together, since they are in ef-
fect the same and undistinguishable; but still view them in dif-
ferent aspects, according to the resemblances, of which they are 
susceptible.51

This is a somewhat radical approach to both substances and predicates, as 
predicates belong to substance. So once Hume rejects substance, he must 
also reject predicates as the predicates of substance. In other words, he 
must look for another definition of predicate. This new definition of predi-
cate can be found in the idea of relations. This does not mean that predicates 
are relations but rather that predicates presuppose relations, for example, rela-
tion is its mode of being. Hume did not, however, reject all presuppositions 
about predication. For example, if an apple is red, redness is the quality of 
the apple, and this can hardly be contradicted. But as the preceding quo-
tation implies, the unification of an apple in the understanding requires 
two steps. First, the mind cannot demonstrate the necessary connection 
between the roundness of the apple and its redness; they are simple ideas 
given by impressions. This indicates that they did not originate from the 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 127

substance of the apple but as something dispersed through space and time 
and reaching us passively via the gaze. Second, redness is red because it 
is neither green nor blue, as the roundness is round because it is neither 
square nor oval. This means that the predicates already presuppose com-
parison, that is, relations. So the idea of an apple is based on two levels of 
relations: (1) relations of resemblance, for example, whereby the redness 
and the roundness are different from greenness and squareness, and (2) re-
lations of contiguity— because of their temporal and spatial co presence, 
roundness and redness are unified within the single idea of a red apple. 
Whenever a new property of the object is discovered, a relation will subse-
quently need to be disclosed. The new property will become unified with 
the “idea of the substance.” In the example of gold, Hume demonstrates 
that the idea of gold “may at first be a yellow colour, weight, malleable-
ness, fusibility; but upon the discovery of its dissolubility in aqua regia, 
we join that to the other qualities, and suppose it to belong to the sub-
stance as much as if its idea had from the beginning made a part of the 
compound one.”52

Husserl’s “Radical Interpretation” of Hume

We have now moved halfway beyond substantial fetishism. We still need 
to address the question of where the associations end and the object be-
gins. Husserl’s critique of Hume can help to clarify this point, whereby 
we can also identify Husserl’s influence on Heidegger when considering 
the latter’s rejection of a theory of relations (i.e., Husserl’s departure from 
Hume’s associationism to a temporal understanding of cognitive process, 
of genesis). Husserl made a similar interpretation of Hume’s relations 
in the Logical Investigations, which Richard Murphy has called a “radical 
interpretation.” However, according to Murphy, Husserl totally rejected 
Hume’s idea, because Hume “has involved himself in an infinite regress.”53 
Accordingly, if the color, shape and other properties were to be denied 
“real immanence in the phenomenal object as a whole, recourse to resem-
blance and attention is in vain.”54 In other words, to arrive at an idea of 
the object, one would have to go on drawing comparisons ad infinitum. 
Murphy further suggested that Husserl’s radical interpretation is not valid, 
because it misunderstands what Hume had originally meant.55 Murphy 
argues that Hume identified abstract moments with “modes,” as “modes 
are simple ideas which represent qualities found in different objects or, if 



128 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

found in the same object, do not give rise to complex ideas.” He therefore 
sees Husserl’s radical interpretation of Hume as a misreading. Let us have a 
look at what Hume wrote about modes, following the example of the gold 
as described earlier:

That this cannot take place in modes, is evident from considering 
their nature. The simple ideas of which modes are formed, either 
represent qualities, which are not united by contiguity and causa-
tion, but are dispersed in different subjects; or if they be all united 
together, the uniting principle is not regarded as the foundation of 
the complex idea.56

What Hume actually meant was that modes cannot be unified through 
contiguity and causation. When we talk about the quality of the object, 
these simple ideas are “at least supposed to be closely and inseparably con-
nected by the relations of contiguity and causation.”57 Here Hume actually 
assigns different roles to different relations; for example, if resemblance 
is the relation that distinguishes the properties perceived of a subject, 
then it must also employ the relations of contiguity and causality to allow 
a unification of the object. Husserl’s critique of the infinite comparison 
sounds very logical at first glance; however, Husserl himself did not take 
into account the presupposition of Hume’s empiricism. This can in fact be 
resolved (1) by the limitations on the knowledge the subject is able to ac-
quire, which is indeed a computational question, and (2) by the provision 
that, when the sample pool grows too large, the numbers of comparisons 
can be reduced via the habits the subject develops in her daily life, because 
the relation of resemblance is transformed into the relation of causality. 
The second point corresponds to Hume’s very famous skepticism regard-
ing the necessity of causal relations. This is a topic to which we shall return 
at a later stage of this chapter.

In fact, whether Husserl’s interpretation is right or wrong is not crucial 
here. We should certainly take Husserl’s skepticism further than current 
technical understandings. The difference between Husserl’s active model 
and Hume’s passive model lies less in the association of ideas than in the 
temporal process of the formation of ideas. The passive association of ideas 
cannot constitute the temporal experience of the ego, that is to say, its in-
tentionality, without which there is no time. Hence Husserl’s theory of re-
lations is not atomism in the Humean sense but rather a theory of tempo-
rality that he had already previously demonstrated in the Phenomenology 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 129

of Internal Time Consciousness.58 We might ask whether one can find in 
atomism the possibility of rediscovering a theory of relations equivalent 
to that which was proposed by Aristotle at the very beginning. However, 
we would subsequently encounter the difference between the orders of 
granularities, which we have discussed. And even if we have rediscovered 
an earlier theory of relations, the salient question is still, how would it suf-
fice as the foundational understanding of digital objects? What would be 
the significance of understanding digital objects from this perspective?

Hume’s Philosophical Relations

Hume mentioned association and relations frequently throughout A Trea-
tise of Human Nature and An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,59 
yet there is an evident lack of coherence across his discussion. This has 
given rise to much confusion. Hume addressed the question of relation 
in two different contexts. In the first part of A Treatise of Human Nature, 
he introduces the three key ideas of associationism, namely, resemblance, 
contiguity, and causality. These three relations naturally link ideas together 
and “upon our conception of any idea, the animal spirits run into all the 
contiguous traces and rouze up the other ideas, that are related to it.”60 
These three relations, known as associationism, are often misleadingly 
taken as constituting Hume’s entire theory of relations. I will investigate 
here a further understanding of Hume’s relations and their significance for 
computation. We will need to consider here how we can understand rela-
tions in a broader context: from Hume and beyond Hume. Later in the 
same section, Hume points out the inadequacy of these three relations, 
which he calls “natural relations,” and introduces a more comprehensive 
understanding that he calls “philosophical relations.” Distinguishing the 
two, he writes that relation can be used

either for that quality, by which two ideas are connected together 
in the imagination, and the one naturally introduces the other, after 
the manner above explained: or for that particular circumstance, in 
which, even upon the arbitrary union of two ideas in the fancy, we 
may think proper to compare them.61

So we have two kinds of relations here. The first relies on a direction point-
ing from one idea to another. The second, the philosophical relation, ex-
tends the sense of relation “to mean any particular subject of comparison, 



130 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

without a connecting principle.” So in this sense, distance can be consid-
ered to “be a true relation.”62 On the basis of this outlined redefinition of 
relation, Hume derived seven categories of relations: resemblance, identity, 
space and time, quantity, quality, contrariety, and causality:

Resemblance: without which no philosophical relation can exist, 
because no objects will admit of comparison, despite having some 
degree of resemblance

Identity: of all relations the most universal is that of identity, as being 
common to every being whose existence has duration

Space and time: the source of an infinite number of comparisons, such 
as distance, contiguity, above, below, before, after

Quantity/number: all of those objects that admit of quantity, or num-
ber, may be compared in that particular

Quality/degree of quality: when any two subjects possess the same 
quality in common, the degree in which they possess it forms a fifth 
species of relation

Contrariety: no two ideas are in themselves contrary, except those of 
existence and nonexistence, which are plainly resembling, as imply-
ing both of them an idea of the object

Causality: all other objects, such as fire and water, heat and cold, are 
only found to be contrary from experience, and from the contrari-
ety of their causes and effects

Hume additionally distinguished two kinds of relations among these 
seven categories: “ ‘such as may be chang’d without any change in the ideas’ 
(identity, temporal and spatial relations, causality), and those that ‘depend 
entirely on the ideas which we compare together’ (resemblance, contrari-
ety, degrees of quality, and propositions of quantity and number).”63 The 
former is known as the internal relation and the latter as the external rela-
tion. An internal relation is “one grounded in the entities it relates and in 
nothing else.” An external relation is “one grounded in some entity wholly 
outside the entities related.” An example of the internal relation could be 
that middle E is higher in pitch than middle C. An example of an external 
relation could be that the glass of water is above the table.64 The charm 
of Hume’s relation theory is that it reintroduces the idea of an external 
relation that cannot be absorbed into the substance– predicates paradigm. 
This external relation has to be reintegrated with Hume’s definition of the 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 131

idea of substance, as we discussed earlier in considering Husserl’s interpre-
tation. There are two different ideas about externals we should consider. 
First, by definition, the predicates are already externalized from the sub-
ject in the sense that they are dispersed throughout time and space, wait-
ing for a unification via the imagination. Second, our perception of the 
world is always the play of relations. This implies that the object does not 
exist on its own. So for Hume, there is actually no such thing as the inter-
nal relation, which still remains at the core of Aristotelian science. Deleuze 
thinks that this division of relation, according to internality and external-
ity, is exactly what Kant believed in, as he grounded his critique solely 
on Hume. Deleuze defends Hume, making explicit his understanding of 
relation— that all relations are external. He quotes from Hume’s Treatise in 
supporting his argument:

Let us consider, that since equality is a relation, it is not, strictly 
speaking, a property in the figures themselves, but arises merely from 
the comparison, which the mind makes betwixt them.65

If comparison were therefore the foundation, then every relation would 
be external. Following from Hume, we can actually develop an analysis 
of relations via his seven categories. One would be right to imagine that 
Heidegger may not have easily agreed with this, as he would naturally ob-
ject to its formalization. Yet for Hume, his understanding of relation had 
its radicality in rejecting the traditional dualism within metaphysics in 
terms of substance– accident and matter– form. We could even go a step 
further and say that a thing is not a product of an a priori concept but is 
based on the contingency of the association of ideas. Kant could not toler-
ate this, so he developed a transcendental critique to define the necessity. 
He commented, “David Hume recognized that in order for us to be able 
to do this, the origin of these concepts must be a priori. But he was quite 
unable to explain how it is possible that concepts not in themselves com-
bined in the understanding should nonetheless have to be thought by it as 
necessarily combined in the object. Nor did it occur to him that perhaps 
the understanding itself might, through these concepts, be the author of 
the experience wherein we encounter the understanding’s objects.”66 We 
may infer from this that Kant took two steps away from the Aristotelian 
approach to categories. In the twelve categories proposed by Kant, he gave 
a higher priority to relations. Relation together with quantity, and quality 



132 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

together with modality, comprise the four classes of categories. Within 
each class, we find three categories. I would say that the first advancement 
of Kant was his clear proposition that the substance– accident relation 
only constitutes one of the three types of relations instead of its totality. 
Kant was aware of the arbitrariness of the number of categories, hence he 
proposed to differentiate the root concepts from the derivative concepts. 
Kant uses the word prédicables in contrast to the predicaments used to de-
scribe these “pure but derivative concepts,” hoping in the end to be able 
to “depict completely the genealogical tree of pure understanding.”67 The 
predicables are something rendered possible by the progressive develop-
ment of derivative categories, which in this sense implies a richer experi-
ence of objects. But did Kant really move beyond Hume? This is perhaps 
the defining crux between philosophical thought and scientific thought, 
whereby the resolution and progress of philosophical thought are not nec-
essarily guaranteed by later discoveries. We could well argue here that in 
Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, there is a step backward regarding the over-
all philosophy of relations; only in the Critique of Judgment, Kant’s concept 
of the organic form developed in the exploration of the teleological judg-
ment cast new light on the concept of relations and hence went beyond 
the dominant mechanical view of his time to concepts such as community 
(Gemeinschaft) and reciprocity (Wechselwirkung).68 In section 64 of the Cri-
tique of Judgment, Kant defines the organic being as follows: “a thing exists 
as a natural end if it is (though in a double sense) both cause and effect 
of itself.”69 Kant follows by giving an example of the tree and points out 
three elements that define it as such a being. First, the tree reproduces it-
self according to its genus, meaning that it reproduce another tree; second, 
the tree produces itself as individual— it absorbs energy from the environ-
ment and turns it into nutrients that sustain its life; third, different parts of 
the tree establish reciprocal relations and thus constitute the whole— as 
Kant writes, the “preservation of one part is reciprocally dependent on the 
preservation of the other parts.”70 The concept of the organic being con-
sists in the reciprocal relations and the identity as a tree that defines its 
natural purpose. I will, however, reserve this discussion of Kant’s organic 
form for elsewhere and only pursue the mathematical interpretation of re-

mulate a brief summary in preparation for our following inquiry. To distance 
ourselves from the Aristotelian line of inquiry, I propose two new terms: 
discursive relations and existential relations. Within this schema, Hume’s rela-
tions are discursive relations, because the presupposition is that we can only 
sense phenomena, which can then be described and related to each other 
through relations. This discursive relation does not mean that a thing must 
be spoken of as relating to other things, but it can be regarded as relating to 
other things (we can also understand the word prédicables in this sense). 
This ability to express is the ultimate foundation of Hume’s understanding 
of relations: because we cannot tell what the substance is, we shall need to 
surrender the idea of substance. These discursive relations are fundamen-
tally technical. The networks they constitute are based on the supposition 
of description and associations, or, more precisely, on the analyticity of 
language, and the possibility of being materialized. Heidegger contrib-
uted to what we are now calling existential relations: the sedimentations 
of experience and nonexperience that constitute the “already- there” and 
the Umgang with the world. “Being in” is always within the various pasts 
of the world that can be discursively described, and yet this “being in” 
itself escapes description and quantification. By the same token, we will 
also come to recognize that language is not only a descriptive tool but is it-
self also a unity of temporal relations. The next stage of our analysis is 
to demonstrate how this understanding of mind and discursive relation is

concretized within mathematics and modern computing. Here we cannot 
present a long history, but we can point to two decisive moments. The first 
is the development of relational calculus in mathematics, and the second 
is the appropriation of relational calculus in the development of the rela-
tional database.

The Formalization of Relations in Leibniz and Russell

The turning away from analysis of classes toward relations in mathemat-
ics was a very significant move within the last century. These relations are 
carried in the logical propositions and thereby model the basic structure 
of the metadata we are dealing with. This turn is especially important in 
Bertrand Russell’s The Principles of Mathematics,71 in which he dedicated 
several chapters to relations. Russell’s logical atomism, as the convergence 
of rationalism and empiricism, had its full expression in Wittgenstein’s 
Tractatus.72 Russell’s theory of relation also directed a critique against treat-
ing relations as a specific class, as Aristotle did. It is known that Bertrand 
Russell, in his monograph A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz, 
criticized Leibniz as being a reductionist who proposed that “every propo-
sition has a subject and a predicate”73 and consequently ignored relations. 
The notion of relation in Leibniz’s thought is rather complicated; some 
readers may first raise the objection that, for Leibniz’s system, as found in 
his Monadology, there is no place for relations, because monads don’t have 
windows. Meanwhile, some other authors in analytic philosophy, such as 
Massimo Mugnai, have argued for a theory of relations in Leibniz’s logic, 
and in Continental philosophy, it has been argued, notably by Christiane 
Frémont, that Leibniz’s system is fundamentally a system of communica-
tion and hence relational.74 It is not the aim of this book to elaborate these 
arguments but rather to show that there is a notion of relation that has 
been fundamentally ignored in the works of Leibniz. It is true that Leibniz 
undermines relations. In a letter to Temmik, he wrote:

In addition to the substances, which are final objects, there are 
the modifications of the substances, which are subject to crea-
tion and destruction in their own right. And finally, there are the 
relations, which are not created in their own right but result from 
the creation of other things; their reality doesn’t depend on our 
intelligence— they inhere without anyone being required to think 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 135

them. Their reality comes from the divine intellect, without which 
nothing would be true. Thus there are two things which only the 
divine intellect can realise: all the eternal truths and, of the contin-
gent ones, those which are relational.75

Relations are not accidents (which are modifications of the substance) 
but rather accidental. Relations are not real but rather virtual, because 
they do not manifest themselves through the subject– predicate reality 
but in a second process formalized by the intellect. This notion of rela-
tion becomes very clear when we understand that Leibniz’s ars charac-
teristica is an attempt to construct a system of signs in which each sign 
expresses the true categories of thinking,76 for example, notio primitiva 
et distincta. This new system of signs distinguishes itself from alphabetic 
writing in two ways, as Rita Widmaier points out: (1) the Zeichensystem 
doesn’t correspond to acoustic analysis but semantic analysis (it is largely 
visual) and (2) it doesn’t follow an abstract convention but a projective 
convention (it is largely imaginary). In other words, he wants to create an 
iconic model (ikonisches Model) of thought instead of an analog model.77 
The coherence (relations) between signs and things follows a preestab-
lished harmony and integrates Leibniz’s theory of logic into his whole 
systematic thinking of theology and cosmology. But this preestablished 
harmony demands traces; as Leibniz wrote, “if the sensible traces were not 
required, the re- established harmony between the soul and the body .  .  . 
wouldn’t have place.”78 What are these traces if not the materialization of 
relations between basic thoughts? Leibniz’s project of the Characteristica 
Universalis is fundamentally a system of expression as well as communi-
cation. Conversely, Russell’s critique is sound, because Leibniz himself 
didn’t understand these traces in terms of relations, though it is clear that 
he wanted to construct such relations. This becomes even more evident if 
we consider Leibniz’s 1666 doctoral dissertation “De Arte Combinatoria” 
and his later interest in drawing inspiration from Chinese characters to 
develop his signs. This project was further taken up by Gottlob Frege in 
his Begriffsschrift system, and there is a history of modern logic leading 
from Frege to the invention of the Turing machine (see chapter 5).

Russell criticized the ignorance of relational calculus as an unconscious 
philosophical error in mathematics. In criticizing the symbolic logic de-
veloped by Peirce and Schröder, he pointed out that



136 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

their method suffers technically (whether philosophically or 
not I do not at present discuss) from the fact that they regard a 
relation essentially as a class of couples, thus requiring elaborate 
formulae of summation for dealing with single relations. This 
view is derived, I think, probably unconsciously, from a philo-
sophical error: it has always been customary to suppose relational 
propositions less ultimate than class- propositions (or subject- 
predicate propositions, with which class- propositions are habitu-
ally confounded), and this has led to a desire to treat relations as 
a kind of classes.”79

To provide an example, let us look at a subject– predicate class proposi-
tion such as “The apple is green,” where there is an undeniable relation 
between the subject (apple) and the predicate (green). Moreover, we can 
develop this into the phrase “the apple has a green color.” This “has” is still 
logically an “is,” because the two are the same in this case. If we say “the 
apple tree has a green apple,” we cannot turn this into “the apple tree is a 
green apple,” because “has” places the two elements in a part– whole rela-
tion. The is and has relations have already been well explored by Husserl,80 
so we will not go into too much detail here. The key point for us is that 
there are some relations that escape internalization. In our example “the 
tree has a green apple,” we can identify the whole– part relation, which is 
still nevertheless an internal relation. As we noted earlier in the introduc-
tion, if we consider another example, such as “Heidegger knows Bertrand 
Russell” or “I am taller than you,” it becomes impossible to think of these 
statements in terms of subject– predicate and class proposition (Heidegger 
and Russell cannot be reduced to a class proposition— besides, both of us 
belong to the same class, “human being”); however, there still needs to 
be an independent mathematical treatment of this. Russell suggests that it 
could be expressed as xRy, in which x is understood as referent, y denotes 
relatum, and R denotes relata.81 It is also relevant here to think of the rela-
tive product, which, according to Russell, is of great importance— “since it 
doesn’t obey the law of tautology, it leads to powers of relations: the square 
of the relation of parent and child is the relation of grandparent and grand-
child, and so on.”82 The relational turning point in mathematics prompted 
Russell to declare that “we can now develop the whole of mathematics 
without further assumptions or indefinables.”83

Relational Calculus and the Relational Database

Relational calculus has been further developed in modern mathematics 
and computer science into the two following branches: (1) tuple relational 
calculus and (2) domain relational calculus. We have mentioned in the 
introduction that the mathematician and information scientist Edgar F. 
Codd has used the tuple relational calculus as the base of the relational 
database. Today we are aware that most information retrieval technologies 
(both online and offline) are more or less built on relational databases. 
The relational database did not become popular until the 1980s. The years 
1968– 80 can be characterized as the era of the nonrelational database, 
which was dominated by two other models, namely, the hierarchical data 
model and the network data model (developed by Charles Bachman). The 
problem with these earlier models is that they were difficult to maintain 
and lacked structural independence. The idea of the relational database is 
based on the introduction of two main qualities: “(1) data independence 
from hardware and storage implementation and (2) automatic navigation, 
or a high- level, non- procedural language for accessing data. Instead of 
processing one record at a time, a programmer could use the language to 
specify single operations that would be performed across the entire data 
set.”84 The attributes of a table specify the properties and relations of the 
data stored in it, but they are not the totality of relations, for they also pro-
duce relations through comparison, for example, difference or sameness. 
These relations, in comparison with the relation Heidegger talked about 
in Being and Time, are not merely symbolic but also numerical and calcu-
lable. Through the query languages, Amazon is able to find information 
regarding the “who, when, where” of buying Heidegger’s Being and Time. 
It can also find relations between people who bought Being and Time, for 
example, in terms of age group or whether they are classmates.

The key element of relational databases is their use of relations that are 
created by the comparison of names, as names are primarily identified to 
denote certain relations. Machines situate themselves in between these 
two layers, becoming the interpreters of relations. For machines are able 
to generate and process a large amount of data and relations, where the 
capacity of the human mind to do so is limited. This simple fact regarding 
the limitations of human memory and capacity for calculation has been 
known for a long time. We will see clearly later that data are themselves re-
lations and also sources of relations. The current technological condition 



138 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

is characterized by the question of “big data.” It appears that the produc-
tion of data through online activities is set to increase, making any indica-
tors obsolete within a relatively short period of time. To nominate these 
data as “useful” is to turn them into structured data. With XML, most 
data produced by mobile phone applications (e.g., web browser add- ons) 
follow a certain data scheme. As for the unstructured data, it is also pos-
sible to construct algorithms that can “normalize” them with an assigned 
structured meaning, for example, by identifying keywords. Let us now 
revisit the term ontologies. If we understand ontologies in an Aristotelian 
sense, we then already presuppose an internal relation intrinsic to the ob-
ject. But if we see it as the possibility of producing external relations and 
the production of digital objects, an ontology suddenly reveals a new way 
of thinking. In a manner similar to Kant’s categories, ontologies are also 
productive.

Relations, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), 
and Information Retrieval

The semantic web is different from a relational database; however, they 
work as a pair and share the common principle of knowledge representa-
tion.85 Illustrating this with a concrete case study will highlight the differ-
ences produced as a result of relational calculus. Without the ontologically 
driven information retrieval process— as on my personal web page— the 
ways of determining a relation between me and another person (e.g., 
Bertrand Russell) or an object are quite limited. For example, they can be 
determined through the recognizing of a link to the website of Bertrand 
Russell (URI) or by the recurrence of the name “Bertrand Russell” (e.g., if 
the name Bertrand Russell appears on my web page three times). Alterna-
tively, the relation could be determined by extracting these data and com-
puting with a certain coefficient, allowing a more refined relation between 
people– people or people– things to be established. The process turns out 
to be very complicated when more than two people have the same name.86

The second method of data extraction is via metadata, which is espe-
cially effective in the case of the semantic web. All metadata are well struc-
tured and prepared for machine compliance. Because of the employment 
of an ontology based on first- order logic, the computer is able to extract in-
formation through virtually infinitive linkages. Now let us consider a digi-
tal object and its metadata. These metadata operate exactly on the basis of 
the idea of relations— although following a recommendation of W3C, the 
resource definition framework (RDF) that specifies the core concepts of 
the semantic web. RDF is mainly based on the subject– predicate– object 
structure. Despite this making RDF sound like a conceptualization inher-
ited from the Aristotelian tradition, it is actually based on the operation 
of relations. To give an example, finding the relation between, say, Martin 
Heidegger and Bertrand Russell is much easier in this framework because 
the ontology Friend of a Friend (FOAF) already indicates that I am as-
sociated with Bertrand Russell. In addition, the use of SPARQLE, a query 
language, makes information extraction easy (Figure 18).87

It is worth mentioning the recent discussion on NoSQL, which is a newly 
conceived data management technique that came out in 2009. NoSQL was 
named by the computer scientist Johan Oskarsson, who described it as 
“nonrelational.”88 This is rather misleading, because in fact NoSQL is not 
only not nonrelational but it has a more radical understanding of relation 



140 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

than a relational database does. The major difference between NoSQL 
and the relational database is that NoSQL doesn’t define schemes in the 
same way. The relational database follows the ACID principles, namely, 
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, to make sure that trans-
actions are reliable. For some of the NoSQL data stores, the ACID prin-
ciples are not important, especially when dealing with big data. NoSQL 
allows a dynamic scheme, and hence it can handle data that cannot be im-
mediately categorized. For example, when the record is loosely organized 
in key- value form, one can easily add a new attribute without changing the 
whole scheme of the database.89 To speak in terms of digital objects, this 
means that digital objects can be defined much more quickly and easily 
without having a Platonic idea of their type in advance. Hence one can say 
that the digital objects are not managed according to a predefined archi-
tecture, and indeed, any relevant information can be integrated as part of 
the digital object whose objectivity becomes less formal, but it would be 
wrong to claim that it has nothing to do with relations.

To some extent, it would be valid to say that content is not a key issue 
for a digital object; what really matter are relations. Throughout the web 
of digital objects, it is simultaneously a web of relations. In the context of 
social networking, these relations determine almost everything: friends, 
the space and time of an object, and so on. When Facebook suggests a re-

mote friend to you, it does this precisely by accessing and operating upon 
relations. In the early period of the World Wide Web, a relation was only 
imaginable in terms of the hyperlink and reoccurrence; now relations are 
realized through data and dominate production on the Web. The era of 
the slogan “Content Is King” is over: relations have taken over. This does 
not mean that we do not need content but rather that content is rendered 
by forms into different relations. Thereby the primary function of content 
is to form resources for generating relations.90 As we discussed in the first 
chapter on the individuation of digital objects from the perspective of 
metadata, this process of taking over is no accident but a historical con-
sequence resulting from developments in computation.91 In the preced-
ing example of FOAF (Figure 18), the object consists of different relations 
that are unified by a “proper” name (not a general name) and identified 
with a unique URI. It is also worth mentioning in this context that Hume 
left a note at the end of his discussion of the seven relations:

It might naturally be expected, that I should join DIFFERENCE 
to the other relations. But that I consider rather as a negation of 
relation, than as anything real or positive. Difference is of two kinds 
as opposed either to identity or resemblance. The first is called a 
difference of number; the other of KIND.92

Hume’s apparent reservation in this short statement is actually unnec-
essary. In the OWL documentary of W3C, there is already a relation called 
“different from,” which concerns the negation of identities.93 This is not a 
coincidence but rather confirms that all logical propositions that construct 
the digital object already presuppose relations as the foundation of their 
existence. The association does not necessarily arise from psychology but 
rather from cognition, as we can identify in machines. In relational cal-
culus, we are immediately confronted with endless connections, such as 
the emergence of networks, digitalized and materialized logical relations. 
Because a data network does not manifest from the interiority of a specific 
domain, representation itself already presupposes relations ontologically; 
a network can only be formed from a comparison of relations— it is the 
inference of relations that establishes a network for reference. For the Web 
and for linked data, there is not just one network but many networks that 
can be constructed by specifying different relations. From the preceding 
analysis, we can identify two fundamental understandings of relations. 



142 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

First, there is Heidegger’s understanding of signs as relations and the pri-
macy of technical objects or equipmentality. Second, Hume’s theory of re-
lations was undermined, if not ignored, by Husserl’s and Heidegger’s phe-
nomenology. Through their appropriation by web technology, Humean 
relations are becoming less noetic and more materialized. Our remaining 
task is to identify how these two kinds of relations can be unified to de-
velop a better understanding of digital objects and the digital milieu.

Milieu and World: On Jakob von Uexküll and Heidegger

So far, we have seen two approaches to understanding objects in terms 
of appearance (Erscheinung) and composition, which simultaneously cor-
respond to two different orders of magnitude. The phenomenal world 
takes “founding steps,” to be “given” as the “already- there” of culture and 
memory without further inspection. The atomic world, however, seeks 
logical coherence without acknowledging what is outside its principles. 
These two approaches also provide us with two kinds of relations, one ex-
istential and one discursive. But these two types of relations cannot be to-
tally separated, as an apple can exist neither solely as a collection of atoms 
nor solely as its appearance. At this point, it is probably fair to argue that 
digital objects dissolve in relations. It is technologies that, based on the 
principle of hylomorphism, shatter the concept of substance and hylo-
morphism itself and begin a new epoch of metaphysics. The concretiza-
tion and materialization of relations give us a new mode of being- in- the- 
world. We may want to ask, to what extent can we value this philosophical 
trajectory of relations as we have outlined it? To address this, we shall go 
back to Heidegger’s ready- to- hand.

It is important to note here that Heidegger actually considered relations 
to be the foundation of the understanding of “ready- to- hand,” though he did 
not want to develop a concrete theory of relations as such. We have learned 
that for Heidegger, the “founding steps” can be put aside in our experi-
ence of the equipmental environment. For us, this means that the discur-
sive relation and its temporal structure are already presupposed and have 
been embedded as something similar to habits or voluntary mechanisms. 
Ready- to- hand, as Heidegger says, belongs to the signification of an in-
strumental totality. This “belonging to” is not to be understood in terms of 
property or ownership but rather in terms of the “as- structure,” the “some-
thing in order to” (etwas um zu) of the instrument.94 As in Heidegger’s ex-



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 143

ample, when we use a hammer, we use it as if there were time in the hammer 
itself; there is something in the hammer we are familiar with. We simply 
grasp the hammer and hit the nail without scrutinizing the hammer itself. 
The ontological understanding of this temporality is care (Sorge), which 
is made manifest from within the concern (Besorgen) of tools. Spatiality, 
according to Heidegger, is only existentially possible through temporal-
ity.95 When Heidegger says “the animal is poor in the world” and “stone 
is worldless,” he refers specifically to relations— a stone is worldless be-
cause its relations are only discursive relations, determining it as on the 
road, next to the tree, above the sand, and so on; animals are poor in the 
world but still nonetheless have a world. Giving the example of a lizard 
lying on a stone in the sunshine, Heidegger makes this explicit, stating that 
“the lizard has its own relation (eigene Beziehung) to the rock, to the sun, 
and to a host of other things.”96 The stones and the sunshine, for the liz-
ard, are not present- at- hand but rather ready- to- hand. The ready- to- hand 
exhibits the two types of relations that we mentioned, while many read-
ings of Heidegger easily favor the latter type (existential) under the title 
of “embodiment.”97 This understanding of the existential relation as em-
bodiment is a simplification, if not a distortion, of Heidegger’s ambition to 
tackle the meaning of “Being” in Being and Time. After all, Heidegger is not 
a scientist— even if he tended to analyze his subjects in a very technical 
and logical manner. As a consequence, his disciples were often too easily 
excited by the fact that Heidegger was scientific. Paul Bains, in his book 
The Primacy of Semiosis, identified the work of Jakob von Uexküll against 
Heidegger’s ready- to- hand through the idea of Umwelt.

The Umwelt is what lies in between environment and context, in which 
the living animal subjectively interprets the significance of the Umgebung 
(the objective space) to produce its world.98 For Uexküll, each animal has 
a different Umwelt, and each Umwelt subsequently has a different set of 
temporal and spatial frameworks.99 As a zoologist, Uexküll gives us a de-
tailed account of how an animal couples with the environment to produce 
an Umwelt, serving to aid in its means of survival. Uexküll’s famous ex-
ample is the tick and its interpretation of the environment. We shall first 
revisit the story of the tick:

The blind and deaf tick needs to eat, so it climbs to the end of 
some twig or branch, where it may fall or be brushed off onto a 
passing mammal. The tick climbs towards light because its skin 



144 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

is photo- sensitive. It can detect an approaching mammal with 
its sense of smell (i.e., the mammal has a specific odour caused 
by its sweat glands). When the tick senses the odour (or sign) of 
the passing mammal, it drops (with luck) onto it and latches on. 
The tick is sensitive to temperature and seeks out a warm, hairless 
spot (e.g., an armpit), where it will pump itself full of blood, and 
become the size of a garden pea.100

Bains, through his study of the semiologist John Deely, compares the 
tick’s biological adaptation to its environment with Heidegger’s ready- 
to- hand in terms of embodiment. The tick does not live in the world of 
plant, wind, mammal, and so on; rather, it lives in the world as world. This 
world as world is an unthematized environment, which is to say, there is 
no representation of things but the things themselves. This at first glance 
coincides with our analysis of Heidegger’s critique of the Geganstand as 
the problem posed by modern science and technology. Bains further 
quotes Heidegger’s statement in Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics 
(where Heidegger discussed and referred to von Uexküll’s book Umwelt 
und Innenwelt der Tiere) that the animal’s poverty in the world is “nonethe-
less a kind of wealth.”101 Bains tends to equate Heidegger’s ready- to- hand 
with what he considers Heidegger’s “prelogical apprehension of beings as 
a whole— [which] provides for the intelligibility of the objective world 
(Unwelt) presented in perception, apprehended in relation to itself.”102

To identify this way of responding to the environment in terms of what 
Heidegger called “ready- to- hand” is problematic, and I believe that we 
must distinguish between the world that signals and the animal that selects 
the signals. They are different, to be sure, though they are not separable— 
because if the world does not give any signal, then the animal will not re-
ceive it. The question has primacy over the issue of addressing the intensity 
of the signals being given and being received. To understand this nu-
ance, we should first briefly address the history of the word milieu, which 
George Canguilhem wonderfully outlined in The Living and Its Milieu.103 
In the course of the nineteenth century, there arose many debates and 
theories around the question of the milieu, for example, among think-
ers like Auguste Comte, Jean- Baptiste de Lamarck, Charles Darwin, and 
Alexander von Humboldt. Within these debates, we may observe that the 
relation between the living and its milieu often became progressively more 
intimate, while at the same time the use of the explanatory term milieu be-



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 145

came a scientific tool. This subsequently combined anthropology, biol-
ogy, statistics, laboratory experiments, and philosophy to develop a way 
to understand evolution and human behavior. We can probably say that 
the very first understanding of milieu was as the atmosphere and circum-
stances that englobe the living being. For Lamarck, milieu specifically re-
fers to fluid forms, such as light, water, and air. At the center of Lamarck’s 
theory of the milieu is adaptation: when the milieu changes, we naturally 
adapt ourselves to hold on to it, not letting it go, as if it hadn’t changed at 
all. It was Darwin who criticized these naturalists in his introduction to 
The Origin of Species, where he stated that “naturalists are always referring 
to external conditions like climate and food as the only possible cause of 
variations; they are only right in a very narrow sense.”104 Darwin offered 
two alternative understandings of milieu: (1) a social milieu of competi-
tion or struggle toward survival and (2) the geographical milieu of natural 
selection. Darwin extended the relation of the living and its milieu from 
an external environment toward social aspects, that is to say, toward a con-
sideration of the relations between organisms themselves.

For Canguilhem, the word milieu can be also applied in understanding 
the theory of Uexküll— only we must pay careful attention to what is in-
volved in the translation of the German Umwelt into the French word mi-
lieu. Canguilhem wrote, “Uexküll distinguishes between them with great 
care. Umwelt designates the behavioral milieu that is proper to a given or-
ganism; Umgebung is the simple geographical environment; and Welt is the 
scientific universe. For the living, the specific behavioral milieu (Umwelt) 
is a set of stimuli that have the value and significance of signals.”105 We can 
see here that the Umwelt is in fact no longer a milieu of the kind that we 
have seen before. It was under Canguilhem’s own initiative that he decided 
to reevaluate his own theory of the milieu; however, Uexküll’s notion of 
the Umwelt is something more along the lines of context. A context is a 
selection of significations of the subject. Context gives us another order of 
granularity within the analysis of the milieu. So if we identify Heidegger’s 
Besorgen with the Umwelt, then we may easily fall into the trap of thinking 
that the milieu/Umwelt is the subjective selection of significations. What 
is a selection? And what is the space in between where one can select and 
alternatively be selected? We may perhaps say instead that the world be-
comes the center, and what is considered to be its selection is only one of 
the “functions” of the world.

Technical objects (the hammer, the nail, the table, etc.) all constitute equip-
mental significances of the world. But what exactly is the world? It is by no 
means nature. Heidegger added a technical dimension on top of Uexküll’s 
Umwelt, such that we can go so far as to say that Heidegger was indeed 
addressing the question of the technical milieu. The problem of modern 
technology is a result of the failure to construct the technical milieu, in 
which the moderns appropriate all things as calculative entities that can 
be ordered by “will” (because humans tend to take phenomena to be the 
totality of things). This is the danger Heidegger calls the Gestell, or enfram-
ing, as the essence of technology. Heidegger’s idea of Gelassenheit, or medi-
tative thinking , as the antithesis of calculative thinking is an urge toward 
an alternative experience of things. It does not by any means refer to an 
animal form of life as being authentic. We can make a brief comparison be-
tween Heidegger and André Leroi- Gourhan on the question of technical 
milieu here. Leroi- Gourhan attempted to develop the concept of the tech-
nical milieu into a membrane between the interior milieu and the exterior 
milieu.106 The interior milieu is the part that is always alive and unstable; 
it is composed of an infinitude of elements, including used and stored 
products, internal secretions, hormones, vitamins, and so on. In contrast, 
one can perceive the exterior milieu as designating the part that is natural, 
inert, like wind, stones, and so on.107 Technics is situated in between the 
interior and exterior milieux, instead constituting a technical milieu. The 
technical milieu is not something that we can isolate from the totality of 
our society for the purpose of analysis, and it cannot be separated from the 
interior and exterior milieux. Leroi- Gourhan wrote,

The human group behaves in nature like a living organism, 
such as animals and plants, for whom the natural products are 
not immediately assimilable, but need the play of organs (le jeu 
d’organes) which prepares the elements; the human group assimi-
lates its milieu through a set of objects (un rideau d’objets (tools or 
instruments)). . . . The study of this artificial casing (enveloppe) is 
technology.108

Understood in this way, the technical milieu is thus fundamental to Hei-
degger’s understanding of the world. This would insinuate that a purely 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 147

biological and physiological understanding of it is insufficient, as such a 
view would not be able to integrate technics into the Umwelt. This would 
mean that instruments and tools should also correspond to temporal 
relations. Bernard Stiegler, in his book Technics and Time 1: The Fault of 
Epimetheus, introduces a totally new approach and direction of thinking 
based on his interpretation of Heidegger. He proposes that it is this “an-
amnesis nature” of technē that constitutes the “already- there,” as a history 
that belongs and is given to me, even though I have never experienced 
its establishment. The term “already there” (schon da) is borrowed from 
Heidegger, who uses it to indicate that at the time of Dasein’s thrownness, 
we immediately encounter the “already- there,” or the world. The world is 
not nature but is necessarily historical. History is time, and its sedimenta-
tion in the form of technical objects gives us the world. This consideration 
leads to another interpretation of technics. Stiegler approached this from 
the myths of Prometheus. The fault of the titan Epimetheus originated 
from his forgetting to distribute skills to human beings, thus he only real-
ized this problem after he had already gifted all the skills to other animals. 
So Epimetheus’s brother Prometheus had to steal fire from the Olympic 
gods to give it to humans in compensation for their lack of intrinsic special 
skills. This would subsequently constitute the very beginning of technē in 
human life. The fault of Epimetheus was forgetting, which resulted in the 
committing of the second fault of his brother— stealing fire. This double 
fault is simultaneously the default of origin (technē as a counterforce), as 
remedy and hindsight of forgetting; it is the prosthesis of human history 
and also a condition of existence.109 Dasein’s retrieval of truth is condi-
tioned by this default. Dasein’s being is characterized by finitude or being- 
toward- death, which in turn conditions Dasein’s understanding of exis-
tence. While animals may also have this temporal finitude, the difference 
is that for Dasein, it is not only a natural death but a death belonging to 
my own, which is an anticipation as well as a being- alone- with. In seeing 
death ahead, the world reveals itself as resoluteness, a temporal ecstasy of 
Dasein’s existence. This temporal ecstasy is at the same time historical— 
because the “now” for me is always singular, and this singular is always 
historically singular. This historical singularity of Dasein is no less than the 
adding up of the “historical singular” of technical objects.

Human beings, as being under the condition of the anticipation of death, 
must subsequently externalize their memory in technics, that is, through 
language, writing, tools, and gestures. Technics then embed the human 



148 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS

past as the already- there. This already- there is cultural memory, something 
we inherit but never experienced, which nonetheless constitutes the de-
fault of my knowledge and experience. The second expression of tertiary 
retention is technical objects— and in our case, digital objects. We write, 
we take photos, we make audio recordings and videos, we build social re-
lations that can be materialized as links on Facebook. These tertiary re-
tentions also constitute my primary and secondary retentions, just as the 
gramophone allows for the live performance to be played for a second 
(or nth) time. As part of our discussion of digital objects, we can locate 
another dimension of the “past,” besides that of habitual time, as being 
constituent of cultural memory. This is, however, also itself a program-
mable memory that largely distinguishes between the technical objects of 
Simondon and Heidegger and digital objects as the technical milieu and 
programmable context. This gives us the second “given” of the word datum 
(the first referring to sense data). We finish this chapter with an example 
of our experience on YouTube to illustrate how the milieu has taken on a 
different role, and to prepare us for the next chapter.

I move the mouse and click on a link— a link suggested to me as a de-
fault link on the index page of YouTube. My clicking action then leads me 
to a page where the video subsequently plays, and the pictures and images 
also appear. I then notice that there are several other suggested links to 
other videos that have been posted by other authors— several links telling 
me about related videos, including some data relating to statistics such as 
ratings and comments. While I am viewing all this, my attention is split 
between the video and all the peripheral displays, with the consequence 
that I go back and forth between them all the time. I then notice a related 
video that has an interesting title, and my attention totally shifts to the de-
tails of this video— its title, its small thumbnail screenshot, the number 
of times it has been viewed. Then I withdraw my attention from anything 
else I was previously engaging with as I try to discover what the relation 
is between this video and the one I was previously watching. I then click 
on this link that has grabbed my attention to watch this new video. My 
actions on YouTube can be clearly analyzed in terms of the movement 
from a pre- predicative experience, to thematization, and then to horizons. 
But the question we have not considered here is the givenness of the ob-
jects. We can consider another example that helps to clarify this point. 
Let’s imagine that a man, seeing a piled- up rope in the corner of a dark 



 THE SPACE OF NETWORKS 149

room upon entering, suspects it of being a snake. The situation is simply a 
given that cannot be elucidated through reflection. The subject is the core 
player who doubts, fears, and interprets. Finally, the man may not be able 
to judge definitively, and he will need (as a result) to use a stick to touch 
the rope to see if it is a snake. However, in our case, the givenness is actu-
ally a “passive” synthesis of the system or an intelligent agent according 
to the input I assigned to it. Naturally we must consider here whether it 
should really be called “passive”— as Cantwell Smith would possibly call it 
“active.” Where do these situations come from? And why is it this and not 
that? To explain this type of interaction, we need to move from objects as 
relations to systems of relations.

· CHAPTER 4 ·

The Time of Technical Systems

By the end of the previous chapter , we wanted to reunite the difference between two orders of magnitude through consider-
ing them in a state of constant materialization— passing from relations to 
milieux and thence to systems. We now want to seek how the gap between 
atomic composition and phenomenal appearance can be further bridged, 
as opposed to their continuing to be understood as two separable realities. 
This also gives us the opportunity to develop the concept of relations fur-
ther. By formulating both discursive and existential relations, we want to 
understand the dynamic within technological developments. I must make 
it clear that I am not criticizing a parallel reading of Heidegger and Uexküll 
in terms of embodiment as wrong; rather, I want to point to another direc-
tion of inquiry, which is more concerned with technological progress than 
the experience of embodiment or embodied reason. The development of 
the theory of embodiment disturbed the dominant research paradigms 
in AI in the 1970s. At that time, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, in his 
book What Computers Can’t Do (1972), launched a fierce attack on the ne-
glect of embodiment in AI research, which he later renewed in a modified 
version in What Computers Still Can’t Do (1992). At the heart of his cri-
tique was that such research took a Cartesian approach toward perception 
and action; in contrast, Dreyfus proposed what is now widely known as 
Heideggerian AI, which takes embodiment as the foundation of action. 
Dreyfus’s critique has influenced a generation of AI researchers, including 
Terry Winograd, Phil Agre, and others.

To understand Dreyfus’s critique and its relevance to our investiga-
tion, I briefly introduce the frame problem. In the early days of AI, Marvin 
Minsky, along with others, such as Herbert Simon and John McCarthy, 
envisaged that if we can represent the world in logical statements, all of 
these statements should be inferable, and the computer should be able to 
attain the level of human intelligence, at least in terms of common sense 
if not higher- level thought.1 But Dreyfus pointed out that even having 



152 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

millions of representations of objects and things in the world would not 
be enough to solve a commonsense knowledge problem. There are two 
reasons for this. First, it is difficult to imagine that we can include every 
possible context, and second, the computer is not able to construct con-
texts from millions of representations.2 The second reason is more impor-
tant, because Minsky proposed a microworld view in which it would be 
possible to attain intelligence by limiting the domain to a set of questions. 
This assumption is problematic, because it misses what Heidegger calls 
the Vorstruktur, or hermeneutics of understanding: the microworld pre-
supposes the being- in- the- world as a whole. The knowledge base will keep 
on increasing without fulfilling the essence of intelligence. Dreyfus thus 
claimed that the context problem would regress endlessly, which means 
that this Cartesian approach to AI is totally wrong:

To pick out two dots in a picture as eyes one must have already 
recognized the context as a face. To recognize this context as a face 
one must have distinguished its relevant features such as shape and 
hair from the shadows and highlights, and these, in turn, can be 
picked out as relevant only in a broader context, for example, a do-
mestic situation in which the program can expect to find faces. This 
context too will have to be recognized by its relevant features, as 
social rather than, say, meteorological, so that the program selects 
as significant the people rather than the clouds. But if each context 
can be recognized only in terms of features selected as relevant and 
interpreted in terms of a broader context, the AI worker is faced 
with a regress of context.3

Dreyfus’s critique of the philosophical foundation of AI is very clear and 
convincing. Conversely, we also have reason to see the semantic web or 
ontologies- driven approach as being quite similar to the good old- fashioned 
AI (GOFAI) dating back to the 1950s. As the computer scientist Yorick 
Wilks pointed out,

some have taken the initial presentation (2001) of the SW by 
Berners- Lee, Hendler and Lassila to be a restatement of the GOFAI 
agenda in new and fashionable WWW terms. . . . This kind of plan-
ning behaviour was at the heart of GOFAI, and there has been a 
direct transition (quite outside the discussion of the SW) from 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 153

decades of work on formal knowledge representation in AI to the 
modern discussion of ontologies.4

This would basically allow us to repeat Dreyfus’s critique for our context, 
that is, to argue that the ontologies- driven approach is not going to cre-
ate any real equivalent of human intelligence. We should, though, make 
a distinction here: the agenda of the earlier AI was about simulating in-
telligence, whereas the current ontologies- driven Web is no longer about 
simulation, nor is it concerned with a specific tool or instrument, but with 
creating an environment in which humans and machines can interact 
through materialized relations. That is also why our previous discussions 
focused on spatiality instead of intelligence. This also marks a fundamen-
tal difference between our approach and Dreyfus’s. The great contribution 
of Dreyfus is that he showed clearly the problem of intelligence simula-
tion and proposed a possible solution— embodiment, which was later fol-
lowed up by the neurodynamics approach developed by Walter Freeman.5 
Neurodynamics deals less with representation in the mind and more with 
the plasticity of the mind. It is a theory based on the materiality of neu-
rons, muscles, hormones; but here I suggest to look at the materiality of 
technologies— chains, electric cables, flow of electrons, and so on, and 
especially URIs.

This chapter will continue the discussion of relations. Rather than simply 
saying that there are relations that escape materialization, such as Dasein’s 
Being, I am more interested in looking at how materialization constitutes 
a new structure of temporality. We have already seen that digital objects 
or objects in general have to be fundamentally understood in terms of dis-
cursive and existential relations. Discursiveness comes from the ability to 
talk. There are two types of materialization of languages: one is through 
writing or print, the other re- creating artificial language faculties through 
grammatization and simulation. Compared with the former, which needs 
writing tools and paper, the latter demands finer interobjective relations. 
The development from GML through HTML to web ontologies is such a 
process of grammatization and simulation of logical faculties, which pre-
supposes analyticity and connectivity. With digital objects, we can see that 
those relations we are accustomed to viewing as at work in the mind— as 
in the theories of Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Husserl— are now becoming 
material and can be manipulated according to certain algorithms. When 
we consider that technological progress follows a trajectory from objects 



154 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

to sub- ensembles, then to ensembles, then to subsystems, and then to 
systems, the internal dynamic of tertiary retention transforms itself con-
stantly according to the changes of relations between objects. If we look 
at the development from Charles Babbage’s difference engine and ana-
lytical engine to the 1946 Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer 
(ENIAC), we can easily observe that the relations between mechanical 
parts are replaced by electronic switches. Discursive relations become ma-
terialized and translated into contacts between objects. I would like to call 
this approach to understanding relations interobjectivity. Interobjectivity is 
shadowed by intersubjectivity in the philosophical tradition. In the first 
half of this chapter, I show how intersubjective analysis tends to reduce 
all motivations to the subjective understanding and ignores the techno-
logical dimensions, and I propose how to understand the technical sys-
tem instead through the concept of interobjectivity. The second half of the 
chapter tries to understand the materialization of time as interobjective 
relations in a technical system and to show that it is not only mechanical 
time or clock time but also topological.

Intersubjectivity and Context

Intersubjectivity often refers to a collective consciousness between human 
subjects. Intersubjectivity becomes the common ground of cognition (hence 
knowledge) and feelings (empathy, morality, religion). To reach this com-
mon ground, a method is required for understanding the relation between 
subjects and objects. The pragmatic reading of phenomenology usually 
places the focus on intersubjective understanding without acknowledg-
ing interobjectivity. The human subject becomes the source of relevance, 
because understanding is always related to the knowledge inside the mind 
of the subject. Rather than attempting to address all phenomenologists, 
I focus here on the Husserlian phenomenological school as discussed in 
chapter 2. The fundamental goal of phenomenological deduction is to find 
this ground: the slogan “back to things themselves” in fact signifies an in-
vestigation of subjectivity by going back to the pure ego. We don’t imme-
diately reject this approach here; in fact, we return to it in chapter 5. The 
philosopher and sociologist Alfred Schutz’s phenomenology of relevance 
has pushed Husserl’s phenomenological understanding of context into the 
spheres of social and economic analysis.6 Schutz’s theory is also frequently 
referenced in information science to understand the notion of relevance, 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 155

because the most important question for information retrieval is how to 
present the most relevant information from a large set of data. I would like 
to show how the ignorance of interobjectivity limits the adoption of his 
analysis for our current condition.

Schutz’s exploration of a multiplicity of relevances is an attempt to ana-
lyze the polythetic structure of a context in its monothetical grasp by human 
actors. These two terms, polythetic and monothetic, are from Husserl, and we 
can once again use Heidegger’s examples of the hammer to demonstrate 
them. When a person has never seen a hammer at all, in his first encounter, 
he will have to work out how to use it (if many of us today don’t as often 
encounter a simple tool like a hammer, one could substitute something 
else, such as a new piece of computer software); he may, for example, have 
to scrutinize the handle, relate it to something else in his past experience, 
and so on. This way of looking at a hammer is polythetic. But when he 
gets used to the hammer, he doesn’t have to go through this procedure; he 
just grasps it and hits the nail. Now his grasp of the hammer is something 
monothetic. In this sense, Schutz’s project has an affinity with Heidegger’s, 
and he actually refers in the text to Heidegger’s ready- to- hand:7

Even if I attempted to break down socially desired knowledge 
into polythetic steps, it may frequently turn out that these tradi-
tional, habitual items of knowledge are such only as regards the 
monothetic meaning pertaining to the things supposedly known, 
whereas the tradition which contains the polythetic steps leading 
to this sedimentation (i.e. to the monothetic meaning) has been 
lost. It may even be that polythetic steps of this kind were never 
performed, that the socially divided knowledge is based on the 
authority of a philosopher or hero or saint or the blind belief in-
corporated in the “idols of the tribe.”8

The monothetic equivalence of the polythetic steps always refers to what 
Schutz calls the knowledge in stock at hand. This knowledge at the same 
time refers to a chronicled construction (as well as reconstruction) of past 
experience (social) and cognitive maturity (autobiographical and biologi-
cal). Schutz actually quoted research by Jean Piaget to prove that “it would 
be impossible to teach a child, for instance, problems relating to causality 
before his general mental development has attained a level at which the 
underlying basic concept makes sense to him. Untimely knowledge, even 



156 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

of matters of fact, may lead to serious disturbances, as the case studies of 
psychoanalytic writers amply show.”9 Schutz classifies knowledge in stock 
at hand into four categories, which I summarize as follows:

1.  sedimentations of our previous mental activities, for example, 
scientific knowledge, interpretation of problems

2.  habitual possessions, including theoretical activities as well as 
practical thinking and acting (e.g., ways of solving problems, ways 
of using tools). The habitual possession is something human be-
ings tend to ignore and forget. This is akin to Heidegger’s critique 
of modern technology as taking for granted the “es gibt,” the given 
of its nature

3.  the temporal and meaning structure of the world, or what Schutz 
calls “the performativity of our actions within the ontological 
structure of the world.” The meaning structure refers to the indi-
visible temporal significance of human experience, for example, 
“phrasing” in music, when musicians have to divide the piece into 
different phrases to practice; other divisions, such as dividing into 
single notes or random phrasing, will lead to the destruction of 
meaning

4.  knowledge we have derived from the social world, from human 
communication, social and cultural experience, and intersubjec-
tive understandings of being- in- the- world10

The human subject can access this knowledge in stock at hand according 
to different levels of relevance. Schutz classifies three types of relevance, 
namely, topical, interpretational, and motivational. Topical relevance is 
when something “is constituted as problematic in the midst of the unstruc-
turalized field of unproblematic familiarity— and therewith the field into 
theme and horizon.”11 Schutz further classifies two types of topical rele-
vance, “imposed relevance” and “intrinsic relevance,” the former being the 
emergence of unfamiliarity within a familiarized environment (e.g., thun-
der on a sunny summer afternoon), whereas the latter is a natural change 
from one topic or theme to another (e.g., the user shifts her attention to 
an online advertisement next to her e- mail). Interpretational relevance re-
fers to the subject’s interpretation of the typicality of a certain phenome-
non appearing to her by being retrieved from her conceptual field. For 
example, when a man sees a coiled- up rope in a dark corner of the house, 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 157

he may suspect that it might be a snake and will therefore have to make an 
interpretation. This can be understood as what Husserl calls “explication,” 
which is the subject’s ability to direct his intention to a particular part of 
his pre- predicative experience. Motivational relevance is characterized in 
three ways, which Schutz condenses into three phrases: “because of,” “in-
terested,” and “in order to.” Schutz’s employment of Husserl’s life- world 
is useful to information science, but it does not go far enough to be em-
ployed in the understanding of a milieu that is highly technical.

Like Husserl, Schutz paid no attention to the problematic of the given-
ness associated with objects but relied on the sedimentation of knowledge 
of the subject, even though he had the opportunity to investigate the ob-
ject more thoroughly, for example, in terms of the phrasing in a piece of 
music. Schutz noted that the environment cannot be taken as given but 
should be seen as the result of selection. This may be true when a man 
is walking in the forest and every scene that comes to him is always al-
ready a selected one. But in the digital milieu, the givenness is not given 
by nature but results from a series of calculations and interactions (which 
also produce bugs). The user’s role in a preprogrammed context is always 
already anticipated, if not totally programmed. In another sense, we can 
still say that Schutz is right, because every ostensive communication also 
implies selection, but this selection doesn’t entirely depend on the sub-
ject; it is initiated by a programmed givenness. That is to say, we are never 
in an original time but always already in an adopted time. At the end of the 
book, Schutz did discuss this state of ignorance:

We live in our present culture surrounded by a world of machines 
and dominated by institutions, social and technical, of which we 
have sufficient knowledge to bring about desired effects, without, 
however, much understanding (if any) of how these effects have 
been brought about. We turn switches, press buttons, operate dials, 
and know as a matter of course that the bulb of the lamp over my 
desk will give some light, that the elevator will go up to the desired 
door, or that I have a good chance to hear over the telephone the 
voice of the party I want to talk to. . . . Yet I remain rather ignorant 
concerning how these effects are brought about. I just know that “some-
how” my turning the dial of the telephone sets in motion several mecha-
nisms of one kind or another . . . and that by all these unknown or only 
vaguely known events I will be able to talk to my distant friend.12



158 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

Yet this ignorance isn’t a problem for Schutz, as he indicates by citing the 
following examples: putting letters into the mailbox without needing to 
knowing how post offices work; receiving money from work and purchas-
ing merchandise and services without needing to become an economist; 
talking to a friend without knowledge of how the larynx works. This high-
lights the impossibility of making technical objects transparent, and one has 
to take these abstractions as natural; as we have seen already in chapter 3, it 
is for this reason that phenomenology focuses on the “phenomenon.”

Context and Milieu

If we can simplify the definition of intersubjectivity as that which consists 
of a subject– context correlation, then its other pole, interobjectivity, has 
the sense of an object– milieu correlation. A milieu is different from a con-
text: whereas a context is always a selection of significations of the subject, 
a milieu is more timely; it lasts, and for it to change requires a process of 
(re)structuralization. This structuralization moves from one material con-
dition to another. The materialization of relations makes explicit what has 
been implicit, that is also to say that it reduces the distances or shortens 
the detours one needed in the past to carry out the same action; the multi-
plied explicitnesses also creates a complicity that in turn reintroduces im-
plicitness. The reconfiguration of relations constitutes a new interface that 
allows human beings to access both the world and nature. This interface 
is at the same time divergent and convergent. It diverges because techno-
logical development has demanded an increasingly fine definition of ma-
terials and practices, which leads to constant bifurcations; it converges be-
cause human practices always override these distinctions and bring them 
together according to specific situations and needs. I wanted to show in 
the preceding passages that the traditional approach of intersubjectivity 
ignores the largely discursive relations materialized in objects or subordi-
nates them to the object of recognition of intersubjectivity. Conversely, in-
tersubjectivity is determined by a system of relevance, which is in turn the 
sedimentation of knowledge. This stock of knowledge at hand expressed 
between the interiority of individuals and ethnic groups is what Leroi- 
Gourhan would call the technical milieu.

In contrast to such approaches, I want to show how an analysis of inter-
objectivity of digital objects is possible and can supplement the analysis 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 159

of culture through intersubjectivity.13 Here I want to go back very quickly 
to Heidegger again on the question of intersubjectivity and interobjectiv-
ity, because I think a rereading of the concept of relation in Heidegger’s 
thought is important in relation to our previous discussion on spatiality. 
Other than Husserl’s approach, which focused on the subject’s capacity for 
reduction, Heidegger proposes to understand subjectivity through time, 
because time is historical and Dasein is always historical being. Time can 
be privated (i.e., subjected to privation), for example, when I am asked “do 
you want to go out tonight?” and respond with “I don’t have time.” I do 
have time, but I private my time, and I make it my own time. But by the 
end I am in time, in historical time, because Dasein is always historical. 
This hermeneutic view of time puts historical events in a much broader 
and more profound network of causalities compared with a chronicled 
record of history. Hence intersubjectivity is always historical and cul-
tural. Husserl and Heidegger provide two understandings of intersub-
jectivity. For Husserl, intersubjectivity finds its epodeitic ground in the 
substantive pure egos; for Heidegger, intersubjectivity finds its ground in 
the thrownness (Geworfenheit) of Dasein in history.

What is profoundly different between Husserl and Heidegger in my 
reading is not that Husserl’s phenomenology is categorial while Hei-
degger’s is temporal but, as I will suggest, one can find an ambivalent yet 
profound understanding of interobjectivity in the thought of Heidegger. 
Tout court: if intersubjectivity is expressed as the grammar of the monadic 
egos of Husserl or the grammar of Zeitlichkeit of Heidegger, then at the 
center of interobjectivity is the grammar of relations between objects, 
which gives us both Geschichte and Geschichtlichkeit. We have seen in chap-
ter 3 that Heidegger immediately rejected the possibility of a philosophy 
of relations: how, then, can we still regard him as a thinker of interobjec-
tivity? Moreover, we constantly have to confront an endless metaphysical 
question: what is a relation? Everything could be relational, even time and 
space. We have also proposed to approach discursive relations from the 
perspectives of Hume and Russell, who understand objects through rela-
tions instead of accidents and substances. Hence for Hume, as we have 
seen, relations are the foundation of objectivity and, consequently, of in-
terobjectivity. We have also exposed the insufficiency of Hume’s relations 
and arrived at a distinction between discursive relations and existential 
relations. Humean relations are noetic because he wants to use them to 



160 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

speculate on how the mind works. Through interobjectivity, we can ana-
lyze social relations, not through social interactions, but through material-
ized relations in the technical system.

My understanding of interobjectivity has two parts. First, it refers to 
the materialization of both internal and external relations of objects. A 
general tendency of technology consists in the materialization of all sorts 
of relations by rendering what are otherwise invisible elements or aspects 
in visible and measurable forms. This materialization also implies a schema-
tization that resolves certain problems or obstacles. For example, when we 
formulate a mathematical problem, we need to draft and draw on paper to 
materialize thoughts in traces, after which we can reorganize these traces 
to go further. Time can also become a temporal relation for machines: for 
example, the alarm clock set at 7:00 a.m. can wake you up, but this tem-
poral relation is composed neither of feelings nor of sensitivities but rather 
of material contacts; in earlier times, these contacts would have been be-
tween gears and wheels, and now they are between oscillations of quartz 
and signals. The history of interobjectivity unfolds itself in different stages 
of technological development; it is also the history of the development of 
its language proper, which shouldn’t be immediately analyzed in terms of 
syntax and semantics. Interobjectivity moves from immaterial to material, 
sacred to profaned, intangible to tangible. The second dimension is that 
materialized interobjectivities create their own milieux that connect both 
nature and artifacts. If Uexküll’s tick gives us the basic concept of milieu, it 
is nevertheless a primitive one (as Simondon terms the primary categories 
in contrast to those of mental images and symbols14) that is constituted by 
nature. Human beings construct and use tools that prolong their sensibili-
ties. At the same time, tools become systems and create their own milieux.

Interobjective Relations

Gilbert Simondon is probably the most systematic thinker of interobjec-
tivity. Let us revise two examples we discussed in chapter 1 to illustrate the 
preceding two points concerning interobjectivity. The first is the evolu-
tion from the diode to the Lee de Forest triode and then to the tetrode/
pentode. The diode is a device that controls the flow of current in a single 
direction. In its simplest form, within a vacuum tube, the cathode is heated 
and hence activated to release electrons. The anode is positively charged 
so that it attracts electrons from the cathode. When the voltage polarity 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 161

is reversed, the anode is not heated and thus cannot emit electrons; con-
sequently, there is no current. A triode places a control grid between the 
anode and the cathode. A DC current can give a bias to the grid: if it is 
negative, it will repel some of the electrons back to the cathode and hence 
serve as an amplifier. A tetrode puts a screen grid next to the control grid 
so as to control the rate of amplification. Interobjectivity is produced here 
by the contacts of electrons, and through a schematization, they can be 
effectively controlled.

In relation to the second point concerning the milieu, Simondon often 
spoke of the Guimbal turbine (named after the engineer who invented it), 
which, to solve the problem of loss of energy and overheating due to the 
Joule effect, uses oil to lubricate the engine and at the same time isolate 
it from water; it is then also possible to integrate a river as the drive and 
the cooling agent of the turbine. The river here is the external milieu for 
the engine, but it also establishes relations with it, for example, the con-
tact surfaces. This relation is materialized in the realization of the engine. 
In digital objects, we see another type of materialization, through virtual 
relations determined by representations and controlled by automation. 
We have looked at the first markup language, GML, which was invented 
to solve the problem of incompatibility between different software while 
they are computing the same object. GML resolved the compatibility issue 
by producing a common object for different software; the emergence of 
the relational database in the late 1970s and 1980s resulted from an effort 
to solve the same problem, but at that time the concept of a digital object 
was not yet concretized. The further development of metadata standards, 
such as HTML, XML, and web ontologies, since the 1990s has broadened 
the use of digital objects so that they can be used at whatever place and 
time and by any web- based tools.

Interobjectivity is a reality as well as a constantly motivated (improved) 
medium that can resolve the incompatibility between different systems 
(including human and technical systems). This is not immediately evident. 
I would like to unfold the basis for such an understanding through a re-
interpretation of Heidegger’s 1949/1950 article “Das Ding” and Simondon’s 
exposition of the emergence of technical objects in Du mode d’existence 
des objets techniques. In the early stage of interobjectivity, data are always 
given. The givenness of data is also the givenness of the world. Our ex-
perience of the world is always experience with something given, not 
only something physically standing there but also something given to 



162 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

our perception, which constitutes the primary source of our experience. 
Human beings and objects of experience should not be posed as oppo-
sitions, as Heidegger says of the Gegenstand. Instead, they should all be 
understood in terms of being- in- the- world, that is, with a sense of their 
togetherness. After describing actual technological developments—tele-
visions, radios, airplanes— Heidegger wrote that today the distances be-
tween places, people, time zones, are disappearing because of technological 
advancements. He then questioned, however, whether this disappearance 
of distance really means nearness, asking,

What is happening here when, as a result of the abolition of great 
distances, everything is equally far and equally near? What is this 
uniformity in which everything is neither far nor near— is, as it 
were, without distance? Everything gets lumped together into uni-
form distancelessness. How? Is not this merging of everything into 
the distanceless more unearthly than everything bursting apart?15

Heidegger proposed to go back to das Ding. The thing is not the object 
that we contemplate by using our everyday categories. Instead, Heidegger 
provokes a new set of categories to unfold the thingness of a thing. My 
interpretation is as follows: Heidegger shows that thingness can only be 
thought in terms of relations pertinent to its milieu; there is no longer ob-
jectivity as such but rather interobjectivity. This interobjectivity is char-
acterized by the fourfold (Geviert), which Heidegger illustrated through 
reference to the example of a jug, where he inquired into its essence: the 
jugness of the jug has to be understood in terms of the earth (Erde), heaven 
(Himmel), the divine (die Göttlichen), and mortals (die Sterblichen). The se-
cret of the thing (Ding) is that it cannot be posed as something standing 
against— Gegenstand— but should be understood rather as a gathering of 
beings in which Being reveals itself. The most important difference be-
tween an object and a thing for Heidegger is that a thing stands on its own, 
whereas an object stands against; a thing gathers, an object sets up dis-
tances. The word Ding comes from the old German word dinc, which also 
means gathering for certain purposes like celebrations and ceremonies:

Neither the general, long outworn meaning of the term “thing,” as 
used in philosophy, nor the Old High German meaning of the word 
thing, however, are of the least help to us in our pressing need to 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 163

discover and give adequate thought to the essential source of what 
we are now saying about the nature of the jug. However, one seman-
tic factor in the old usage of the word thing, namely “gathering,” 
does speak to the nature of the jug as we earlier had it in mind.16

Gathering characterizes interobjectivity according to the technicity of its 
epoch. The thing, here a jug, that is also a technical object brings other 
things together from a distance. In this setting of the fourfold, there is nei-
ther subject nor object; there is only Dasein, who exists among other be-
ings as part of the gathering. This being part- of- an- event (Ereignis) disrupts 
the Cartesian subject– object configuration. It could be the first theoretical 
exploration of interobjectivity as well as a philosophical effort to return to 
the magical moment of existence through artifacts. How could a digital 
object be understood as fourfold? It may be possible, but then what would 
this really mean? That is to say, the fourfold shouldn’t be considered a rule 
that we can apply to things; on the contrary, it should be posed as a way of 
thinking about interobjectivity. To make this clearer, we need to go back 
to a hypothesis about the history of technology put forward by Simondon. 
Simondon wanted to outline a history of technology departing from the 
primitive magical moment. In ancient times, magic was pretechnological 
and prereligious. There was no distinction between subjects and objects; 
as Simondon put it,

the magic mode of relation to the world isn’t at all lacking of orga-
nization: in the contrary, it is rich in implicit organisation, attached 
to the world and to the human; the mediation between human 
and the world at this point isn’t yet concretized and constituted of 
specialized objects or human beings, rather the meditation exists 
functionally in a first structuralization, the most elementary of all: 
that which gives rise to the distinction between figure and ground 
in the universe. The technicity appeared as structure resolving an 
incompatibility: it specializes figural functions, while the religions 
on the other hand specialize functions of the ground.17

Simondon takes the concept figure- ground from Gestalt psychology, 
which suggests that the perception of form arises from the competition 
between figure and ground.18 In this structuralization of the magic mode of 
existence, the distinction between figure and ground emerges while they 



164 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

also couple with each other. That is to say, the figure is the figure of the 
ground and the ground is the ground of the figure. In the primitive magi-
cal mode, there existed singular points, such as certain places and mo-
ments, that exhibited magical power, bringing human and world together. 
These places and moments became hubs or what Simondon called key 
points (points clefs) of reticulation. Interobjectivity— let alone the fact that 
the word object didn’t yet exist in that context— operated in an invisible 
and immaterial manner. As Simondon said, these key points operate at a 
distance, as through forces that can exert influence from afar. The rupture 
happened when the figure was detached from the ground, when objects 
were separated from subject. In this instant, we observe two divergences. 
First, there is the divergence between the subjectification of the ground 
in religion and the objectification of the figure in technology. Technical 
objects, detached from the ground, traversed geometrical spaces and func-
tions in whatever place and whatever time, before becoming obsolete 
in terms of technicity. The will to universalize technical objects requires 
new relations that bring objects or different parts of a technical ensemble 
back together— they no longer work from a distance as magical power but 
rather through contacts and steps:

At the same time, the key points lose their mutual reticulation and 
their power to exert influence at distance on the reality that encom-
passes them; they, like technical objects, only have action by contact, 
point by point, instant by instant. This rupture of the network of key 
points frees the characters of the ground, which in turn, detach 
from their own ground, narrowly qualitative and concrete, float 
over all the universe, in all space and all duration.19

Despite the difference between Simondon and Heidegger, I have char-
acterized Heidegger as a thinker of interobjectivity, because Heidegger at-
tempted to find in philosophy a force that reattaches Dasein, things, and 
the universe, that is, through a certain trajectory of philosophical think-
ing, to reattach the human to the world from which it has been alienated. 
Heidegger’s critique of the idealization of things from Plato to the techno-
science of his day, which considers things as standing reserve (Bestand), is 
in certain sense genealogical, in that it outlines a problematic path depart-
ing from a fundamental forgetfulness and the exigency of a fundamental 
Ontology. Heidegger wants to retake the technical object, for example, 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 165

the jug, as a site that allows the reattachment of the human being to the 
world to happen. There is a tendency to reverse materialized interobjec-
tive relations into invisible and magical relations, or as Simondon might 
put it, a tendency to return to the totality or unity of the ground and the 
figure. We may also be able to derive a similar reading from Sein und Zeit, 
when we consider that Heidegger’s hermeneutic approach to the use of 
tools (Besorgen) and the understanding of historicity (Geschichtlichkeit) 
always refers to a background that is present but not present- at- hand. For 
example, when explaining the ready- to- handness of using a hammer, the 
significations come from the background, which consists of both habitual 
and cultural knowledge that Dasein cannot thematically grasp.

Interobjectivity as Technical Progress

Our interpretation of Heidegger’s spatiality and temporality in chapter 3 
also showed the hermeneutic relationship between context and its milieu: 
time in context– context in time. When we use a hammer, we are in a con-
text of doing something, serving certain purposes; the way we use it, con-
versely, entails a large set of background information, such as our habits, 
the properties of that hammer that were made to fit certain purposes, and 
our relation to the hammer. Hence, for Heidegger, the temporal ecstasy of 
Dasein’s being is produced by the relations between the present, past, and 
future in the coupling between Dasein and its world. From Being and Time 
(1927) to “Das Ding” (1950), we can see that Heidegger also lingered in 
between context and milieu. In the preceding exploration of the concept 
of interobjectivity, we come to see that such a concept can constitute the 
philosophical task of understanding the world and its transformation. We 
should consider how the materiality of the digital further reconstitutes the 
concepts of time, context, and milieu within a technical system.

Simondon’s approach is quite different, but he and Heidegger share the 
same task— they both see philosophy as the mediation that can produce 
convergences in compensation for the divergence of technical thoughts 
and religious thoughts, practices and theories. Simondon doesn’t talk 
about ontology as a foundational ground of beings but instead proposes 
to think of the genesis of technical objects and the lineage of technicity 
and to find a way out in the process of invention. Genesis is similar to the 
process of individuation; it is generated from two types of incompatibili-
ties: first, incompatibility with itself, and second, incompatibility with its 



166 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

milieu. Genesis is an internal dynamics of objects— also its destiny, in a 
certain sense:

Figure and ground separate from each other in order to detach 
from the universe to which they adhered; the key points objec-
tify, only they conserve their functional characters of mediation, 
become instrumental, mobile, capable of being effective at what-
ever place and whatever moment: likewise with the figure, the 
key points detached from the ground of which they were the key, 
become technical objects, transportable and abstracted from the 
milieu.20

Technical mediation also has to take into consideration the orders of mag-
nitude of the objects that we are dealing with. For example, the jug acts as 
a mediation between the user and the liquid. The technical object that one 
chooses is not arbitrary, for example, it has to respect the order of mag-
nitude of liquid. We won’t be able to carry the liquid with a colander. As 
Simondon showed, these different technical objects— for example, a jug 
and a colander— contain certain technical mediations of interobjectiv-
ity. This interobjectivity is not a general term but has to be understood in 
terms of different orders of magnitude, for example, in terms of the differ-
ence between the order of liquid and powder and that of rocks and trees, 
while technics is the search for a solution that mediates the incompatibil-
ity caused by different orders of magnitude:

These different mediations have a common essence as system of 
adaptation; the molecules of liquid or the grains of powder are 
of an order of magnitude that don’t allow them to be effectively 
manipulable by the human body without an intermediate object 
which holds billions of them in unity.21

Heidegger also talked about the jug as the mediation that distributes 
and holds wine for humans: “how does the jug’s void hold? It holds by tak-
ing what is poured in. It holds by keeping and retaining what it took in. The 
void holds in a twofold manner: taking and keeping. . . . The two fold hold-
ing of the void rests on the outpouring . . . to pour from the jug is to give.”22 
The essence of the thing is its power of reunification across distance. This 
interobjectivity that could be united in das Ding from a distance is— as we 
have seen in the quotation from Simondon— slowly replaced by contact, 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 167

instants, and so on. Aristotle’s hylomorphism for Simondon has already 
moved far away from primitive magic thought and gives the “primary in-
tuition” of technical experience (expérience technique):

The way in which Aristotle describes the relation of form and 
matter, which supposes in particular the aspiration of the mat-
ter towards the form (matter aspires towards the form as female 
toward male), is already removed from primitive magic thought, 
because this aspiration can only exist if there has been a prelimi-
nary detachment, whereas it is a sole being that is at the same 
time matter and form.23

I would like to suggest that the genesis of technical objects can be seen as 
the invention of a new interobjectivity that tries to materialize relations 
between objects and resolve the incompatibilities of the interior and exte-
rior milieux. For Simondon, invention is not something that comes from 
a genius at a random historical moment but rather always corresponds to 
a problem, which is an interruption or discontinuity posed by a technical 
obstacle and acts like a barrier to progress.24 Simondon is certainly one of 
the pioneers who looked into the genesis of interobjectivity through the 
lens of compatibility by strolling through the phylum of technical objects, 
ranging from elements, objects, and ensembles to individuals, milieux, 
and systems. In the same passage, Simondon referred to Heidegger: “the 
thought that recognizes the nature of technical reality is what, going beyond 
the separated objects, the utensils, according to Heidegger’s expression, discov-
ers the essence and the impact of technical organization, beyond separated ob-
jects and specialized professions.”25 The development of data schemes, on-
tologies, and protocols brings objects and users closer to each other and 
shortens the temporal and geographical distance involved in information 
acquisition. It brings us a new convergence by which we can talk about 
the internet of things, social media, and so on. This totality we can call a 
technical system.

From Milieu to System

The ultimate expression of interobjectivity is the formation of technical 
systems that traverse all spatial and temporal obstacles. But this also poses 
a problem, because interobjectivity becomes a force that leads nowhere, 
just as Heidegger said at the very beginning of the 1950 article “Das Ding” 



168 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

that the elimination of distance doesn’t mean nearness— if we understand 
this nearness as a mode of convergence signified by the double sense of 
Ding/dinc. What then is a technical system, and how could we conceptual-
ize it regarding the digital milieu? Milieu and system are two different con-
cepts and have to be distinguished because the proliferation of the term 
technical system designates a significant moment in technical progress as 
well as the thought of technics. Mathieu Triclot, in “Technical Milieu— 
Genealogy of a Concept,” proposed that the term technical milieu has been 
slowly replaced by the term technical system.26 More precisely, according 
Triclot’s analysis with Google tools (though the accuracy of the findings 
of such a method may be doubtful), after the Second World War, the term 
technical system in the French- speaking world became increasingly popular 
only until 1968. After this, its usage dropped to a minimal level, and it only 
began to become popular again in the 1980s, since which time it has al-
most replaced the term technical milieu. We may speculate about quite a 
few factors that may have contributed to this phenomenon. One of these is 
the fact that the milieu resists analysis (with the exception of Simondon’s 
associated milieu, which we pick up again in chapter 6). Compared with 
the technical system, the milieu is an abstract concept, in which relations 
are referential, whereas in a technical system, relations and structures are 
much more concretized. But the question that is more pressing for us is, 
what is signified by the emergence of the concept of the technical system? 
My understanding of the technical system is inspired by two French think-
ers, the historian Bertrand Gille and the philosopher Jacques Ellul.

Ellul used the word le système technicien, which was translated as “tech-
nological system,” though it literally means “technician system.” Gille uses 
le système technique. Both these original terms are actually broader in scope 
than the common translation “technological system.” I think in fact that 
le système technicien may even be better for capturing our contemporary 
situation, because our culture is increasingly becoming one of technologi-
cal engineering. The choice of any of these terms may give rise to con-
fusion, especially because, for certain historians, the technical system has 
always existed. The reader should note that for our discussion here, the 
translation “technical system” is prioritized, because I want to contrast a 
technical system with a technical milieu. Ellul’s dynamic technological 
system was heavily influenced by Simondon as well as by other thinkers, 
such as Talcott Parsons and John von Neumann. From Simondon’s Du 
mode d’existence des objets techniques, Ellul took up the progress from ob-



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 169

jects to ensembles, thence to subsystems and then systems, as the base of 
his own theory:

The technological object, becoming detachable, can be grouped 
with other technological objects according to such and such an ar-
rangement: the technological world offers an indefinite availability 
of groupings and connections. . . . Constructing a technological 
object means preparing an availability: the industrial grouping is 
not the only one to be realized with technological objects— we can 
also realize nonproductive groupings, whose goal is to attach man 
to nature through a regulated concatenation of organized media-
tions, to create a coupling between human thought and nature. The 
technological world intervenes here as a system of convertibility.27

Ellul proposes that to study a specific technology, we cannot take it 
only as a tool but rather should approach it as a technical system.28 A tech-
nical system does not simply group its elements in a random manner but 
follows certain causalities and constitutes its own totality. The technical 
system evolves according to its own logic as if it has a kind of existence in 
itself. Technology is gradually “organizing itself as a closed world,”29 and 
the process also eliminates nontechnical factors.30 Yet one can find an iso-
morphism between different technical systems. At least on this point, we 
may observe that Ellul’s understanding comes from a parallel reading of 
Simondon’s technical evolution and von Neumann’s self- reproductive sys-
tem. Similar to Ellul, Bertrand Gille developed the concept of a technical 
system as a group of technics that depend on each other and maintain a 
certain coherence among themselves:

All the technics are to diverse degrees dependent on one another, 
and there needs to be a certain coherence between them: this 
ensemble of the different levels of coherence of all the structures, 
of all the ensembles and of all the procedures, composes what one 
can call a technical system.31

Gille’s concept of the technical system comes partly from Ellul. In fact, 
Gille, in the article “La notion de ‘système technique,’ ”32 criticized Ellul’s 
ignorance of another aspect of the technical system. Gille argued that 
one should approach the system through both its static and dynamic 



170 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

aspects, while Ellul only emphasizes the dynamic side, for example, self- 
reproduction. The static aspect of the technical system comprises struc-
tures that guarantee the internal coherences of different subsystems, en-
sembles, and objects. Thinking in this way, Gille’s analysis is closer to ours 
on digital objects, because the internal coherence depends so much on 
the standardization of technical infrastructures. Interobjective relations 
in a technical system need to be coherent so that each part affects every 
other. For Gille, it is better to discuss the compatibility of systems than 
their isomorphism; indeed, some systems may be able to connect to other 
systems, but this compatibility cannot be taken for granted. The difference 
between Ellul and Gille lies here, in Gille’s emphasis on the importance of 
a static structure as giving coherence, while Ellul focuses on the dynamic 
nature of a technical system that evolves by integrating referential relations 
into materializable interobjective relations. Here we are concerned with 
both aspects, because they present themselves as two orders of magnitude.

This thinking of the technical system leads us into two inquiries. First, 
we are concerned with the static interobjective structure of the system; sec-
ond, we are concerned with the dynamic restructuration of other systems 
that are connected to it. Gille has shown that the evolution of the technical 
system always entails a brutal and violent break from the human system 
(i.e., its social, political, and legal dimensions) to create the coherence of 
the technical system.33 In such a break, there are two consequences: first, 
the human system creates resistance to the evolution of the technical sys-
tem, and second, the human system has to change to adapt to the technical 
evolution. In the case of digitization, this restructuration becomes visible, 
materializable; later we will see how this facilitates a thinking toward what 
Simondon would called a quantic jump, which subsequently produces a 
transductive effect.

Information Systems and the Web

Ellul in his book partly explained why the phrase technical system has re-
placed technical milieu. For Ellul, the decisive moment was the invention 
of computers and the appearance of technologies of data processing. This 
is a main influence on the decision of this book to approach the digital in 
terms of data rather than binary codes. How can we constitute a techni-
cal system that materializes interobjective relations in a coherent way? The 
answer is through computers. For example, considering an urban database, 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 171

we observe that it connects together different components such as census 
results and water, telephone, power, transportation, and other networks. 
Hence, in fact, I think Ellul didn’t ignore the static part of the technical 
system; rather, he already saw data as the most important material forms 
of interobjective relations that allow the connecting of different parts. The 
most profound reality of the digital for me is not the realization of the bi-
nary operation but rather the realization of data processing. Ellul saw very 
clearly that the data processing capacity of computers has far exceeded 
that of humans:

Data processing solves the problem. Thanks to the computer, 
there emerged a sort of internal systematics of the technologi-
cal ensemble, expressing itself by, and operating on, the level of 
information. It is through reciprocal total and integrated informa-
tion that the subsystems are coordinated. This is something that 
no man, no human group, no constitution was able to do. The 
further technicization advanced, the more the technological sec-
tors tended to become independent, autonomous, and incoherent. 
Only the computer can deal with this. But it is quite obvious that 
it cannot be one computer. It has to be an ensemble of computers 
working interrelatedly at all communication points of the system. 
This ensemble becomes the subsystem of connections between 
the different technological subsystems.34

The technical system nowadays in the English- speaking world is known as 
the information system. We can probably say that the decisive invention 
of Ellul’s concept of the technical system is the emergence of the database. 
The computer scientist David Alan Grier showed a lineage of the devel-
opment of information systems from Vannevar Bush’s famous positional 
article titled “As We May Think,” published in the Atlantic Monthly.35 Bush 
imagined a future machine called Memex that would be more or less like 
a piece of equipment that uses microfilm as a storage system, such that 
the users can easily navigate through a large number of documents. Grier 
characterized this as the beginning of the concept of the information sys-
tem. The concept of information retrieval didn’t yet exist among those 
involved in the first generation of computers invented in 1940s, because 
they were more or less machines for calculation. In the 1950s, there were 
projects addressing information retrieval, notably at IBM, such as that 



172 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

which produced its Random Access Method of Accounting and Control 
(RAMAC) computer (1956). Until the beginning of the 1970s, many other 
practical projects were using database and search algorithms for informa-
tion retrieval. But as Grier noted, it was Codd’s invention of the relational 
database that realized the dream of the information system. Data process-
ing enters its historical stage in the 1970s and 1980s.

Grier also notes that in a conference celebrating the fiftieth anniver-
sary of Bush’s “As We May Think,” in the presence of pioneers in the field, 
such as Tim Berners- Lee, Ted Nelson, Alan Kay, and others, it was an-
nounced that “the WWW and the ubiquity of the Internet both in aca-
demic life and, increasingly, in commercial and personal spheres high-
lights the Web as the most widespread instantiation of Bush’s vision.” This 
for Grier also means the end of the information system, for, as he puts 
it, “if the Web was considered to be a database, it would fall well outside 
of Codd’s framework.”36 Grier argued that the emergence of the relational 
database in the history of information retrieval was closely related to busi-
ness models and development: “Codd developed a structure that allowed 
business people to focus on certain kinds of relationships. These relation-
ships determined how businesses thought about their customers, their 
bills, and their employees.”37

Grier’s argument could be backed up by other examples, such as the 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that have been used for the 
automatization of administrative and organizational procedures in com-
panies; one of the leading companies producing ERP software, Oracle, 
started as a database system. However, I don’t think that there is such a 
separation between information systems and the Web: the Web doesn’t 
replace information systems by eliminating the role of databases; instead, I 
would consider it the further materialization of finer relations as indicated 
by URIs. URIs are not even the hyperlinks of the 1980s and 1990s: they 
are smaller entities that indicate a subject, an object, a predicate (RDF). 
The finer division of relations also allows another level of automation. This 
means that the organizational structures and procedures that could be 
managed with a database are now further divided into finer materializable 
interobjective relations. For example, when we talked about the dataifica-
tion of things, we saw how logistics companies use RFID to turn objects 
into manageable and traceable digital data on the Web. Another example 
would be the use of digital objects in social systems, such as social net-
working sites, to capture social relations. In chapter 6, we will also look at 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 173

the realization of Jacob Moreno’s sociometry on Facebook as a means of 
capturing social relations in terms of digital objects.

Time as Interobjective Relation

Commenting on the emergence of technical systems, Ellul wrote, “It acts 
upon time, it produces time to the detriment— one I could say— of space. 
It creates time for man while reducing space.”38 Time is at the same time 
discursive and existential. It is probably fair to say that time is a core re-
lation of interobjectivity, and we can also observe the transformation of 
the world through the lens of time, thus posed here as interobjective rela-
tions rather than a pure flux or a subjective experience. We could prob-
ably derive a materialist interpretation of Heidegger in juxtaposition to 
the dominant existential readings. Pouring the wine out of the jug is an 
act of giving, a gift.39 Time is always given as a gift, and this givenness has 
to be united, gathered in a manner that allows us to experience the pro-
foundness of its existence, both for itself and in itself. To further clarify 
this point, we may pose another question: is there time in das Ding? Or is 
the temporality of the thing actually a subjective attribute? That is to say, 
is time objectively present inside the thing, or is it mind- dependent? We 
have seen that the philosopher Bernard Stiegler attempts to understand 
technics in terms of time or the tertiary retention. Time is just like space; 
it is not within the object, nor is it within the subject. Time is both the ex-
istential relations that define the finitude of Dasein and its everyday being 
and the external relations that are spatialized in technics. In comparison, 
Simondon was very clear on this point; when discussing the individuation 
of crystals, he wrote, “One could say that time is also relation, and there 
are only asymmetric veritable relations. Physical time exists as relation be-
tween an amorphous term and a structured term, the first being the carrier 
of potential energy, the second of an asymmetric structure.”40 Time acts as 
the relation that joins the two together, as the mediation of a casual link as 
well as a quantic jump; in this shift, what is amorphous becomes material 
and concrete.

Heidegger proposed a similar inquiry when he wrote, what is the past 
of the antiquities preserved in a museum? The tool was something ready- 
to- hand, but now it is something present- at- hand. Heidegger’s question 
about the historicity of antiquities problematizes his explanation of the 
ready- to- hand in division I of Being and Time:



174 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

By what right do we call this entity “historical,” when it is not yet 
past? Or do these “Things” have “in themselves” “something past,” 
even though they are still present- at- hand today? Then are these, 
which are present- at- hand, still what they were? . . . What, then is 
the past in this equipment? What were these “Things” which today 
they are no longer? They are still definite items of equipment for 
use; but they are out of use. Suppose, however, that they were still 
in use today, like many a household heirloom; would they then be 
not yet historical?41

In the same passage, Heidegger answers the question “what is ‘past’?” by 
saying “nothing else than that world within which they belonged to a 
context of equipment and were encountered as ready- to- hand and used 
by a concernful Dasein which was- in- the- world.”42 In other words, the 
past— that is, time— cannot be analyzed without referring to the relation 
between Dasein and its milieu; the ancient tool in the museum is called 
historical because it is removed from the world of the actual Dasein as 
ready- to- hand. The “was” suggests that interobjective relations cannot 
couple with the habits or knowledge of Dasein. This decoupling is due to 
the coming to pass of certain interobjective relations. The materialized 
contacts between steam and pistons, pistons and steam jackets, gears and 
chains, are displaced by other types of relations. It is true that the object 
shows itself as a tool in the context of its belongingness to equipmentality. 
An object enters different systems (technical, social, economic, political) 
according to different orders of magnitude. A hammer doesn’t just sig-
nify itself as something that is ready- to- hand but is also a commodity for 
Marxists, a product created by multiple machines and workers and com-
bined by a network of resources that comes with different means of logis-
tics. Objects are more durable than Dasein— as Simondon said, they are 
atemporal and universal. Even though they may have a life- span— being 
popular for some time— due to fashion, for example, they are immortal, 
as the poet Horace says: “Non omni moriar.”43 We see the multiplicity of 
time in the object as that which presents what is past and what is past to 
Dasein, which we call existential relations. The meaning of the object is 
always related to the specific milieu and system in which it dwells, but this 
meaning can be constituted, whereas it cannot be reduced to phenomena 
(e.g., the comparison of relations of different attributes, contacts) nor to 
pure temporality.



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 175

Time in Technical Systems

Heidegger’s contextualization of both tool and Dasein in a specific epoch 
of human history is also a contextualization of them in a technological sys-
tem that evolves over time. The equipment from a previous technological 
system is no longer usable in a new system, for example, the floppy disks 
that were once essential to every computer user are today totally obsolete. 
The past for Heidegger is not the perception of time but the incompati-
bility between Dasein and the instruments at hand. Now the question 
that interests us here is not the perception of time but rather the mode of 
existence of time in technical systems, whereby it renders obsolete some 
interobjective relations in favor of others. The presence of time in a techni-
cal system is not homogenous, as Heidegger describes clock time. Instead, 
clock time is only one of its possibilities. We will see in the following sec-
tions three interpretations of time in its material condition, including clock 
time, logical time, and topological time.

Clock Time

The clock time that Heidegger criticized in Being and Time is only one 
mode of existence of time in a technical system that serves the function of 
synchronization. In a technical system, the synchronization of technical 
objects is always triggered by different causalities. For example, in a bu-
reaucratic system, we always need to wait for a document to be passed to 
the right person. Within a digital system, we similarly have to synchronize 
with machine time. The computer scientist inspired by Heidegger, Philip 
Agre, illustrated this with an AND gate: the abstraction is the truth value of 
an output produced when two inputs are fed into the gate. The abstraction 
virtually doesn’t have time. Or, if it does, it is always the time of the instant. 
It is implemented by the physical arrival of the signal, which depends on 
the length and resistance of the line.44 Consider a much more complicated 
circuit that consists of many different electronic gates: the implementa-
tion (physicality) and the abstraction have to be synchronized; otherwise, 
incorrect outputs will be produced and the whole circuit will be in chaos. 
This synchronization can be implemented by a “clocking regime”:

Clocking schemes can become arbitrarily complicated, but the 
simplest one is called a “two- phase non- overlapping clock”; it 
signals tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, . . . for as long as the circuit 



176 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

is running, where tick means “Let us give the circuits some new 
values on their inputs” and tock means “Let us assume that the 
circuits have had sufficient time to settle down and that, conse-
quently, their outputs are now consistent with their inputs.”45

The clocking regime controls the physicality of the computer system. It is 
abstract time, which is distinguished from what Agre calls “real time.” The 
latter is “real” in the sense that it is human time. In this decoupling, the 
abstract time also dominates “real time,” for example, waiting. The parallel 
between these two systems of time points to a standardized clock time, 
which is used to control the physicality of the system, for example, syn-
chronizing geometrical distance. This synchronization at the same time 
gives us the illusion of nearness that was at the center of Heidegger’s cri-
tique. We could further investigate different orders of magnitude regarding 
synchronization. Let’s now look at the first level. Today, teleconferences 
between people in different parts of the world can be synchronized by 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).46 
To synchronize, there must be a universal standard that breaks the barriers 
of spatial and cultural limitations. Such standards are today the forces that 
shape the technological system in its various dimensions. The semantic 
web standard, as we have seen, is one of these forces; it attempts to inte-
grate with other forces in the name of interoperability and to consolidate 
the digital milieu as a unified technological system. This process of inte-
gration is at the same time the self- transformation of technical systems.

With this universal equivalent, difference can be eliminated by stan-
dardized transformations. Today, with the UTC standard, one can ignore 
geographical or cultural differences; for example, central Australia is not 
aligned with GMT, but we can now ignore this fact in an international tele-
conference meeting. In general, we can see this desire to move toward uni-
versal reduction as an attempt to bypass social and cultural differences and 
overcome geographical barriers. In our discussion of time, we saw that this 
reduction is so profound that it has reconfigured our relation with space. 
If we formerly understood time as a geometrical intuition that originated 
from the understanding of space, in the digital milieu, we are witnessing 
the opposite: space is determined by time, and this partly explains why the 
space of digital objects is unaddressable.

A quick flashback to the naval history of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries may inform our understanding here. In the seventeenth cen-



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 177

tury,47 a major problem for sailors was to determine the precise location 
of their ship at sea. As we are taught today, any place on the earth can be 
located by its latitude and longitude. Theoretically the latitude can be cal-
culated by measuring the angle between the sea and the sun or the polar 
stars using some instruments. But to do this was initially regarded as virtu-
ally impossible. Eventually, two ways of solving the problem were found: 
one was to make comparisons using a map of the stars for orientation, but 
as none of the existing maps in either Islamic or European culture were 
accurate, this also required expertise in astronomy. The other way was to 
calculate the latitude by the time difference. This is simple even for today’s 
primary school pupil; for example, there is a five- hour difference between 
New York and London, and every hour is equivalent to fifteen degrees lati-
tude, so there is a seventy- five- degree difference in total. But the problem 
was that the sailor had no way to synchronize this with GMT.

GMT is an abstract time: it can only be synchronized with space by 
the tool we now know as a clock. In the eighteenth century, the Dutchman 
Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock. This gave hope for ac-
curately representing time so that sailors would be able to synchronize 
with GMT. Unfortunately, even the most accurate pendulum clock, made 
by the Englishman George Graham, did not work at sea. Not until 1760, 
when the British technician John Harrison perfected his epoch- making 
clock, today known as H4, did naval navigation overcome its greatest 
obstacle. With the advance it made in time calculation, the East India 
Company was able to travel with unprecedented efficiency between India, 
China, and Great Britain, bringing fortune back to its country. The rela-
tion between time and space was reoriented. Clock time is now a supple-
ment to the abstract GMT, which in turn determines geographical forms. 
Today it is easy to overlook the historical relationship between time and 
space, as though they were separate entities. When people are using the 
GPS, they may not realize that their location is being determined by 260 
atomic clocks in forty- nine locations around the globe. Time is prior to 
space. In the digital milieu, we can see this technical heritage as an evolu-
tion that has continued since the project of GMT was introduced. Space is 
in any case derived from abstract time through the clock and manifests as 
two values of longitude and latitude; this geographical information is also 
often formalized as a digital object. This reorientation is projected from 
the technical system onto the human system, and in this redoubling of the 
who and the what, a new system is created based on the synchronization 



178 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

of time over telecommunication networks, which is today what one calls 
“real time”: an interaction without delay or waiting.

Logical Time

We can now explore the second order of magnitude of time, where time 
is passed from indications to instructions, from one synchronization to 
another level of synchronization. It is best exemplified in the ontology of 
time proposed by the W3C concerning the semantic web.48 The ontology 
of time in information systems is often based on earlier work by James 
Allen. What is intriguing in this specification is the concept of “topologi-
cal temporal relations.” I think it will be fruitful to compare this with the 
third order of time to be discussed here, which we may call topological 
time. Time in contemporary technology is commonly understood as 
consisting of measurable units assisting the system of synchronization 
or calendarity. This abstraction gives digital objects of time in the digital 
milieu. By the “ontology of time,” the researchers of the semantic web 
propose to understand time according to three different aspects: (1) to-
pological temporal relations, (2) measuring durations, and (3) clock and 
calendar. These three aspects originate from their practicality, but at the 
same time they also produce a new form of time in the perception of digi-
tal objects.

Researchers on the semantic web Jerry Hobbes and Feng Pan consider 
two basic units of time, namely, instants and intervals. An instant is the 
basic unit specifying a moment; an interval is specified by two instants, 
indicating its beginning and end points. Based on interval and instant, the 
user is able to specify first the topological temporal relations that exist be-
tween different temporal entities, for example, before, after, during. These 
topological temporal relations specify the happening of events as well as 
the sequence of their occurrence. These topological temporal relations 
are actually logical propositions stating the sequence of the occurrence 
of events. There are two categories of temporal relations: one is “before,” 
and the other comprises interval relations, which include “intervalequal,” 
“intervalbefore,” “intervalmeets,” “intervaloverlaps,” “intervalstarts,” “in-
tervalduring,” and so on. I will quote two examples by the authors that 
demonstrate a temporal relation “before” and an interval relation intEqual 
(equal intervals):



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 179

e.g.1 ‘Before’. It says for all (∀time entities T1 and T2, if T1 is before 
T2, it implies that there exists (∃ t1 and t2, the ending time of T1 
(t1) is before the beginning time of T2(t2)

(∀ T1,T2)[before(T1,T2) ≡ (∃ t1,t2)[ends(t1,T1) ∧ begins(t2,T2) 
∧ before(t1,t2)]]49

e.g.2 ‘intEqual’. It says that for all time entities T1 and T2, if T1 and 
T2 have equal intervals, then it implies that T1 and T2 are all 
intervals and for all time t1, the beginning time of T1 is the same 
as the beginning time of T2, and both of them have the same 
ending time.

(∀ T1,T2)[intEquals(T1,T2) ≡ [ProperInterval(T1) ∧ 
ProperInterval(T2) ∧ (∀ t1)[begins(t1,T1) ≡ begins(t1,T2)] ∧ 
(∀ t)[ends(t,T) ≡ ends(t,T)]]]50

Second, the duration of an interval is understood as an arithmetical cal-
culation based on current temporal standards, such as day, hour, minute, 
or second. The authors also specify relationships between different inter-
vals, for example, through the two predicates “concatenation” and “hath.” 
A larger temporal unit is a concatenation of smaller temporal units, and a 
hath specifies the number of smaller unit intervals that concatenate to a 
larger interval. In other words, they specify the relations between mem-
bers inside the set of that which constitutes the particular large interval. 
Third, the user can adopt the current representation of time zones and cal-
endars into this ontology to synchronize different users and events.

Before we proceed with the analysis, I must make two remarks here. 
First, there are many other representations of temporalities based on dif-
ferent philosophies. For example, in Bergson’s duration, “instants” are not 
logical units of time, because for him, a duration cannot be understood as 
a sequence of instants.51 Second, the “topological temporal relations” are 
for us again interobjective relations that come from the division of time 
into different units and the topological relations between these units, such 
as before, equal, during, overlap, start, and finish.52 These are discursive re-
lations from which one can derive the comparison of certain properties.53 
The concept of topological time is investigated by Heidegger in Being and 
Time as a hermeneutic structure of past, present, and future. Heidegger 
criticized clock time as not being authentic, viewing it as a mechanical 
experience that delimits the temporal ecstasy of Dasein. Topological time 



180 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

refers to the existential relation that is revealed by the object in its cou-
pling with Dasein (but that does not arise from Dasein or the object itself).

Topological Time

This topological time demands objects in which time rests, just as the past 
manifests itself in the incomparability that characterizes Dasein’s encoun-
tering of equipment that is no longer ready- to- hand. Certainly we can 
think about our past, about what we ate yesterday, whom we talked to the 
day before, but this remembering of the past is not experiencing the past 
in a bodily way, as in the encountering of an ancient piece of equipment 
in a museum. Within Heidegger’s thought, technical reality is taken as 
“already there” instead of being explicitly interrogated. If such an experi-
ence of time relies on objects, one can also think of Heidegger’s “already 
there” as something retrievable through such a calendar and the synchro-
nized nature of time. Without the mechanical or digital clock, the sun, 
the moon, the stars, can be indicators of the divisibility of time. These im-
precise measurements become a binding force that brings the landscapes 
and Dasein together. We can see here again the motif of das Ding. Because 
precision is the source of separation, technical processes would not exist 
without it and would be undone by a return to such referential relations 
(using heavenly bodies as the basis for a sense of time). Alternatively, we 
have to recognize the technical nature of time, which was already indi-
cated by the observation of stars within a technical ensemble and slowly 
materialized and retained within a technical system. We demand a mate-
rial view of time in the digital milieu, one that complicates the critique of 
clock time. I suggest here that we turn our attention to another concept of 
topological time suggested by French philosopher Michel Serres and by 
Ilya Prigogine, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, because I think 
they provide us with a more material understanding of time that is nev-
ertheless close to Heidegger’s. Serres doesn’t consider time as a flow but 
rather as something material, which percolates:

[Time] passes, and also it doesn’t pass. We must bring the word 
pass closer to passoir— “sieve.” Time doesn’t flow; it percolates. 
This means precisely that it passes and doesn’t pass. I am very fond 
of the theory of percolation, which tells us things that are evident, 
concrete, decisive, and new about space and time.54



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 181

Time is something to be filtered; some of it passes away, while some of 
it is retained in the objects or circumstances. Like a pot of food passing 
through a passoir, some percolates (percoler), while some passes away. 
However, there is still a big difference between this visual image and time, 
for with time, what is retained is not simply physical matter (e.g., in the 
form of vegetables or beans) but rather something of a specific “order.” 
To further convey his model of time, Serres suggests this: “sketch on the 
handkerchief some perpendicular networks, like Cartesian coordinates, 
and you will define the distances. But, if you fold it, the distance from 
Madrid to Paris could suddenly be wiped out, while, on the other hand, 
the distance from Vincennes to Colombes could become infinite . .  . the 
time we spontaneously use imitates the succession of natural integers.”55 
The geometrical intuition of time as a line that runs from one end to an-
other is metrical. Serres’s topological model disrupts this intuition by ar-
guing that time opens up, converges, explodes. Not only is the future of 
an event unpredictable but the propagation of time itself is unpredictable. 
Time itself is a network, that is to say, relations expressed in and through 
different objects:

Earlier I took the example of a car, which can be dated from several 
eras; every historical era is likewise mutitemporal, simultaneously 
drawing from the obsolete, the contemporary, and the futuristic. 
An object, a circumstance, is thus polychromic, multitemporal, and 
reveals a time that is gathered together, with multiple pleats.56

Serres’s topological time is isomorphic with Prigogine’s “internal time,” 
though Prigogine develops the latter from physics. As a supplement to 
Serres’s understanding, Prigogine’s theory points to the misconception 
of temporality in modern science. In his lecture “The Rediscovery of 
Time,” which addresses the irreversibility of time in quantum mechanics, 
Prigogine criticized the fact that in theoretical physics, there is no place 
for history. He doesn’t mean the history of science but rather the fact that 
the concept of the past always consists of the presence of time itself, which 
is also what we call the “technical reality.” Especially for a highly unstable 
system, it doesn’t make much sense to give descriptions in terms of tra-
jectory because physical motion effectively becomes meaningless; yet it is 
possible to describe the system in terms of partitions. When it is described 
in partitions, we can only know it in terms of phase space rather than in its 



182 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

exact state, which means we have to understand it according to a different 
time from that of classical mechanics:

A basic feature of highly unstable systems, which was recognised 
by B. Misra, is that we may introduce for such systems a new con-
cept, corresponding to the “internal time” or “internal age.” Internal 
time is quite different from the usual parameter time, which I can 
read on my watch. It corresponds more closely to the question 
which I ask when I meet a stranger and I wonder how old he is. 
Obviously the answer will depend on the overall appearance. His 
age cannot be read from the colour of the hair, the wrinkles on the 
skin. It depends on the global aspect.57

The stranger may show us different traces of temporality, but to estimate 
his age, we need to reassemble these traces. They don’t correspond to a 
moment on the clock but rather always already correspond to a topologi-
cal temporality. In the equipment that is present- at- hand in the antiquity 
museum, we don’t see the exact past of the object (e.g., who exactly was 
using the tool, when exactly it was used), but we nevertheless “see” what 
is retained there as past. That is to say, time, owing to its divisibility and 
the basis for this divisibility, gives us historicity. These temporal residues 
in objects couple with Dasein’s knowledge to produce existential relations 
intrinsic to the context and the milieu. Percolation demands multiple 
objects to form a topology of time: as with a town, where time might be 
considered a property manifest in the different ages of the buildings but 
is retained in a different manner within the town as a technical system 
(linked by electricity, telephone, water pipes, roads, etc.). The ontology of 
the time of digital objects considered as a sequence of events, for example, 
registered in the time stamps of its creation, modification, and deletion, 
also gives us a third order that has to be understood as a topology of per-
colated time in material terms. “Topological temporal relations” have their 
significance in the way they allow us to grasp topological temporality in 
material terms. Again, this third material order can be seen as the contin-
gency effect of particular technics. The givenness of topological temporal-
ity is associated with the topological temporal relations— the interobjec-
tive relations that previously existed in memory, in notepads, in calendars, 
are now ubiquitously present in all types of digital objects.



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 183

The Limit of Technical Progress and Convergences

Digital objects concretize interobjective relations and allow a system to 
be established: this can probably be understood as the vision of the se-
mantic web or a web to come. They not only connect things together but 
also concretize time in a topological form that one can navigate. Within 
the digital milieu, we are living in topological temporalities that become 
more and more explicit and predictable. Time becomes affective, not only 
because it gives existential relations, but also because it becomes more 
and more discursive and precise. The central point of this chapter is that 
intersubjectivity as a means of cultural analysis can be supplemented by 
another pole: the study of interobjectivity through a systematic under-
standing of relations and the process of materialization. A system cannot 
be established without the materialization of interobjectivity and without 
structures that render these relations coherent. Rendering coherent is also 
a process of synchronization; to give a simple example, the action of the 
finger upon the keyboard would not produce the desired effect if there 
were no materialization of the relation between the key, the value of the key, 
the register, the accumulator, the cathode rays, and the screen. The analysis 
of interobjectivity implies the displacement of intersubjectivity, moving 
from a subject- centered discourse to a more object- centered approach: 
the Cartesian subject characterized by “I think” and the Humean subject 
who says “I compare” are slowly dissolved in technological development 
and are integrated as a function or functions of the technical system. In 
an article titled “The Limit of Human Progress,” responding to an earlier 
article of the same title from the philosopher Raymond Ruyert in Revue 
de métaphysique et de morale (1958), Simondon sees the shift of systems as 
having gone from a system of man-language to the system of man- religion 
and now moving to a system of man- technics. For in transitional phases, 
humans found more resonances internal to the system, from language to 
religion and now to technical objects. Resonance means that there is a pro-
cess of internalization and systemization that constantly concretizes what has 
been meditative and modifies the relation between human beings and the 
world (from language to religion to technical objects). Simondon hence 
commented on the systematization of technics:

The real centre of systematization shifts. At first it is to be found 
between man and the objective concretisation. Little by little, it is 



184 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

the objective concretisation alone which constitutes the system. 
Man is ex- centred, the concretisation mechanises and automates 
itself; language becomes grammar and religion theology.58

Time is artificially constituted in a technological system, but it is never-
theless the reality that we live. Synchronization resulting from the devel-
opment of concrete and material interobjective relations presents us with 
the danger of freedom, because we may ask: being in a more and more 
concrete technical system, does it not necessarily imply being in con-
stant control? We can see this question of the relation between technic-
ity and control being asked in different ways by different thinkers, notably 
through Deleuze’s societies of control and Heidegger’s critique of modern 
technologies as essentially enframing (Gestell). What is the position of the 
human being in technical systems as such? Heidegger asked, “Where are 
we now? We have arrived at the insight that for the call ‘to the thing itself ’ 
what concerns philosophy as its matter is established from the outset.”59 
To retrieve the da of Da- sein, Heidegger offers a solution through appro-
priating a new kind of interobjective relation. There is a nuance to this that 
we have to reinstate here. At the beginning, we characterized Heidegger 
as a thinker of interobjective relations, because he didn’t only discover the 
interobjective relations present in equipmentalities as significations, con-
tacts, but also wanted to provoke a new type of interobjective relation, one 
that dematerializes itself, for example, in the case of heaven, earth, god, 
and mortals. These new relations resonate with Heidegger’s interpreta-
tion of the mission of metaphysics: “thinks beings as a whole— the world, 
man, God— with respect to Being, with respect to the belonging together 
of beings in Being.”60

It would be easy to set up an opposition between Simondon and Hei-
degger, but Simondon didn’t celebrate the fact that humans are displaced 
from the center, because this also constitutes one of the conditions of 
alienation in which the human loses its role as the technical individual. 
We can identify in the thought of both Heidegger and Simondon a strong 
concept of convergence as a remedy to this situation: for Heidegger, it 
is Ding as dinc, as gathering; for Simondon, the philosophical task is to 
find a new way to reunite the divergence of technics and religions, theory 
and practice, and restore the role of human beings as technical individu-
als. In fact, speaking about convergence, Simondon referred directly to 



 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS 185

Heidegger: “the thought that recognized the nature of the technical reality 
is the one that, going beyond the separated objects, the utensils, according 
to the expression of Heidegger, discovers the essence and the meaning of 
technical organisation, beyond the separated objects and the specialised 
professions.”61 But what is meant by convergence here? Simondon pro-
posed two directions. One would be to restore the encyclopedism of the 
Enlightenment, whereby each individual should study and acquire a suf-
ficient level of technical knowledge. This question concerning pedagogy 
has today been realized in a certain sense through Wikipedia and similar 
websites, hacker spaces that effectively cultivate the culture of the ama-
teur. The other direction is that of a reconstitution of reticulation through 
philosophical thought, with the aim of transforming the key points, and 
hence the technical system itself, from within. It is precisely on the sec-
ond point that we are confronted with the uncertainty of Simondon’s 
thought as well as the challenge it leaves us. Because Simondon didn’t live 
in a time when networks were so dominant as they are in ours, the net-
work remained something to be given rather than created:

one changes tools and instruments, one can construct or repair 
a tool oneself, but one cannot change the network, one doesn’t 
construct oneself a network: one can only tie in with the network, 
adapt to it, participate in it; network dominates and encloses 
[enserrer] the action of individual beings, dominates even every 
technical ensemble.62

Today we may not be able to change communication networks in terms 
of transatlantic cables, but we are able to establish social networks, file net-
works, data networks, by using Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Dropbox, 
and so on. But on the other hand, can we consider the realization of a tech-
nical system qua network as actually having given us the new possibility 
that Simondon dreamed of ? Heidegger sought to find new relations by 
reaching outside the technical system, whereas Simondon wanted to find 
a solution from within. Heidegger proposed mediative and poetic think-
ing as a new possibility, that is also to say, a nontechnical imagination, 
going back to language. In contrast, Simondon, like Bertrand Gille, sees 
modification of structure as the ultimate possibility for human beings to 
rediscover the remedy within the technical system itself:



186 THE TIME OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

Transforming all the conditions of human life, augmenting the 
exchange of causality between what man produces and what he is, 
true technical progress might be considered as implying human 
progress if it has a network structure, whose mesh is human reality; 
but then it would no longer be solely an ensemble of objective 
concretizations.63

In Simondon’s own vocabulary, this demands a thought that seeks a mar-
gin of indetermination for the design of technical objects. It allows an en-
semble with more flexibilities by leaving it open. It is necessary to think of 
a more perfect system than automation. Automation here means a closed 
system with overdetermination, and for Simondon, such is only a low level 
of perfection of technical objects. From the discussions of chapter 1 to the 
account of interobjective relations and technical system in this chapter, 
we have unfolded a technical reality that we are living and the technical 
tendency that already lies ahead of us. Now, if we understand that both 
Heidegger and Simondon point to a higher degree of convergence, in 
comparison with the one that is brought about by network technologies, 
then how can we imagine this higher degree of convergence in an already 
converged technical system? To reconsider convergence, we can no lon-
ger take the notion of network for granted as signifying convergence in its 
totality. Instead, Simondon and Heidegger point to types of logic that are 
more profound than efficient connections and reticulations: on one hand, 
a logic of convergence that points to an intuitive thinking beyond objecti-
fication, namely, whose role is to think about the “thingness” of the thing; 
on the other hand, a logic of convergence that needs to be reinvented in-
side the technical systems against the alienation effected by them. Hence 
a return to the discussions of object-logic and language-logic will be the 
task of Part III.

Logic and Object

In the first two parts, we studied the concept of relations, which allows us to move away from the conception of objects as representa-
tions as well as allowing us to proceed from objects to systems. At the end 
of chapter 4, we left a question to be answered in Part III: the question 
of convergence as a philosophical task proposed by both Heidegger and 
Simondon. This is not only an interpretation of digital objects but also 
demands a consideration of the future development of digital objects. 
The answer is a “return to things themselves.” For Simondon, this means 
a return to technical objects; for Heidegger, it means establishing the on-
tological difference between objects and things. Our solution will also 
be to go back to digital objects, both to their technical components and 
to their working principles. Hence logic, the most fundamental aspect of 
computation, cannot be avoided. Before us is the philosophical task of 
answering the following question: what kind of logic would make it pos-
sible to produce a new type of reticulation in favor of convergence? This is the 
main question of this chapter, which proposes to address it by seeking a 
logic of the kind that Simondon calls transductive for the conceptualiza-
tion of digital objects. I decided to go back to Husserl here, not only be-
cause Husserl is the originator of the slogan “back to things themselves,” 
but also because it will be valuable to retrieve what Husserl calls inten-
tional logic, which was a critique of the formal logic or extensional logic 
of Frege and others. Husserl’s effort was to develop a logic that would be 
both formal and intentional. The debate between Husserl and Frege has 
rarely been addressed in computational theory. This chapter argues that 
the intentional logic can serve as a point of departure for the develop-
ment of a transductive logic in the sense of Simondon. This will consist of 
a reflection on Husserlian phenomenology, whose key gesture is under-
mining the pure ego, as well as (if at all possible) enacting a reconciliation 
between Simondon and Husserl.



190 LOGIC AND OBJECT

Toward a Transductive Logic

If being- in- the- world has to be interpreted as being- in- a- technical- system, 
then Heidegger’s proposition could be read as an attempt to introduce 
new categories, which preserve the system and present it from a totally 
different perspective. When we ask ourselves how to understand a jug in 
terms of mortals, the divine, heaven and earth, we may feel we are faced 
with a joke: does the jug really have anything to do with the divine? If 
Heidegger succeeds, he will be able to bring this theological understand-
ing back to things. This understanding may not affect the way the jug is 
produced and circulated, but it will at least transform how it is perceived 
and handled (Zen Buddhism can give us such an example). The jug hence 
regains a magical power that serves as a key point of convergence. For 
Heidegger, to move from objects to things, which is also the basis of a 
critique of formal logic (as is explained in chapter 6), is the fundamental 
project. For Simondon, classical logic constitutes an obstacle to thinking 
about individuation because “it requires that the operation of individua-
tion be thought using concepts and relationships between concepts that 
only apply to the results of the operation of individuation, considered 
in a partial manner.”1 We can understand that there is certain rigidity in 
classical logic, in which relations only come from a predefined concept, 
whereby moving from one relation to another also implies moving from 
one concept to another.

Such thinking is not a question of aesthetics. It seems that we can do 
many things with an interface; we can build different interactions within 
the limits of binary code, computational languages and hardware, and so 
on. These interfaces will produce effects that go far beyond the rigid logi-
cal limits. So are we to leave the lower- level abstractions intact as long as 
higher- level implementations are possible? I think this is why Simondon 
wants to distinguish aesthetic thought and philosophical thought, assign-
ing to aesthetic thought the convergence effect of the primary level and to 
philosophical thought, because it always aims at fundamentals, the second 
level of convergence. For Simondon, the aesthetic impression is only ef-
fective in the first modality of bifurcation of magic power into technics 
and religions; in the second modality of bifurcation, where technics and 
religions, respectively, produced their own practical and theoretical parts, 
aesthetic impressions are no longer powerful enough to serve the purpose 
of convergence, which thus becomes the task of philosophical thinking 
able to engage with the technical system. Simondon commented:



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 191

One can learn a poem, contemplate a pictorial work, but this 
doesn’t mean that one can learn poetry and painting: the essence 
of the thought is not transmitted by expression, because these 
different types of thoughts are mediations between man and the 
world, and do not emerge from the encounter between subjects: 
they don’t suppose a modification of an intersubjective system.2

Hence, for Simondon, instead of aesthetic thought, philosophical thought 
is the penetrating force that will be able to produce a convergence effect 
in the later stage of technological development. That is to say, it is not the 
perception of objects that matters but rather the modification of the in-
terobjective and intersubjective system.3 Philosophical thought is able to 
produce a force in favor of transduction, given that this thought is funda-
mentally relational. This also constitutes the task of the previous parts of 
this book, that is, to constitute a theory of relations. Transduction in my 
reading also implies convergence, which concerns the interoperability and 
compatibility (as well as incompatibility) between humans and machines, 
seeing them as a structure that is at the same time individual and collec-
tive. Transduction is not a pure becoming but rather a rupture that recon-
figures the structure of both the being and its milieu. We can say that the 
shift from analog to digital produces transductions in different domains of 
society. This also corresponds to our previous discussion of the difference 
between milieu and context, because a change in context is a change in 
information, while the change in milieu is a change in structure. A change 
in information can trigger a change in structure, but it is not entirely cor-
respondent to transduction in the milieu; hence in this chapter we explore 
this change in context as informational change, which in turn provides the 
motivation for a transduction.

To be more precise, transduction for Simondon means both a struc-
tural change and an amplification process. Transduction comes from the 
Latin prefix trans-  (across) and ducere (to lead), thus meaning a “lead[ing] 
along or across, transfer.”4 Transduction signifies a process or an action 
that leads to a transformation across different domains. In fact, already in 
the philosophy of Descartes, the “pineal gland” serves as a transductor. For 
Descartes, all the stimuli are accumulated in the pineal gland before they 
are submitted to the soul. He thinks the pineal gland has a special position 
because it is the only part of the body that is not doubled (i.e., we have two 
of everything else— eyes, ears, etc.).5 The pineal gland is the transductor 



192 LOGIC AND OBJECT

that connects the soul and the body by translating or transferring the stim-
uli into the language of the soul. In engineering terms, a transducer is a 
device “for converting energy from one form to another for the purpose of 
measurement of a physical quantity or for information transfer,”6 as in, for 
example, the transducer that converts cathode rays into images.

Simondon retains the technical meaning of transduction as a means of 
communication and transmission. Furthermore, he identifies transduc-
tion as the third way of reasoning beyond (and juxtaposing) induction 
and deduction, giving rise to a type of thinking that doesn’t move uni-
directionally from inside to outside, outside to inside, individual to col-
lective, collective to individuals, but rather presents itself as a process of 
the transformation of forms and structures.7 It will be also useful to think 
of transducer and transduction together, that is to say, to identify techni-
cal objects as transducers in the process of individuation. Simondon often 
uses the example of crystallization to illustrate the process of individua-
tion. When a supersaturated solution is heated, it starts to crystallize; the 
ions then take on the structure of “crystallization germs,” releasing energy 
that propagates from part to part and triggers further crystallization. Here 
we see two phenomena: first, a process of amplification, as the transmis-
sion of germs is sped up because of the energy released during crystal-
lization; and second, the creation of tensions between ions, which are re-
solved through crystallization to achieve a metastable state:

A crystal, which from a very small germ, grows and extends in 
every direction in its water- mother, provides the simplest image of 
transductive operation; every molecular layer already constituted 
serves as the structuring base of the layer in process of formation; 
the result is an amplifying reticular structure. Transductive opera-
tion is an individuation in progress.8

Transduction is a new form of convergence in the sense illustrated by 
crystallization. The transductive condition for Simondon always mani-
fests in a systematic way, being simultaneously energetic, material, and 
informational. Transduction happens when these conditions are modi-
fied in such a way that a threshold is overcome. Transduction is essen-
tially relational. For this reason, Simondon distinguished the knowledge 
of relations and the knowledge of phenomena. Meanwhile, in chapter 3, 
we have already seen that phenomena are themselves relations and can be 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 193

extended to other relations. Our question is, if formal logic is the founda-
tion of digital objects, can we still imagine a transductive logic of digital 
objects? Simondon himself is not a logician, hence to directly confront the 
question of logic, we need to move to Husserl, while having Simondon in 
the background and constantly looking for dialogues. This link between 
Husserl and Simondon was first made by Deleuze in A Thousand Plateaus, 
where he showed that Husserl developed a protogeometry— a science that 
deals with something “anexact yet rigorous.”9 Deleuze gives an example of 
roundness, which is not exact as a circle (that is, ideal), but neither is it an 
inexact sensible being. It is instead anexact. Deleuze proposes that this can 
be compared to Simondon’s critique of hylomorphism, because both gave 
an intensive dimension to matter.10 As we have already seen in the previ-
ous chapters, Simondon’s critique aims to bring forward an operational 
or process thinking. Such operation takes form as one source of informa-
tion, which is essentially intensive. This comparison between Husserl and 
Simondon serves as an invitation to mediate on two orders of magnitudes: 
the sensible, formal, and noetic order of Husserl and the material, informa-
tional, and technical order of Simondon. To start with, we should elucidate 
Husserl’s position as a logician.

Logic and Ontology

The interpretation of the relation between logic and ontologies, from 
Aristotle onward, is rather controversial. Some philosophers see no differ-
ence between ontologies and logic in the thought of Aristotle, for whom 
ontology is the theory of category and logic denotes the rules of reasoning: 
“the principal method of ontology has been one or another form of cate-
gorical analysis, depending on whether the analysis was directed upon the 
structure of reality, as in Aristotle’s case, or upon the structure of thought 
and reason, as, e.g., in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.”11 According to some 
philosophers, Aristotle wanted to develop a theory of being by consider-
ing both logos and physis, that is to say, through an inquiry that was both 
logical and ontological.12 In both cases, it seems natural to deduce that on-
tology actually implies logic; for example, making a distinction between 
male and female already implies a logical negation, an element of reason-
ing that is indispensable in the thinking of ontologies. The Stoics rejected 
this idea of a common ground between logic and ontology, on the basis 
that logic comprises the rules of argument, while ontology has to do with 



194 LOGIC AND OBJECT

categories and with what exists as such. The Scholastic logicians also made 
a distinction between the two, calling ontology “first intentions” (meaning 
concepts abstracted directly from physical reality) and calling logic “sec-
ond intentions,” because they are “concepts abstracted wholly from the 
‘material’ content of first intentions, as well as such categorical concepts 
as individual, proposition, universal, genus, species, property, etc., and so- called 
syncategorematic concepts such as negation.”13 The emergence of formal 
logic after the nineteenth century seems to further separate it from meta-
physics (though metaphysics is still a core subject in analytic philoso phy).14 
Yet, when ontologies and logic are implemented on a computational ma-
chine, ontology and logic converge again, and therefore Husserl’s pro-
gram of binding formal logic and formal ontology outlined in Formal and 
Transcendental Logic has prepared us for our excursion.

The idea of web ontology today actually synthesizes the two: a formal 
logic regulates the description of what exists. According to the philoso-
pher and logician Bochenski, formal logic is “a theory of a general sort of 
object” and “logic as it is now conceived, has a subject matter similar to 
that of ontology.”15 Especially in automation, categorization is meaning-
less without a logic to provide the means of enabling inference. The use 
of formal ontology in information science alongside that of classification 
also focuses on the validity and truth of statements.16 The Web Ontology 
Language (OWL) proposed by the W3C is influenced by quite a few in-
dustrial standards, for example, the RDF, the frames paradigm, and, most 
important, Description Logic (DL).17 DL is a restricted subset of the first- 
order logic (FOL) formalized by Frege,18 the difference between them 
being that DL is decidable, meaning that given a logical statement, the sys-
tem will be able to tell if such as statement is true from inferences. OWL is 
a subset of DL that preserves some of its computational functions accord-
ing to their specific uses; for example, a complete DL is a powerful tool for 
the logician to use in verifying the consistency of the system, but it is too 
powerful for semantic web use.19 The expressiveness of logical language 
decreases from FOL to OWL, but the syntax becomes more and more 
flexible.20 OWL builds on DL and is less a theorem prover, more a proof 
validator: it cannot verify whether an answer is correct, but it “can follow a 
simple explanation that an answer is correct.”21

Frege’s intention to build a lingua characteristica to serve as the founda-
tion of mathematics is a vision comparable to that of Berners- Lee of the 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 195

semantic web, which he also calls a “language of logic.”22 This language 
of logic is not new, as it can be traced back to a range of precedents, from 
Frege, Cantor, Hilbert, Gödel, and Turing to Boole, De Morgan, and 
Leibniz. But it is only in Frege that such a language of logic is possible. 
Boole’s logic was still a branch of mathematics to be developed by ordinary 
mathematical logic, whereas Frege wanted to reverse this order by render-
ing mathematics as symbolic logic.23 By using an innovative method of no-
tation, Frege developed a formal system that he called the Begriffsschrift. 
The Begriffsschrift is able to account for all human deductive reasoning. In 
his 1930 doctoral dissertation, Gödel proved that Frege’s rules were com-
plete as an answer to the question raised by Hilbert.24 It was Turing who 
later took up Hilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem and discovered the universal 
machine. The Entscheidungsproblem can be generalized as the search for an 
algorithm that can reduce all human deductive reasoning to calculation.25 
We go into the history of the universal machine in more detail in chap-
ter 6; for now it is important to note that its development is more or less 
centered on Frege’s concept and system of logic. Of course, it wouldn’t be 
fair to say that modern logic is not very different from classical FOL or to 
reduce the semantic web movement to the Fregean project. For example, 
it is significant that Hilbert’s mathematical formalism already combined 
Frege’s logic with mathematical axioms to refine FOL into propositional 
logic. But in DL, the core Fregean FOL features, such as the distinction 
between concept and object, the meaning of term and of predicate, remain 
unchanged.26

Object and Concept in Logic

Frege’s philosophy of logic is not as abstract as the symbolic systems one 
encounters today. Frege assigned a very high status to the concept, which 
for him is “something primitive which cannot be dispensed with in logic.” 
Without a concept, there will be no class and set. So, when an object is in a 
set, it is already subsumed under a concept. Frege distinguishes the object- 
expression from the concept- expression in his Begriffsschrift: a concept- 
expression plays “a predicative role in the sentences in which it appears,” 
whereas an object- expression stands “for that which is said to fall under 
a concept in the sentences in which it appears”;27 for example, “— — is a 
horse” denotes a concept, whereas “Black Beauty is a horse” is a simple 
predicate of an object that falls under the concept:



196 LOGIC AND OBJECT

We can only determine a class by giving the properties which an 
object must have in order to belong to the class. But these proper-
ties are the characteristics [Merkmale] of a concept. We define a 
concept, and past over from it to the class.28

Yet the concept is not the most fundamental element of logic. In “On Con-
cept and Object,”29 Frege responded to a challenge from Benno Kerry and 
produced one of his most interesting and “paradoxical” arguments: the 
concept horse is not a concept. This is very significant, because for Frege, 
in FOL, we cannot talk about concepts but only about objects. Kerry pro-
posed that in the sentence “The concept horse is a concept easily attained,” 
“the concept horse” serves as both a concept and an object, because the 
proposition tautologically says that “a concept is a concept,” while also al-
lowing it to remain an object according to Frege’s analysis. Frege rejected 
this counterproposal and said that “the concept horse is not a concept”; 
then is “the city of Berlin” a city or even “the volcano Vesuvius” a vol-
cano? Frege recognized the “awkwardness” of his expression. Indeed, he 
wrote, “By a kind of necessity of language, my expressions taken literally, 
sometimes miss my thought; I mention an object, when what I intend is a 
concept. I fully realize that in such cases I was relying upon a reader who 
would be ready to meet me halfway— who does not begrudge a pinch of 
salt.”30 To mitigate this awkwardness, Frege explains that in the FOL, to 
talk about a concept, we necessarily have to convert it into an object or 
let “the object go[] proxy.” The reason for this, according to Frege, is that 
in his system, a concept, unlike an object, cannot be the subject and thus 
subsumed under the predicate. It is very significant that in the OWL, there 
must be an URI to indicate the object, even if it is spoken of as though it 
were a concept. A digital object, for example, a YouTube video, falls within 
different concepts/ontologies and acts as an instance of these classes, which 
can then be reassembled as a “complete” object.31

For Frege, the concept horse when expressed in language is no longer 
a concept but rather an object with which we can describe. The proper 
name Black Beauty gives us a description of this horse. We know that it 
is beautiful and black. Frege set up a system of meaning in language, in 
which proper names are not simply denotations. Accordingly, the truth of 
a logical statement or a sentence for Frege must go beyond the intuitive 
understanding of a predicate asserting an object. The object in question is 
not a pure symbol. Frege and Russell’s critique of John Stuart Mill focuses 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 197

on the fact that Mill understands proper names as symbols that don’t nec-
essarily carry true meanings. An example is the name of the English town 
Dartmouth; Mill holds the view that even if the river Dart changed its 
course so that Dartmouth was no longer the mouth of the Dart, we could 
still call it Dartmouth, regardless of the meaning carried by the compound 
word. In contrast, Frege holds the view that names do have meaning. To 
differentiate relations, Frege introduces two ambiguous concepts, namely, 
Sinn and Bedeutung. In everyday German, these two words mean more 
or less the same thing: “meaning.” The English translations of the title of 
Frege’s article “Über Sinn und Bedeutung” have varied, because it literally 
amounts to “On Meaning and Meaning”; here we take the most common 
translation, “On Sense and Reference.” Frege first talked about the Sinn 
and Bedeutung of proper names and later extended this discussion to the 
analysis of predication:

A proper name (word, sign, sign combination, expression) expresses 
its sense, stands for or designates its reference. By means of a sign 
we express its sense and designate its reference.32

We can illustrate the difference, using Frege’s own example, by consider-
ing “morning star” and “evening star.” They both have the same reference 
(Bedeutung) to Venus, but they have different senses (Sinn). In this way, 
meaning is made a matter of identity, and reference is concerned with ob-
jects. But Frege continues nevertheless to say that the reference must be 
prioritized as the major criterion in the accessing of logic: “The logic books 
contain warnings against logical mistakes arising from the ambiguity of ex-
pressions. I regard as no less pertinent a warning against apparent proper 
names having no reference.”33 When Frege extends meaning and reference 
to a sentence, we observe something peculiar. Frege calls an expression 
that completes the proper name a “functional expression or unsaturated 
expression.” Consider a complete expression like “5 + 8”: the sign “+” is 
a functional expression because it completes the expression. A predicate 
for Frege has the same role as a functional expression. Frege understands 
the predicate as an “expression got from a sentence by removing one or 
more singular terms,”34 that is, removing the subject from an expression 
such as “— —  is a horse.” Now what makes an expression true? To judge is 
to judge something: as Frege wrote in a footnote, “a judgement, for me, is 
not the mere comprehension of a thought, but the admission of its truth.” 



198 LOGIC AND OBJECT

The admission of a thought’s truth is the reference, as Frege claims that “it 
is the striving for truth that drives us always to advance from the sense to 
the reference. . . . We are therefore driven into accepting the truth- value of 
a sentence as constituting its reference.”35

Sense and Reference on the Web

The same question concerning sense and reference applies to the Web. 
However, our aim is not to solve this problem here but rather to under-
stand it as another order of magnitude, hence to produce a resolution 
or seek a common ground. The logician and computer scientist Patrick 
Hayes and Tim Berners- Lee have debated this issue. For Berners- Lee, a 
URI can refer to anything that he calls a resource; meanwhile, for Hayes, 
for the semantic web or a logical system to exist, there is no immediate 
way of guaranteeing that the URIs pointing to the Tim Berners- Lee of 
thirteen years old and the Tim Berners- Lee of sixty years old are pointing 
to the same person36— two senses (ages) but the same reference (Berners- 
Lee). To resolve this argument, one of the researchers of the semantic 
web, Harry Halpin, proposes to move away from the tradition of Frege 
and Russell to the modal logic of Alfred Tarski, later developed by Saul 
Kripke. Kripke develops powerful resolution of the identity problem by 
introducing the concept of possible worlds. As Kripke defines, “a possible 
world is given by the descriptive conditions we associate with it.”37 For 
Kripke, the proper name is rather a rigid designator (we can also speak 
of weak or loose designators here). A rigid designator is defined by a clus-
ter of descriptions. Here Kripke differs from Frege and Russell and, in so 
doing, critiques both logicians. For Frege and Russell, descriptions are 
synonyms of proper names, whereas for Kripke, a description is only one 
of many that contribute to the rigidity of the designator.

The possible worlds are not only temporal worlds, for example, worlds 
in which Berners- Lee is thirteen years old and sixty years old, respectively. 
We can probably also associate them with what Hilary Putnam calls the 
division of linguistic labors. In his article “The Meaning of ‘Meaning,’ ” 
Putnam developed a critique of logical positivists such as Frege, Russell, 
and Carnap, especially on the point that the “meaning of a term (in the 
sense of intension) determines its extension.”38 In contrast, Putnam shows 
that words such as gold and aluminum have different meanings in differ-
ent sociolinguistic domains. For example, he proposes that we imagine 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 199

that there is a factory in which someone has the job of wearing gold wed-
ding rings, someone has the job of selling gold wedding rings, and some-
one else has the task of determining whether something is gold. Putnam 
shows that we cannot definitely say someone who has the occasion to buy 
gold will be able to tell with reliability whether something is really gold. 
We could say that there are different possible worlds, and the question is 
rather to find an identity that traverses all these worlds. If the proper name 
is not the synonym of its reference, then this signifies that the object is 
no longer its substance nor its states of affairs. In a manner similar to our 
interpretation of Aristotle’s relative in his Categories, Kripke shows that the 
preceding philosophical fallacy must be confronted:

Philosophers have come to the opposite view through a false 
dilemma: they have asked, are these objects behind the bundle of 
qualities, or is the object nothing but the bundle? Neither is the 
case; this table is wooden, brown, in the room, etc. It has all these 
properties and is not a thing without properties behind them; but 
it should not therefore be identified with the set, or “bundle,” of its 
properties, nor with the subset of its essential properties.39

In Halpin’s own treatment, he sympathetically demonstrates that one 
way to resolve the URI identity crisis is to recognize that Tim Berners- Lee 
is actually (and unconsciously) a follower of Kripke,40 because the Web 
allows the existence of possible worlds. I sympathetically endorse this 
analysis, while at the same time, I think that the question stills need to 
be made more precise and that the relational thinking that one can iden-
tify in Kripke’s possible worlds is in this analysis largely missed. What is 
suspicious is the concept of the object raised by Halpin: we can easily de-
termine that a URI doesn’t necessarily indicate a proper name and its ob-
ject; rather, what it indicates is rather arbitrary and can be a predicate, an 
object, a relation. The preceding argument regarding sense and reference 
in terms of the Web takes everything as an object, which we can prob-
ably identify as corresponding to the old analogy between mind and ma-
chine. For example, one can think of anything in one’s mind, and by this 
presentation in thought, it becomes an object. In the case of thinking the 
number 2, the latter becomes an object of thought rather than a concept 
indicating quantities. Halpin’s argument regarding URIs has the tendency 
to equate all relations to proper names. If we say “The city Lüneburg is 



200 LOGIC AND OBJECT

beautiful,” Lüneburg is a proper name, because it is a medieval city that 
has existed in Germany for hundreds of years. In contrast, “is” is not an 
object, and neither is “beautiful.”

It is not the predicates as extensions of the object that give it its iden-
tity, nor does the thing- in- itself define the object as such; the identity 
arises, rather, from a family of descriptions. The URI grasps, but it doesn’t 
grasp the entire object; it doesn’t always grasp a proper name, but it al-
ways grasps relations. A URI deals with objects without differentiating its 
orders of magnitude, and this is why it could plausibly be called a univer-
sal resource indicator (later renamed as a uniform resource indicator). I 
believe there is a new metaphysics to be traced beneath this movement, 
entailing the abolition of all types of objects and their replacement with 
the name “resource,” as the philosopher Alexandre Monnin has wonder-
fully done, though this is not our intention here.41 A URI has intention 
but doesn’t necessarily have intentionality— if we use this word in the 
strict sense of phenomenology. Indeed, I think in this misunderstanding 
of objects— namely, when the URI grasps the object only partially, its 
theorists and technicians take it to have grasped the entire object— we can 
trace a branch of the history of the application of philosophical logic, and 
this may also allow us to construct an alternative reading.

Husserl and the Critique of Logic

If we regard the Web as a technical system of materialized interobjective 
relations that is also constantly materializing new relations, then any inves-
tigation that subsumes itself within the framework of symbolic logic won’t 
be very fruitful beyond contributing to a technical understanding. In this 
section, I would like to reintroduce the thought of Husserl. Husserl’s cri-
tique of logic consists of a critique of symbolic logic that reduces mean-
ing horizons into a short circuit. And the task of Husserl, if we can thus 
simplify it, is to find an embodied way to understand the relation between 
logic and object through a theory of experience. This brings back the no-
tion of intersubjectivity and how it is transformed into interobjectivity 
to produce a new form of intersubjectivity. This shows that another type 
of organization of objects is possible and that it will probably be able to 
reintegrate users into a logical system, in other words, to bring about a 
convergence. The Husserlian logic seems to me to consist of another set 
of relations that gives us a new model for thinking about ontologies, logic, 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 201

and objectivity. By the end, we hope to derive another interpretation of 
intersubjectivity in relation to interobjectivity.

Let’s go back to the question of meaning and concept. When we say 
“Socrates is a man,” the predicate “is a man” must be analytic with regard 
to the concept under which Socrates falls. Where are these meanings com-
ing from? When we say that a sentence is true according to its reference, 
then how can we say that a concept is true? This doesn’t seem to bother 
Frege much:

Just because [grasping and judging] is a mental (seelisches) event, 
we do not have to care about it. It is enough that we can grasp 
thoughts and acknowledge their truth; how this might happen is 
another question.42

Frege further expresses the idea that “we are not owners of thoughts as 
we are owners of ideas. We do not have a thought as we have, say, a sense 
impression, but we also do not see a thought as we see, say, a star.” Thought 
(Gedanke) for Frege is close to Sinn, both of which are idealities that don’t 
appear to us and remain ungraspable. We can probably say that there is 
virtually no experience for Frege that also holds for a computer. The great-
ness of formal logic is that the truth is unconditioned by any interpreta-
tion, but this is also its weakness, in that it is not able to incorporate an 
operational logic. Modal logic à la Alfred Tarski and Saul Kripke has loos-
ened the limits set by Frege and Russell: the possible worlds liberate the 
synonymous relations between a proper name and its references. Now, 
if we turn to Husserl, can one imagine what computer science would be 
if Husserl had been read instead of Frege? Is this a thinkable question? 
Husserl is not a sign that we can substitute in a proposition. If Husserl 
were read instead of Frege, Hilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem would not have 
been posed, and Turing would never have arrived at the universal ma-
chine. Husserl is a world, but not a sign. Similarly, Adam and Eve cannot 
be substituted for Peter and Mary, because Adam and Eve, like Odysseus, 
are rigid designators. Is this a meaningless question? Analytically, there 
is meaning in this sentence, as the question is understandable. But it is 
also meaningless, because such a world is unthinkable if we designate the 
word meaning to refer to something actual or real. What is the meaning 
of a predicate? Where does it come from? In contrast to Frege’s Sinn and 
Bedeutung, Husserl’s phenomenology is nothing less than a project to 



202 LOGIC AND OBJECT

attain the clarity of these relations through the understanding of experi-
ence (Erlebnis), as he stated clearly:

In order for the substrate of the explication to become a subject 
and for the explicates to become predicates, it is necessary that 
the regard turn back to the unity which is passively pre- constituted 
within the receptive activity of the process of explication and is in 
a sense concealed.43

Husserl took up the relation between logic and predication in his Logi-
cal Investigations, and it attained maturity in Experience and Judgement, For-
mal and Transcendental Logic, and The Crisis of European Sciences. Husserl 
proposed in his Logical Investigations to search for a method of pure logic. 
Such a method has two significant criteria for Husserl. The first is anti-
psychologism. On this point, Husserl and Frege are together. Indeed, 
Frege was very critical of Husserl’s first book, The Philosophical Founda-
tion of Arithmetic, and accused him of psychologism. Husserl’s response to 
this criticism is contained in the two volumes of his Logical Investigations. 
Psychologism was a popular approach to logic at the time. Its premise is 
that psychic acts are real events and that the laws of logic reflect the way 
the mind and the human psyche work, hence it “reduces logical laws to 
empirical laws.”44 The problem of psychologism lies in its confusing of the 
real and the ideal. Frege terms this problem epistemological idealism:

Psychological treatments of logic . . . lead(s) then necessarily to 
epistemological idealism. Since all knowledge is judgemental, 
every bridge to the objective is now broken off. This flowing into 
idealism is most remarkable in physiology, because it is in such 
sharp contrast to its realistic starting point.45

Frege’s critique of psychologism is firmly grounded in his belief that logic 
cannot be derived from any individual experience or mental state. Logic 
has to be pure and analytic if it is to be the foundation of thought. What 
is most interesting here is that Husserl on one hand endorsed the fact that 
logic has to be apodeictic (one should recall that Logical Investigations is 
a work undertaken to prepare an “unshakable, absolutely unquestionable 
foundation of knowledge” to defend the certitude of logic against rela-
tivism, skepticism, historicism, and psychologism46— when Husserl was 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 203

writing Logical Investigations, he apparently already had Leibniz’s mathe-
sis universalis in his mind), while, on the other hand, he also advocated 
the fact that logical judgment has to be experiential judgment47 and that 
his philosophy does not advocate an “objective philosophy” but a tran-
scendental philosophy. An immediate question is, how can experiential 
judgments guarantee an objective truth at all? We can say that Husserl 
dedicated his whole career to searching for an answer to this question— to 
seeking for a way to make transcendental philosophy the foundation of 
a rigorous science able to overcome the crisis of the European sciences. 
We have to admit that there are different Husserls, and the late Husserl is 
quite different from the early Husserl. For example, in Crisis of European 
Sciences, we find Husserl continuing to engage in a critique of the mod-
ern appropriation of mathesis universalis, as he has already outlined in his 
programmatic of Formal and Transcendental Logic (see chapter 2). But this 
notion of transcendental philosophy had been already significant in the 
second volume of Logical Investigations.

We have to clarify the term transcendental here. Transcendental philoso-
phy is a term generally associated with Kantian doctrine. For Kant, tran-
scendental means a priori but retrievable, for example, the knowledge that 
4 + 4 = 8 is a priori, because it is not an empirical creation. Kant finds the 
foundation of knowledge to be the pure, the a priori. Husserl criticized 
Kant’s inability to develop a truly transcendental philosophy owing to his 
uncritical attitude toward the a priori. For Husserl, Kant only goes halfway 
and is actually “far away from accomplishing a truly radical grounding of 
philosophy.”48 Husserl is thus distant from the brand of neo- Kantianism 
that seeks the foundation of science in Kant’s philosophy. Husserl wants 
to go further and do what Kant did not and could not do by grounding 
knowledge in a truly transcendental philosophy. For him, transcendental 
philosophy is the

motif of inquiring back into the ultimate source of all the forma-
tions of knowledge, the motif of the knower’s reflecting upon 
himself and his knowing life which all the scientific structures that 
are valid for him own purposefully are stored up as acquisitions 
and have become and continue to become freely available.49

This only adds more confusion to our understanding of logic. How can logic 
arise from the subject without being subjective? We can see that for Frege 



204 LOGIC AND OBJECT

and other logicians, there is a move from the subjective to the objective, 
whereas for Husserl, the objective is to be found in the subjective. That 
this puts him at odds with his contemporary logicians is clearly stated in 
Experience and Judgement, where Husserl says that if the logicians really 
aim at logic, they shouldn’t simply play with the rules of the game, but 
should “direct [themselves] towards the laws of formation of judgement”; 
otherwise, they merely comprise “the merely negative conditions of the 
possibility of truth.”50 This critique resonates with Husserl’s critique of 
Galilean geometry, which indicates the beginning of the crisis of European 
sciences. Geometry for Husserl originated from the measurement of land 
and rivers in ancient times. Measurements imply an intuitive experience 
of the world. Modern geometry becomes practical geometry in the sense 
that all knowledge is subsumed under calculation and abstraction without 
experience. In 1898, Hilbert gave a lecture in Göttingen titled “Elements 
of Euclidean Geometry”; this was never intended to be a course on ge-
ometry, however, and what Hilbert wanted to do was show that “it must 
be shown by pure logic that the theorems follow from the axioms without 
the corrupting influence of what we can ‘see’ by looking at a diagram.”51 
The reduction of experience to abstract knowledge implies progress to-
ward a naive realism. It is true that pupils in school are told that the ori-
gin of geometry was measurement, but this mere historical knowledge 
doesn’t reopen the realm of its originary experience. This reduction is not 
only the reduction of primitive knowledge to a highly abstracted realm 
but also the modification of the structure of meanings, which cannot 
alone restore the development of scientific knowledge. Husserl’s thesis 
“The Origin of Geometry” sets itself the task of restoring such a mean-
ing. Now that the doubt about logic is the same as the crisis of the spirit 
of European sciences, the opposition is between one kind of truth that 
is guaranteed by axioms and another made possible through experience.

For logicians, the predication of the object has to guarantee two crite-
ria: one is the truth value of the propositions (truth in itself), the other that 
the truth has to be independent of experience (truth for itself). Husserl’s 
phenomenological approach is critical of this dogmatism. To transcend 
the limits set by logic, Husserl has to overcome these two criteria while 
preserving the idea of truth. Understanding Husserl’s method is impor-
tant for speculating on the relation between computation and experience. 
For Husserl, the intimacy between the human and technics is maintained 
by unfolding experience, which also conditions a true foundation for sci-



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 205

ence. The immediate response will be, isn’t computation itself experien-
tial? The users interact with software, video games, and so on, which elicit 
experiences and excitement. We are not denying this fact. When Husserl 
was lamenting that arithmetical thinking becomes “free, systematic, a pri-
ori” and “completely liberated from all intuited actuality, about numbers, 
numerical relations, numerical laws,”52 he didn’t mean that arithmeticians 
calculate mechanically, because they still have to think creatively to solve 
problems and make great discoveries, but rather that “they have acquired, 
unnoticed, a displaced meaning.”53

Knowledge systems, in this case geometry or logic, become more and 
more rule based. In the context of a technical system, it is rather objects— 
technical objects, then digital objects— that become rule imposing. Cer-
tain systems tend to create short circuits of meanings that render engage-
ments with technical objects superficial (e.g., simply pressing a button 
to start and stop an engine, repeating the same gestures on an assembly 
line). To restore the foundation of knowledge, knowledge cannot be con-
ceived in purely abstract forms, such as represented by detached symbols, 
but must be founded in humans’ “kinestheses,” that is, the movements of 
the living body. It is the same for our case: digital objects don’t obliterate 
experience, but they do modify meanings, and the question is not really 
what is modified and what is not but rather, will we be able to create a new 
condition of involvement to reactivate abstract knowledge? If Husserl’s 
task is to unfold concrete and abstract knowledge through his phenom-
enological approach, it will also be useful for our investigation into digital 
objects and the conceptualization of a transductive logic.

Intentional Act and Transcendental Logic

How can we find a ground for eidetic knowledge while remaining tran-
scendental? Husserl retreats to Descartes’s formulation of the ego in his 
Cartesian Meditations. For Descartes, the ego serves as the foundation of 
certitude and begins from the formulation “I think therefore I am.” This 
corresponds to what Husserl calls a phenomenological epoché, a bracketing 
of the world by suspending all presuppositions and idealities. The epoché 
distances the human from his naive attitude to the world and places him 
in a position that enables him to reconstitute the world and hence truth. 
Now, what the ego is experiencing are not the “real objects” with which we 
deal in the world but rather a flux of consciousness, which has to be reified 



206 LOGIC AND OBJECT

or objectified through the intentional acts of the ego, that is, cogitationes. 
The flux of consciousness is thus the “honest description of the unadulter-
ated data of experience” disclosed as the cogito.54 In Descartes, Husserl 
also identifies his concept of intentionality as the act of the ego:

Intentionality is either itself an awareness of evidence— a charac-
teristic of the cogitatum itself— or it is applied and directed (es-
sentially and in the manner of a horizon) to “authentic givenness” 
(Selbstgebung).55

The task of Husserl is exactly to develop a theory that is able to unveil the 
structure of intentionality and the possibility of an apodictic science. For 
the purpose of our investigation, we would say that such a theory discloses 
the meaning structure of a predicative judgment. For Husserl, there are 
two levels of objectifying operations, the first of which is receptive experi-
ence, the second being predicative spontaneity.56 Receptive experience is 
the experience by which the objects give themselves directly to us. The 
objects give themselves in our consciousness as hyletic and morphic data 
and constitute our pre- predicative experience. The expression of the ob-
ject and the categorial intuition of the ego upon perceiving it result in a 
categorial form. In the discussion of context in Part II, we used the exam-
ple of a man going home and seeing something in the corner of his room 
that looks like a snake. The setting given to the man constitutes for him 
a situation of suspicion that is an example of the pre- predicative experi-
ence. Now he will have to scrutinize the object to determine whether it 
is a rope or a snake, but subsequently he finds that it is only a rope. We 
should note that there is a process of negation here, as the anticipation 
of a snake is negated by the investigations the man carries out. Here we 
find that negation is not simply a singular predicative judgment but rather 
takes its original form in the pre- predicative sphere of receptive experi-
ence. This means that meaning is fulfilled in the intentional act; hence a 
judgment for Husserl is fundamentally a fulfilment of meaning. A ques-
tion arises immediately: how is this related to a proposition (e.g., “A is not 
B”)? Husserl correlates the judgment of truth (the proposition) with the 
judgment of existence (the meaning). For a computer, the judgment of 
a proposition is nothing but the technicization of knowledge, whereas 
for a human being, the logical operation has to be based on experience 
itself. This is precisely the motivation of transcendental phenomenology. 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 207

Husserl’s phenomenological method has no place in a machine, and that 
is also why the formal ontologists find only the arithmetician Husserl im-
portant and not the phenomenologist Husserl. In any sense, phenomenol-
ogy is a method that suspends the natural attitude and unfolds the struc-
ture of meaning in everyday activities. Addressing the correlation between 
the proposition and the experience is for Husserl the true investigation 
of knowledge. We may then want to ask, what is the difference between 
transcendental philosophy and psychologism or even descriptive psychol-
ogy? Didn’t Husserl himself propose a cognitive process as the foundation 
of the laws of logic? In Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology, Husserl 
admitted the difficulty of resolving the relation between phenomenology 
and psychology:

In fact, it is (if I may be allowed a judgement from my own experi-
ence) a long and thorny way starting from purely logical insights, 
from insights pertaining to the theory of signification, from onto-
logical and noetical insights, likewise from the customary norma-
tive and psychological theory of knowledge, to arrive at seizing 
upon, in a genuine sense, the immanent- psychological and then 
phenomenological data, and finally to arrive at all at the concatena-
tions of essence which make the transcendental relations intel-
ligible a priori.57

We see from this confession that Husserl was struggling from the time of 
his psychological approach in the Philosophy of Arithmetic, to the psycho-
logical theory of knowledge in Cartesian Meditations, and finally to a truly 
phenomenological method in his late works. Husserl is sympathetic to 
psychology.58 It is not surprising that phenomenology has its roots in psy-
chology, though it has surpassed psychology to bring forth pure logic. The 
difference between them is also an important question for us, because our 
concern is to show not only how it is possible to arrive at the apodictic un-
derstanding of objects but also the different levels of meaning structures. 
Psychology has been widely employed in interface and system design by 
investigating the psychical activity of users. But we don’t really have a phe-
nomenological approach to computation, unless we take formal ontol-
ogy further. Husserl’s critique of psychology is rather complicated, hence 
I simplify to highlight two main points. First, psychology is inherent to 
the Cartesian dualism, and this stops it from becoming the foundation of 



208 LOGIC AND OBJECT

science. Second, psychology as the science of internal experience has an 
affinity with phenomenological– psychological deduction (the first de-
duction), but it never reaches the phenomenological– transcendental de-
duction (second deduction), and it is only in the second deduction that 
philosophers are able to arrive at a transcendental ego.

To clarify the first point, we have to develop Husserl’s critique of 
Descartes. The question is, why was Descartes not able to develop a true 
transcendental philosophy after discovering the certitude of the ego and 
descriptive psychology? Husserl believes that at the same time Descartes 
made a serious mistake, because he also excluded the body as res extensa. 
The ego is now pure soul, having gotten rid of the body. Descartes believed 
that this soul has a substrate such as the physical body. The problem is that, 
on this basis, Descartes was not able to carry the epoché to its most radical 
form and regressed back to the pure soul. Underlying the Cartesian regres-
sion is a double movement toward objectivity following on from Galileon 
geometricization. First, Descartes wants to infer an objective outer world 
from the inner soul; second, he wants to develop an objective science of 
the soul, which is to say, a psychology. In Husserl’s own words, the ego- 
logical immanence is substituted by psychological immanence. The pure 
soul is the residuum of the abstraction of the physical body, but without 
submitting the self to that of a phenomenon:

The whole gain, the great discovery of this ego, loses its values 
through an absurd misconstitution: a pure soul has no meaning 
at all in the epoché, unless it is a “soul” in “bracket,” i.e., as mere 
“phenomenon” no less than the living body.59

We should pay special attention to two terms here: phenomenon and liv-
ing body. Descartes put himself in a paradoxical situation, because his ap-
proach necessitated that the soul infer the world. He could not solve this 
problem without sheltering in the concept of God, that is to say, God’s 
benevolence acts as the bridge between the ego and the world. This, to 
Husserl, is absurd. The epoché is supposed to reduce the world, includ-
ing the self, to a phenomenon and allow the phenomenon to be self- 
evidential; this is also what is indicated in the phrase “back to the things 
themselves.” Through the bracketing, the ego will be able to see the phe-
nomenon without presuppositions. Moreover, a living body (Leib) is not a 
physical body (Körper). The physical body is purely physiological, but the 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 209

living body is the only body given to me in reception and that “acquires 
the ontic validity of the physical body.”60 The living body is Husserl’s key 
for overcoming the dualism, and indeed, the ego can only know the world 
through the living body, a concept of the life- world (Lebenswelt) to which 
we will return.

Sinn, Bedeutung, and Meaning Horizons

The preceding sections attempted to show that formal logical thinking 
concerning the Web is inadequate by looking into the formal relation be-
tween logic and object. The discussion of Husserl raised another theoreti-
cal understanding of the relation between logic and object. Frege’s logic 
was referred to as extensional logic and Husserl’s as intentional logic. 
For Frege, truth doesn’t depend on the sense (Sinn) but on the refer-
ence (Bedeutung). Philosophers try to identify Frege’s Sinn with Husserl’s 
meaning and his Bedeutung with Husserl’s objects.61 It is not our intention 
to engage in a historical study of the debate here, but we assert that such 
an identification ignores the fact that meaning in Husserl’s sense is con-
tinuous, motivated, and based on experience, while meaning for Frege 
is always discrete and abstract. In other words, meaning for Husserl is a 
capturing process, whereas for Frege it is an axiom: Husserl’s meaning as 
an evolving manifold may be corrected, whereas an axiom cannot be cor-
rected (because if it can be determined to be wrong, it cannot be consid-
ered an axiom). For Husserl, a round square bears meaning, but for Frege, 
it is absurd. In volume 2 of Logical Investigations, Husserl directly spoke 
against the Fregean distinction:

“Meaning” [Bedeutung] is further used by us as synonymous with 
“sense” [Sinn]. It is agreeable to have parallel, interchangeable terms 
in the case of this concept, particularly since the sense [Sinn] of the 
term “meaning” [Bedeutung] is itself to be investigated. A further 
consideration is our ingrained tendency to use the two words as 
synonymous, a circumstance which makes it seem rather a dubi-
ous step if their meanings are differentiated, and if (as G. Frege has 
proposed) we use one for meaning in our sense, and the other for 
objects expressed [ für die ausgedrückten Gegenstände]. To this we 
may add that both terms are exposed to the same equivocations 
[Äquivokationen], which we distinguished above in connection 



210 LOGIC AND OBJECT

with the term “expression” [bei der Rede vom Ausgedrücktsein], and 
to many more besides, and that this is so in both scientific and in 
ordinary speech.62

Husserl was aware of the distinction between the object and meaning in 
Frege, but he decided to ignore it. His refusal to accept Frege’s criticism 
is based on the view that Frege is not able to recognize that objectivity is 
not the object out there but rather the meaning structure that correlates to 
the object. Objectivity is thus not the object as a mere thing out there but 
the object’s relation to the life- world through my living body (Leib) and 
phenomenological reflection.63 So we need another idea of objectivity, an 
objectivity that is eidetic but nevertheless subjective:

each of us has his own experiential representations but with the 
normal certainty that everyone present experiences the same 
things and in the possible course of his experiences can come 
to know the same things through similar properties.64

Is this naive? For many logicians, the late Husserlian theory of logic went 
astray. For example, in the preceding quotation, the phrase “normal cer-
tainty” holds no validity in formal logic. There is either certainty or non-
certainty but not “in most cases certain.” But Husserl also rendered abso-
lute objectivity into an ideality situated within the subject’s life- world. This 
ideality should aim to be unconditionally valid for all subjects, “beginning 
with that on which normal Europeans, normal Hindus, Chinese, etc, agree 
in spite of all relativity- beginning.”65 Now Husserl finds the ideality neither 
in the object nor in individual mediation but in human communication. 
Communication or intersubjective understanding constitutes objectivity 
by acting as the indicator or timer of the transcendental deduction:

idealizing thinking conquers the infinity of the experiential world 
as a world knowledge to be attained idealiter through the thought 
and conceivably through continuation and infinite perfection of 
external experience, knowledge based on a conceivable renewal 
“again and again” of the enrichment of experience.66

What, then, is this idealizing if it is not internalized by communication 
and agreement? The simplest way to achieve this ideality is to develop a 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 211

standard ontology for everything through writing. If this ontology is used 
as the basis for understanding, then objectivity is already established. This 
is the case not only for geometrical objects, for example, rectangles, but 
also for cultural objects. In Experience and Judgement, Husserl speaks of 
free and bounded ideality. A rectangle is a free ideality that remains the 
same everywhere, but a bounded ideality like a cultural object is bound to 
a spatiotemporal setting. The ideality of geometry is not created through 
communication but is rather preserved through it. For Husserl, the ques-
tions are, first, how this ideality is derived (whereby no matter how many 
times it is repeated, it produces the same objective sense) and, second, 
how these idealities can be reused without leading to an automation that 
eliminates experience. Hence it is clear here that Husserl gives priority to 
cognition over communication.

Object and Imagination

It is worth distinguishing our conceptualization of the technical system 
here from that of Niklas Luhmann’s systems theory, so as to distinguish 
from a technocratic system of communication. Luhmann’s systems theory 
takes a similar approach to Husserlian phenomenology. For his social sys-
tem, the most important concept is meaning, and when he talks about 
communication, he refers specifically to Husserl’s meaning and cognition, 
though still maintaining a distinction between the meaning of cognition 
and the meaning of communication.67 Luhmann takes Husserl’s analysis 
of intentionality into his analysis of communication, translating the phe-
nomenological reduction into the “reduction of complexity.”68 Then he 
goes beyond intersubjectivity in developing his systems theory. In our 
discussion of the digital as a technical system that co- constitutes human 
and computing tools, digital objects act both as objects of cognition and as 
objects of communication and allow us a new interpretation of objectivity 
and possible worlds. For Husserl, the meaning of communication is in-
dispensable from the meaning of cognition. We go further into the ques-
tion of cognition in chapter 6.

In his Crisis of European Sciences and essays such as “The Origin of Ge-
ometry,” Husserl further proposes that communication serves cognition. 
For to preserve the eidetic truth of geometry, we have to keep communi-
cating its original meaning from generation to generation. So the object of 
recognition is not ahistorical but belongs to the life- world. But how can 



212 LOGIC AND OBJECT

we know the origin of geometry, and in what sense can we experience its 
origin if we are only speculating about its origin from historical fragments? 
To consider a mathematical theory, for example, the Turing machine, as 
a collection of axioms arranged through an algorithm, which ensures the 
validity of each operation (e.g., writing in the squares on the paper tape), it 
always goes from a basic axiom to a wider range of axioms. Isn’t this basic 
axiom the origin? But Husserl’s origin doesn’t mean anything like this, 
because origin for him must be experiential and intuitive:

original self- evidence must not be confused with the self- evidence 
of “axioms”; for “axioms” are in principle already the results of original 
meaning- construction and always have this behind them.69

The axiom already has a well- established meaning structure, and it can be 
adopted dogmatically without being experienced. Now the original mean-
ing remains a question for scientific investigation. How can we grasp the 
origin of geometry when we have already been told from time to time that 
it originated from land and river measurements? Husserl’s solution is to 
look at the present, or at what he calls the “historically primary in itself.”70 
The present is also the life- world. Husserl proposes his phenomenological 
method as holding the possibility of arriving at a historical certainty:

Through what method do we obtain a universal and also fixed a 
priori of the historical world which is always originally genuine? 
Whenever we consider it, we find ourselves with the self- evident 
capacity to reflect— to turn to the horizon and to penetrate it in 
an expository way. But we also have, and know that we have, the 
capacity of complete freedom to transform, in thought and phantasy, 
our human historical existence and what is there exposed as its life- 
world. And precisely in this activity of free variation, and in running 
through the conceivable possibilities for the life- world, there arises, 
with apodictic self- evidence, an essentially general set of elements 
going through all the variants; and of this we can convince our-
selves with truly apodictic certainty.71

The origin is imagined from the fragments of history that are present to it! 
Then isn’t this origin in itself arbitrary, because it exists only in fantasy and 
imagination? How can the apodictic certainty be mediated? The only way 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 213

for Husserl is through the phenomenological reduction. Only through the 
epoché is one able to trace the complexity of the noesis– noema correlation 
and to arrive at an apodictic understanding. This doesn’t involve a simplifi-
cation but a clarification.72 We have to say that Husserl never makes it clear 
how this can be done exactly. Indeed, he sometimes ignores that which is 
contradictory in his thought, for example, the fact that horizon is always 
associated with something else in the life- world, so that the identity of an 
object cannot be completed at certain points but rather its relations ex-
tend into infinity.

The constitution of objects is no longer a form- imposition but rather 
unified relations from the subject of consciousness. This brings us back to 
the comparison of Husserl and Simondon that Deleuze has made and that 
we mentioned earlier, that is to say, protogeometry and modulation by in-
tensity. To be is to be bounded by intensity.73 There remains a question 
to be resolved in the following sections, namely, how to mediate between 
the act of ideation bounded by the meaning horizon and the act of ideal-
ization through exteriorization. At this moment, we have arrived at, after 
a long exposition of the question of logic and object in analytic philoso-
phy and in phenomenology, developing certain compatibilities between 
Husserl and Kripke and Putnam. One may ask, isn’t this the opposite to 
what we have discussed previously concerning relations and interobjec-
tivity as opposed to intersubjectivity? Such would be the case if we were 
to attribute the concept of object merely to a subject, that is to say, to see 
the object as constituted purely by noema corresponding to noesis. For ex-
ample, when we look at a stone and turn it into an object of consciousness, 
we may have different meaning horizons for the object before us. These 
horizons may converge or overlap in certain ways that give us a common 
identity of the stone. This common identity is achieved through different 
levels of categorization, as Simondon explained in Imagination et invention 
in terms of biological, mental, and symbolic registers. Conversely, we can 
also consider these different orders as possible worlds (or realities): the 
perception of a stone as such allows us to say that we have seen a stone as 
such, so an identity is formed across the first order of the possible worlds. 
Yet when it comes to symbols and images, a sociolinguistic division of 
labor is required such that an identity may not be given without commu-
nication: it is both intersubjective and interobjective.

A digital image wrapped in metadata allows both human and ma-
chine to recognize that it is an image of a certain thing. This recognition 



214 LOGIC AND OBJECT

is limited to certain lower orders of magnitude, for example, biological 
for humans and logical for machines. Both inductive logic and deductive 
logic operate on levels of consistency to preserve the truth condition of 
their systems. The abductive logic developed by Charles Sanders Peirce 
(1839– 1914) comes from pragmatic consideration: it is a guess that tries to 
give us the best explanation from observations. It often gives us sufficient 
causes instead of necessary causes, like Kripke’s possible worlds explana-
tion. In contrast, a transductive logic is less about explanation and more 
about transformation. In this transformation, the coherence of different 
orders of magnitude is preserved, but the structure of the system has also 
changed. Transduction comes out of an energetic field, which Simondon 
calls the ground: “the ground is what conceals the dynamics; it is what 
makes the system of forms exist. The forms do not participate in forms, 
but in the ground, which is the system of all the forms . . . the ground is the 
system of virtuality, of potentials, of forces.”74 In our context, this ground, 
it seems to me, resonates with Husserl’s life- world, and information or in-
tensity with meaning.

Life- World and Crystallization of Categorial Forms

The life- world, as Husserl puts it is “the forgotten meaning foundation of 
natural science.”75 The life- world is opposite to the technicization (Tech-
nisierung) and formalization of knowledge. The life- world is the ground 
of all forms. For example, let’s consider an unicorn. How can a unicorn, a 
nonexistent object, bear any meaning at all without a life- world? The inter-
nal horizon cannot be actualized in the imaginary process of the unicorn 
but has to be directed to the external horizon, for example, the memory 
of a unicorn, the myth concerning the unicorn. The motivation process 
of the horizon is not linear; it anticipates, negates, remembers, and so 
on. This exposition hopes to bring us back to a reflection on objectivity 
and meaning. The critique of logic in the thought of philosophers such as 
Kripke and Putnam amounts to an effort to extend a logical system into 
a broader and flexible model that captures meanings, instead of being re-
stricted to the synonymous relation between names and references. We 
should then radicalize such an imperative in the development of the logi-
cal language of the Web. If printing is a technics that brings objects into 
circulation and communicates the original experience of geometry to the 
subsequent generations, then the new writing that we can find in digital 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 215

objects allows us to reconstitute a new hermeneutics with finer divisions; 
history is turned into records, taking on, as we have discussed, a topologi-
cal temporality— though the term topological is no longer a metaphor but 
indicates something mathematical and calculable. This shift in hermeneu-
tic model reduces the implicit mediations that traverse time and space and 
that bring humans together explicitly.

This explicitness brings objects and human beings closer; it also brings 
meditative meanings to lower levels, which allows automation to be domi-
nant. For Simondon, automation is the lowest level of perfection of ma-
chines (we understand here that by automation, he refers to the simple 
repetitive operation of machines); in contrast, automation must be prob-
lematized and the human must be reintegrated into the technical system. It 
seems to me that Simondon’s seeking to restore human beings as technical 
individuals (in which the human is able to create an associated milieu of 
its own) is similar to Husserl’s agenda to retrieve experience from abstract 
symbols and rules. Husserl’s phenomenological method has been little 
used in the construction of web ontologies, because most of the ontolo-
gies we use today are merely inductions from the empirical experiences 
of engineers; however, Husserl’s phenomenology seems to me valuable in 
its problematization of pairs such as logic– automation and ontologies– 
meaning horizons. The Husserlian method remains a useful motif for us to 
think about digital objects.

One polemic example that is in line with this Husserlian– Simondonian 
critique is collaborative annotation or, more in its most primitive form, 
tagging. Tagging has often been considered opposed to ontologies, espe-
cially in provocations by some popular writers such as Clay Shirky.76 We 
will have to distinguish ourselves from Shirky’s position because it is too 
easy, and ultimately unhelpful, to claim that ontology is overrated. For in 
the end, ontologies are necessary, ontologies are productive and can stra-
tegically serve as “shortcuts.” First, tagging is an organization of relations 
that destabilizes the conception of objectivity and monolithic meanings. 
Tags are expressions of different individuals, forms coming out of the life- 
world of each individual. Second, while tagging may be the most intuitive 
form of arriving at objectivity, it is still one that is immature; furthermore, 
we can think of other models of tagging (with a variety of predicates, 
such as is, has, is_part_of ), such as those used in formal ontology, as well 
as other types of contributive ways of understanding objects, such as 
through the invention of new vocabularies, as in Heidegger. Tagging alone 



216 LOGIC AND OBJECT

is not sufficient, and indeed it needs many other constraints, for example, 
to limit the number of tags to ensure that they are well chosen.77 But at its 
minimum, tagging serves as an example of how different possible worlds 
may be brought together. Here we can refer to the possible worlds and 
meaning horizons of different actors. If we consider the name– reference 
relationship as an effect of a family of relations and descriptions, then tag-
ging on a digital object brings these different description systems together, 
including those that are mutually contradictory: ugly and beautiful can 
come together— this would probably be a better example of Kripke’s pos-
sible worlds, because there is a reality where an object is at the same time 
beautiful and ugly. On the side of the individual users, tagging puts the 
users in the particular situation of being able to make judgments, instead 
of limiting them to reading by pressing a few simple buttons. It opens a 
new process of collective ideation toward idealization in both objective 
and material senses. Now to judge is not to give a predicate to the object, 
but rather it involves a retrieval of the life- world, a reactivation of the ex-
perience of others and their intuition toward objects. These intentional re-
trievals are then turned into URIs or other forms of material relations and 
cluster with other relations.

The digital object with user- generated tags becomes a special cultural 
object consisting of different intentionalities represented as traces of inter-
actions and retrievals; it doesn’t just present itself as an object that belongs 
to a specific culture but also as the constitution of the We against the so-
lipsistic contemplation of the world. I am tempted to think of the initia-
tive of tagging as a possibility of developing a Husserlian critique of the 
Web— a standardization of categories that traverses all cultures through 
the Web— as well as to locate in it the possibility of further developing 
a transductive logic corresponding to Simondon’s thinking. Tagging or 
other contributive forms of annotation should be considered methodolo-
gies that add a new term beyond implicit and explicit, just as transduction 
serves as a third term in addition to induction and deduction. We may call 
this third term “complicity.” The word complicit, according to the Oxford 
English Dictionary, comes from the French word complicité, which has 
two meanings. The first is “mutual understanding,” for example, as when 
two people look at each other and laugh at the same time without further 
communication; the second meaning is “participation in delinquency.” 
Complicit is neither explicit, because the compound descriptions cannot 
be reduced to truth statements, nor implicit, because it is already stated 



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 217

as such; at the same time, it problematizes and destabilizes the present 
status as delinquencies. I understand this as tension in Simondon’s concept 
of individuation and Husserl’s doubt– explication pair in the formation of 
meaning horizons. The stabilization of the meaning horizon could be per-
ceived as the crystallization of tags through secondary treatment, for ex-
ample, the creation of TagCloud, which is a selection tool showing which 
tags are used more often and hence are possibly more mature than others.

The phenomenological method has reactivated the observer’s experi-
ence of objects by suspending his or her usual perceptions and makes sci-
ence concrete rather than merely abstract. Husserl’s critique in “The Origin 
of Geometry,” as we have seen, is precisely intended to achieve this aim, to 
undo the naivety of the natural attitude in our everyday life. To reawaken 
the experience is to restore the life- world back to its technicization. Phe-
nomenological methods have to be called upon again and again to negate 
this attitude. If tagging is a process of reduction, it may present us with 
the possibility of bringing forward a long circuit of experience. The experi-
ence awakened must be something against the automation of knowledge, 
and indeed, because we are now in a technical system, we can always use 
the “adding up” to create new possibilities, for example, through a differ-
ent algorithm and data structure design. But these questions have to be 
understood not as something addressed merely for the sake of efficiency 
and real time. We are not against real time in terms of the response of the 
computer but rather against the mode of interaction that reduces users to 
passive subjects who bypass expression to go straight to indications.

From Interobjectivity to Intersubjectivity and Back

As we have seen, for Husserl, cultural objects presuppose the a priori struc-
ture of intersubjectivity, which is revealed in objects as traces of the living 
body. Husserl turned to Leibniz’s monadology for his theory of inter-
subjectivity in which egos are like monads: they have their closed worlds, 
but they can sense others without material connections. We may ask, if an 
ego only has one world, how many possible worlds does an object have? 
Heidegger said that a stone doesn’t have a world. We disagreed with this 
in that a stone’s world is relational just as much as a human being’s, for 
without the stone, the ants wouldn’t be able to find a good location for 
their dwellings, just as an old lady wouldn’t be able to find a place to sit 
down after the pilgrimage to a temple. If we read it from the perspective 



218 LOGIC AND OBJECT

of the Husserlian distinction, passivity and activity belong to human be-
ings only, and so objects like stones are signs that only present them with 
a passive synthesis: they are things to sit down on, to be thrown away, to 
be kicked, or to remind us of something or somebody. When Schutz fol-
lowed Husserl’s intersubjectivity and compared a stone and a person, he 
said, “If I see a stone within my reach, I simply see it, and that is the end of 
the matter. If I see an Other person in my reach, I necessarily discover that, 
inversely, I am also in his reach: he sees me.”78 With a natural object, the 
passivity of synthesis posits the object within the subject’s isolated cogni-
tion: one tree out of thousands of trees in the Black Forest, one stone out 
of thousands on the beach. But another person displaces the “I” out of its 
solipsism to recognize the “we.” Here we will have to clarify an ambiguous 
question: what is the position of the “we” in the phenomenological reduc-
tion? The phenomenological reduction is not a separation from the world 
but is the method we can perform to scrutinize the granularity of noetic 
acts. The person who performs the noetic act is still in the world with oth-
ers, only in the transcendental reduction, these relations come into clarity. 
Tagging or contributive annotation, which we understand as a constant 
reduction, reveals to us the complexity of noetic acts and noematic con-
tents in their actualization. Husserl applies this understanding to all cul-
tural objects:

This applies furthermore also to all human products in visible 
reality. As products of the animated Body, they are animated just 
as any thingly process produced, stimulated, or elicited by human 
agency: a stroke that is aimed, a stick wielded, a book written, etc., 
take on the spirituality of the Body. The movement of a machine 
has its spirituality just as the machine itself has. Each work, each 
product, each action expresses an activity and is characterized as 
work, as act: one sees how the cigar is rolled, one discovers therein 
the expression of a manipulation and, on the other hand, the “vis-
ible” aim. The handwriting, each stroke in it, its “ductus,” bears 
the stamp of the objective spirit. In short, products and works are 
again psycho- physical unities; they have their physical and their 
spiritual aspects, they are physical things that are “animated.”79

Husserl was here trying to unfold the meaning structure of cultural ob-
jects. Cultural objects always embed a meaning structure that doesn’t ex-



 LOGIC AND OBJECT 219

haust itself in the eidos. Each work presents us with a process of its mak-
ing and expresses something more associative than what is directly given. 
Husserl calls the appearance and the expression beyond the appearance 
“psycho- physical unities.” Cultural objects have their world because it is 
not a passive spontaneity, but a unity of retentions, that provides an infi-
nite source for the horizon. In tagging, when we say that object A reminds 
us of something, this is an association based on its appearance. Now we 
want to ask, do digital objects have a world? There is not just one world 
but many possible worlds. These worlds are not isolated like the monads 
that contain other worlds internally and implicitly but are rather open to 
one other and unified in digital objects through interobjective relations. 
The digital object opens up worlds, unifies them, and discloses to the 
users of the other possible worlds that objects are not passive syntheses 
but refer you to somewhere else, out of anticipation; this is usually called 
serendipity.

The possible worlds of the object disclose to us different meaning struc-
tures, that is, Others. Intersubjectivity has taken shape through the materi-
alization and (materialized) organization of interobjectivity. The intensifica-
tion of intersubjectivity can be effected through creating new interobjective 
relations in the technical system. The formation of interobjectivity, con-
versely, conditions the “We,” which is itself not possible without experi-
ence, that is, without experiencing each other. If our hypothesis is reason-
able, the way we interact with objects and enter into communication with 
them constitutes the “we” in the digital milieu. There is a passing over 
from the meaning of the cognitive to the meaning of the “we.” This ques-
tion has never been asked in formal logic, because it only addresses part of 
the system of interobjective relations. In the later stage of his life, Husserl 
revised his psychological tendency. In his first book on Arithmetic, he was 
comfortable about including psychology as the first step toward knowl-
edge. The psychical entities revealed by the object demand another pro-
cess of phenomenological reduction to appropriate the psychical as some-
thing rational, which we see now is a form of writing presenting itself as a 
metastable status of meaning horizons. Contributive annotation as a new 
form of logical writing further intensifies the “we.” The technology of the 
“we” is an indispensable part of the objectivity founded on the subjective 
and the long circuit that reawakens our experience of the objects. Indeed, 
Husserl was right to say that “every spontaneity sinks down into passiv-
ity.”80 Like geometry, experience can dissolve materialization into signs, 



220 LOGIC AND OBJECT

writings, and technical objects; the origin from then on remains invisible 
and is slowly replaced by a system of signs such as formal logic. Then, as 
we have seen, the reconstruction of the origin of geometry has to be based 
on the imagination of the present through the reactivation of technics of 
communication. That is to say, it has to change the relations sedimented 
in the technical system.

The comparison here between the Fregean tradition and the Husserlian 
phenomenological approach to logic aims to illustrate the nature of digital 
objects in their logical foundation, which is also the mathematical founda-
tion of computation. It also wants to expose the limits of its understanding 
of objects by reintroducing phenomenology and, ultimately, to reconcile 
Simondon and Husserl. Engineers tend to accept this foundation of logic, 
because everything is already established: a well- defined system is already 
in front of us. But a hundred years ago, there were still doubts and suspi-
cions. Today Husserl’s challenge has become totally unheard in the study 
of computer science (except for parts of Husserl’s Logical Investigations). 
We should be aware that the semantic web, including its architecture and 
the standards that it enforces, is only one way to organize digital objects: 
there are other organizations that we can imagine even within the techni-
cal system that we are in. But this also shows how far standardization is 
from the reach of ordinary users or researchers who could have provided new 
perspectives. This chapter has contrasted extensional logic and intentional 
logic and showed how such an historical account can be beneficially used 
to reflect on convergence and the internal transformation of the techni-
cal system. It has ended with suggesting that contributive annotation 
may be an example of the realization of what Husserl would call meaning 
horizons— an organization of relations (other than by formal logic) that 
is both collective and individual. It is also a process of collective deduc-
tion of relations, in which we can observe a transductive effect on both the 
technical system and the users. Tagging could probably have been imple-
mented without the guidance of Husserl, but what our hindsight shows is 
that philosophy can push this polemic in a more rigorous way, to modify 
an intersubjective system as suggested by Simondon. Seeking for a Web 
that goes beyond the Web of automation is a question of searching for dif-
ferent logics able to give us a new form of perfection and organization of 
digital objects.

· CHAPTER 6 ·

Logic and Time

In chapter 5, we approached the question of convergence from the starting point of Husserl’s intentional logic and formal logic (consid-
ered as two orders) in our search for a transductive logic. In this chapter, 
I want to move from the digital object to its milieu by showing that digi-
tal objects partially constitute what I call tertiary protention. Considering 
tertiary protention leads us into an inquiry into another order of experi-
ence that is different from the experience of the meaning horizon that 
we discussed in chapter 5 but that is fundamentally temporal and meta-
physical. The aim of this chapter is to suggest that we should move from 
the notion of system to the notion of the associated milieu proposed by 
Simondon as a response to the rampant advance of industrialization. I 
take the word protention from Husserl, for whom it means the anticipa-
tion of the next moment. Corresponding to the primary and secondary 
retention that we discussed before, there are also primary and secondary 
protentions: the primary protention being the anticipation of the im-
mediate coming moment, for example, melody when listening to a song, 
and the secondary protention being anticipation or expectation based 
on past experience. Protention is hence also imagination, through which 
we recollect and recognize what we have experienced and pro ject it into 
the future. By tertiary protention, I refer to the fact that in our every-
day lives, technology becomes a significant function of the imagination. 
Let’s look at a simple example: when people want to go to a restaurant, 
these days they are increasingly likely to search online first. We might 
also notice that Google is able to suggest which is the closest and most 
preferable restaurant for their needs according to its search and recom-
mendation algorithm. We can make at least two primary observations 
based on this example: (1) tertiary protention tends to depend on ter-
tiary retention, for example, the relations given by digital objects, those 
traces we have left, such as pictures, videos, or geolocations; and (2) ori-
entation becomes more and more an algorithmic process that analyzes 



222 LOGIC AND TIME

and produces relations to pave the way for the experience of the next 
now or the immediate future.

After the theory of Marshall McLuhan, André Leroi- Gourhan, and 
other thinkers of technics in the twentieth century, it is no longer a sur-
prise to say that technologies are the extension of the body. This also 
resonates with the work of some cognitive scientists and analytic phi-
losophers, such as Andy Clark and David Chalmers, who have proposed 
an understanding of the “extended mind.”1 The mind outside of the skull 
conditions the appearance and hence the experience of the phenomenon. 
Let’s follow Clark and Chalmers’s example of two protagonists, Otto and 
Inga, in their article on the extended mind. Otto suffers from Alzheimer’s 
disease. He is not able to remember things, so he relies on his notebook, 
in which he stores his notes and which acts as his externalized memory. 
Inga is normal and has proper access to her memory. If Inga wants to go to 
the Museum of Modern Art, she recalls that it is on 53rd Street, whereas 
if Otto wants to go to there, he will have to access his notebook to find 
out this information. Now there is a relation between Otto and the note-
book that is comparable to the relation between Inga and her mind. These 
extensions are spatial. It is probably only in the work of Bernard Stiegler 
that we see technics as time in the form of retentions. The body can ex-
tend following a technical lineage, but only through time can we retrieve 
the status of existence and put extension into question. This chapter is 
very much in debt to the works of Bernard Stiegler, especially his analysis 
of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason in the third volume of his Technics and 
Time 3— Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise. I want to develop 
the implications of the hypothesis that imagination itself is no longer the 
imagination of the subject but rather shifts from subject to algorithms and 
digital objects. How about things that we cannot experience, or that we 
can call nonexperience, such as the execution of an algorithm that gives 
us the givenness of digital objects? On one hand, as we have already stated 
in the first chapter, discussions of lower- level realities, such as atoms, elec-
trons, or logics, ignore the concreteness of phenomena, that is, the other 
factors that give rise to a perception of reality as such. On the other hand, 
we have also noted the ignorance of phenomenological inquiries, which 
bypass the lower- level reality and its relation to higher- level presentations. 
We cannot have an experience that an electron has just struck our skin, 
but we can imagine it; in like manner, we cannot experience the algorithm 
itself, but we can more or less imagine it within the limits of our cognitive 



 LOGIC AND TIME 223

capacity. What happens when such nonexperiences now concretely par-
ticipate in our imagination?

We can see that, more so than the “natural environment,” technology is 
engaging more and more in our thinking processes, not only in that our 
environment is full of gadgets but more importantly in terms of the logical 
capacities and operations of machines. With Edwin Hubble’s hundred- inch 
Hooker telescope, humanity suddenly discovered that there is nothing more 
fearful than the infinite.2 What people saw before their eyes were no lon-
ger simple objects like trees but the consequences of pre- pre- predicative 
experience: the mind reaches the world through the lens, without which 
there remain only trees in the garden and the walls that surround it. There 
is a distinction that we need to make here. Our engagement with technical 
systems is no longer the same as the encounter between Dasein and simple 
tools such as the telescope. Inside the system or an ensemble, decisions 
are systematically determined by algorithms instead of relying on the sub-
jective selection of significations. The obstacle to thinking about proten-
tion and algorithm together lies in the general conception of an opposi-
tion between imagination (time) and mechanism (formal logic), which 
has to do with the foundations of metaphysics. We still tend to believe in 
the human as the only subject that imagines; though machines produce a 
range of choices, the ultimate decision belongs to humans. In the follow-
ing sections, we will see why time and logic compete to be the ground 
of metaphysics by looking at the debate between the neo- Kantians and 
Heidegger. Heidegger wanted to retrieve the transcendental imagination 
of Kant instead of logic as the foundation of metaphysics. If transcenden-
tal imagination constitutes the foundation of metaphysics, to what extent 
can we also understand the tertiary protention in terms of a metaphysical 
question? And to what extent does this allow us to investigate the exis-
tence of digital objects? With our general method, we will try to under-
stand time and logic as two orders of magnitude and see how to push for-
ward the idea of tertiary protention by resolving (or jumping across) this 
division.

The First Kehre of Heidegger

We propose to consider three theories of experience concerning logic taken 
from Frege, Husserl, and Heidegger. The first two philosophers are logi-
cians who present distinct theories of pure logic with a peculiar relation to 



224 LOGIC AND TIME

psychologism, as we have seen in chapter 5. Heidegger is neither a logician 
nor a philosopher of logic; worse still, he has been accused of Continental 
irrationalism by some analytic philosophers.3 However, Heidegger has a 
peculiar relation to logic, and it is obvious that the question of logic plays 
a constitutive role in his career. The turn (Kehre) in late Heidegger is 
well known as the turn toward history of Being. But there was probably 
an earlier turn, occurring around 1925– 28,4 marked by the publication of 
Being and Time in 1927, prior to which, in his earlier writings from 1910 
onward, he was more concerned with studies on logic. Heidegger’s dis-
sertation on judgment and his Habilitationsschrift (1916) on Duns Scotus 
are both closely related to logic, and we can see how close his work is to 
neo- Kantianism and Husserlian phenomenology. In his reviews of recent 
developments in logic, he openly admired the work of Frege,5 especially 
the two articles we discussed in the last chapter. In his dissertation, super-
vised by the neo- Kantian Heinrich Rickert, he clearly proposes the apo-
dictic nature of logic, as John Caputo has summarized:

The essence of the logical judgement is found in the self- identical 
meaning (Sinn) which is unaffected by the circumstances in which 
the judgement is made or by the state of mind of the one who 
judges. The mode of reality of meaning is the realm of “validity” 
(Gelten, Geltensein), which constitutes the essence of logical being. 
Validity belongs to neither the psychical physical nor metaphysical 
realm, but to an irreducible and uniquely “logical” sphere.6

Heidegger’s position in the 1910s is still that of a disciple of Husserl, espe-
cially in relation to the Logical Investigations, which, according to Heidegger 
himself, he was amazed by but hardly understood.7 This Husserlian stance is 
clear, because after insisting on the purity of the logical sphere, Heidegger 
also criticizes mathematical logic for the fact that it is “formal, and so is 
unable to deal with the living problems of judgmental meaning, its struc-
ture and cognitive significance.”8 His work on Duns Scotus9 is basically a 
defense of Husserl’s phenomenology by use of scholastic philosophy and a 
reinvention of the latter using phenomenological terminology.10 This first 
turn in Heidegger is characterized by what he calls “hermeneutic logic” in 
Being and Time (which differs from his earlier interest in medieval philo-
sophical logic), and it was brought forth by his inquiry into the question 
of Being in Dasein’s everydayness. The Heideggerian hermeneutic (the 



 LOGIC AND TIME 225

fore- structure) has to be clearly distinguished from the pre- predicative 
experience that Husserl elaborated in his 1939 Experience and Judgement, 
as we will clarify later. Heidegger’s discussion raises a radical difference 
when compared with our studies of Frege and Husserl, but this radical-
ity is no longer ever about Gelten and Idealität; rather, it is to do with a 
metaphysical question about human existence and technics. The ultimate 
question throughout Heidegger’s career is, what is the meaning of Being 
(rather than τὸ τί ἐστι)? The breach that opens onto Heidegger’s critique is 
the question concerning language. Language, or discourse, or human ex-
pression in general, is the way things are made intelligible: communicating 
and determining and making manifest. Heidegger understands expression 
as a complicated structure that has a fundamental role in experience, one 
that is even prior to sight:

It is not so much that we see the objects and things but rather that 
we first talk about them. To put it more precisely: we do not say 
what we see, but rather the reverse, we see what one says about the 
matter.11

This is because Heidegger posits logos in ancient Greek not as language 
in its instrumental sense but rather as the process of disclosure.12 At the 
beginning of Being and Time, Heidegger attempts to render the mean-
ing of logos not as the rational but rather as talk, discourse (Reden). For 
Heidegger, the translation of ζῶον λόγον έχον as “man is the rational ani-
mal” must be reinterpreted as meaning “man is the animal that has the ‘po-
tentiality for discourse.’ ”13 Logos is now the way to the disclosure of Being. 
Hence logos as discourse (not language in the modern sense) has a greater 
affinity with the Being of beings than logos understood as reason, logic, 
and so on. Ζῶον is directly related with life “from a primary experience 
of discoursing as a specific mode of Dasein’s being.”14 Now this primary 
experience of λόγον— λέγειν (to lay down, put in order)— is the decisive 
moment of disclosure, of truth.15 The relation between truth and logos is 
complicated in this sense, and it is worth paying attention to what is meant 
by the statement “Dasein is always in truth and untruth.” In apophantic 
logic, truth is based on identification and derivation, the making- present 
of the objects intended. Such a making- present doesn’t apply in the case of 
absurdity, illusion, and so on, and this is why truth and untruth form the 
conditions on which an agreement is reached in terms of identification. In 



226 LOGIC AND TIME

hermeneutic logic, however, Heidegger proposed, truth presupposes be-
longingness rather than identification; truth (Aletheia) is at the same time 
concealment and disclosure, and Heidegger uses the word Beschicken, 
which can be translated as “co- sent.”16 The double sense of concealment 
and disclosure also conditions the “truth” and “untruth” of Dasein’s being. 
In general, we can try to understand three types of truth in Heidegger, 
namely, the truth of Being (ontologische Wahrheit), ontic truth (ontische 
Wahrheit), and propositional truth (Satzwahrheit).17 Ontic truth is related 
to propositional truth, especially in modern science and logic, because 
logic understood as the philosophy of science becomes the foundation of 
the judgment of ontic truth.

Heidegger and Wiener on Language and Time

Why, then, does this classification matter at all? Didn’t the computational 
turn at the beginning of the twenty- first century already render Heidegger’s 
critique impotent, as we came to understand in chapter 4 with regard to 
technological systems? We may observe that early cybernetics research, 
especially the work of Norbert Wiener, also presented language as mark-
ing the distinction between human beings and beasts. Wiener’s under-
standing was grounded in a scientific conception of nature. Heidegger was 
definitely aware of this. Indeed, he cited Norbert Wiener at length in 1965:

Norbert Wiener’s definition of the human being is as follows: 
“Man [is] an information [device].”18 Wiener goes on regarding the 
human being: “Nevertheless, one characteristic distinguishes man 
from other animals in a way which leaves no doubt: Man is animal 
that speaks. . . . It also will not do to say that man is an ensouled 
animal. For, unfortunately, the existence of the soul— whatever 
one may take it to be— is not accessible to scientific method of 
inquiry.”

As an animal who speaks, the human being must be represented 
in such a way that language can be explained scientifically as some-
thing computable, that is, as something that can be controlled.19

The consequence of this assessment, according to Heidegger, is that “if man 
is explained scientifically, then what distinguishes him from the animal— 
namely, language— must be represented so that it can be explained ac-



 LOGIC AND TIME 227

cording to scientific principles.”20 Now Heidegger’s question of language 
and logic must take a departure from this restriction to phenomena and 
descend instead to the basic question of human existence. In the works 
around the time of Being and Time, truth is not to be grasped but rather 
to be mediated through human experience, which doesn’t share the ab-
straction and detachment from the world of modern logic but is character-
ized by a belonging to the world. This belongingness can only be found 
in Dasein’s being- in- the- world as the presupposition of the hermeneutic 
logic. And being- in- the- world is nothing but the question of care21 (Sorge), 
or temporality. What Heidegger understands in this crisis of the gram-
matical and logical rendering of human discourse is precisely this ques-
tion of temporality, the transcendence of Dasein. Traditional logic is char-
acterized by the underlying “logico- grammatical parallelism” manifest in 
its categories, whereas Heidegger proposes that ancient Greek thought 
forms an exception to this general trend, as it “frees grammar from logic 
and [is able] to reconstruct linguistics on a more primordial ontological 
foundation.”22 One may be tempted to trace this back to the influence 
of Alexander von Humboldt’s philosophy of language, which Françoise 
Dastur has suggested forms the framework for Heidegger’s understand-
ing of language. Humboldt explored the complexity of Sprache not as a 
means for the “exchange of mutual comprehension” but as “a real world 
that the spirit must necessarily place between it and objects through the 
internal work of its force.” Humboldt sees speaking as a “spontaneity” 
(Selbst tätigkeit) that is “inexplicable in its being,” the work of the spirit that 
springs from deep humanity.23

The critique reveals two attitudes that still remain in opposition, if not 
antagonism, today. The opposition between them could be also under-
stood as the opposition between extension as instrument and intention as 
temporality. In order not to come to an immediate conclusion, we should 
go further and ask, on what ground does Heidegger make such a claim 
about and critique of logic? In modern philosophy, the split comes from 
the interpretation of Kant’s transcendental analytic, and if we want to ar-
rive at an analytical answer, then we cannot avoid going into an investiga-
tion of Kant. In Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, Heidegger proposes 
that Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason is an attempt to lay down the founda-
tion (Grundlegung) of metaphysics and that his own task in Being and 
Time is to ask the fundamental question underlined by Kant’s notion of 
Metaphysica Generalis:24 the meaning of being. What is the foundation that 



228 LOGIC AND TIME

Kant laid down in the first Critique and that Heidegger could take as his 
point of departure? It is precisely the question of time, posed as the ques-
tion of the transcendental imagination. Before we go into the details of 
Heidegger’s analysis, we may look at a famous example Heidegger used to 
demonstrate the temporal experience of discourse, and the detemporal-
ization in formal logic. Let’s consider the statement “the roses are blos-
soming” versus the existential statement in formal logic: ∃x:P(x), where 
x is Rose and P is the predicate Blossoming. When one says “the roses 
are blossoming,” there is imagination in which the body moves toward the 
present, whereas when truth is only concerned with the reference and the 
sense carried by it, as expressed in the second statement, then the sense 
doesn’t arouse the temporal experience of the present but only a reduction 
of the judgment’s content.25

A question immediately arises: on what ground can one say that tem-
poral experience constitutes the distinction between logos as discourse and 
formal logic? This question must be addressed by a metaphysical answer, 
which owes its foundation to Heidegger’s hermeneutic method: the search 
for and critique of presuppositions. Before we go into further reflection 
on this, we must make clear the connections between three different no-
tions of time here, which we can summarize as the time of transcendental 
imagination, the time of Dasein’s everyday experience, and historical time.

Kant’s Shrinking Back and the Nature of Synthesis

Heidegger had to find his explanation of the temporal experience, not in 
the mystery of the affectiveness of language, but in an analytic theory that 
shelters the temporal- ecstatic experience. Heidegger finds in Kant’s hav-
ing “shrunk back”26 (zurückgewichen) the problematic of the position of 
the Transcendental Imagination. In Edition A, imagination is regarded as 
a faculty that is not reducible to sensitivity or understanding but is the 
source of synthesis. In Edition B, Kant is frightened by the transcendental 
imagination, and he proposes instead that understanding alone assumes 
the role of origin for all syntheses and that the transcendental imagination 
is only one of the functions of it.27 Kant’s recoiling or shrinking back pre-
sents a possible inconsistency not only with Edition A but also with what it 
means to Heidegger: “in between (the two editions) pure reason as reason 
drew him increasingly under its spell.”28 The spell of the transcendental 
imagination becomes the foundation of understanding itself. Then what is 



 LOGIC AND TIME 229

the transcendental imagination in Heidegger’s reading? It is the synthesis 
of time. The transcendental imagination is the faculty that brings the pure 
intuition of time into order:

Transcendental power of imagination allows time as consequence 
of nows to spring forth, and as this letting- spring- forth it is there-
fore original time.29

Why is time so important to Kant? Isn’t time only one of the pure in-
tuitions, along with space, in Kant’s transcendental aesthetics? The rela-
tion that exists between the pure intuition of time, the transcendental 
imagination, and transcendental schematism needs to be briefly discussed 
here. In Critique of Pure Reason, Kant assigns the priority to time rather 
than to space, because he recognizes that all representations act inde-
pendently of their content and are “temporal in as much as they are all, 
external as much as internal, situated in the ‘flux’ of consciousness.”30 To 
simplify the argument, the pure look given by the pure intuition of time 
produces a pure image of the “now,” and it is also in this sense that Kant 
can say that “the pure image . . . of all object[s] of sense in general, however 
[is] time.”31 Transcendental schematism functions by determining time 
through articulating “the unique pure possibility of having a certain look 
into a variety of pure images.” That is to say, transcendental schematism is 
the “transcendental product of the power of transcendental imagination.”32 
Now we can see that time is of fundamental importance in Kant’s tran-
scendental philosophy, because it is through the a priori operation of time 
that experience is made possible. By quoting Kant’s view that time “apart 
from the subject is nothing,” Heidegger suggests that “this indeed implies 
that in the subject, it is everything.” Time constitutes the finitude of Dasein 
as well as the transcendence of its being. By the same token, Heidegger is 
able to assert that the “rootedness in time alone enables the transcenden-
tal power of imagination in general to be the root of transcendence.”33

This reading of Kant also implies that the syntheses are fundamentally 
temporal. It is necessary here to recapture the three syntheses proposed 
by Kant to facilitate the discussion of a fourth synthesis that serves as the 
base for tertiary protention. In Critique of Pure Reason, Kant gave three dif-
ferent orders of synthesis. The first is apprehension, meaning the process by 
which data that come into the mind are passively stored as manifolds. Kant 
makes a difference between synthesis and synapsis; the former is active, 



230 LOGIC AND TIME

the latter passive. Heidegger suggested that Kant should use the term syn-
dosis rather than synapsis, because synapsis already implies synthesis. It is in 
the synthesis of the manifold that time is given; that is to say, through the 
first synthesis, the manifold is put into temporal sequences. The second 
synthesis is recollection/reproduction in imagination; it differs from the first 
synthesis in that now the image is formed through the Einbildungskraft 
(power of imagination). The third synthesis is the synthesis of recognition 
in relation to a concept, which must at the same time be the recognition 
of sameness and the recognition of the concept’s unity.34 Heidegger uses 
three German words, Abbildung (likeness), Nachbildung (reproduction), 
and Vorbildung (pre- figuration), to characterize these three syntheses.35 At 
first glance, it is very clear that these syntheses have the role of putting 
what is perceived in relation to time.

Apprehension already discloses the being- with, and recollection dis-
closes the already- in, while recognition also means projection into the 
future, because recognition is already ahead of the past and the present. 
In the discussion of the past, Heidegger uses two German words, Gewesen-
heit and Vergangenheit: the latter means the past as characterized by works 
of historiography, whereas the former can be translated as “having been,” 
as something that is past but projects into the future, its continuity being 
preserved in Dasein’s being- in- the- world. Kant posited recognition as the 
third synthesis, but for Heidegger, it is the first, and by reversing the order 
of the syntheses, Heidegger identifies the transcendental imagination 
with his understanding of Vorstruktur (understanding, fore- structure), 
because “the arguments for the necessity of Abbildung , or likeness, and 
Nachbildung, or reproduction, depend on the argument for Vorbildung, 
or prefiguration.”36 That is to say, Heidegger has constructed a circle for 
the three syntheses. Hence he writes in Being and Time that discourse, 
understanding, and interpretation are equimodal: understanding has Vor-
struktur, in the form of Vorhabe (literally “fore- having,” as when one “has 
it in mind to do something”), Vorsicht (“foresight,” watching out for what 
is ahead), and Vorgriff (“pregrasping,” commonly translated as “anticipa-
tion”), while interpretation follows the as- structure, that is, the structure 
of the “in- order- to” (um . . . zu), which, as we saw in chapter 3, becomes the 
signification of the instrumental totality. We also have to recognize that 
the as- structure (interpretation) cannot function without the Vorstruktur: 
without the latter, Dasein wouldn’t know how to use a hammer. Thus there 
is discourse or verbal expression “only insofar as there is considering, and 



 LOGIC AND TIME 231

such a consideration of something as something possible only insofar as 
there is interpreting.”37 We will want to ask, what does this analysis imply, 
when syntheses are not considered to be separate operations but rather 
a cycle?

Temporal Synthesis and the Foundation of Metaphysics

The transcendental imagination as temporality distinguishes itself from 
schematization. Heidegger is able to use Kant to argue against the neo- 
Kantians’ view that categorical logic cannot be the basic science of meta-
physics38 and that Kant’s philosophy is not an epistemology but a ground- 
laying ontology. We have to bear in mind the shift from the critique of 
Kant that takes place from Being and Time in 1927 to the reinterpretation 
or defense of Kant in 1929. In Being and Time, Heidegger showed that the 
“I” for Kant is a “logical subject”— logical in the sense of being able to 
bind together, but not just a “concept obtained merely by way of logic.” 
“I think” is to Kant “not something represented, but the formal structure of 
representing as such, and this formal structure alone makes it possible for 
anything to have been represented.” The positive effects of Kant’s under-
standing of the “I” are, first, that it resists the reduction of the subject to 
substance and, second, that it rejects the notion of the subject as an entity, 
determining it rather as the event “I think.” Yet Heidegger went on to as-
sert that Kant was not able to interpret the “I” ontologically; instead, he 
slipped back into the Cartesian mistake:

he takes this “I” as subject again, and he does so in a sense which 
is ontologically inappropriate. . . . To define the “I” ontologically 
as “subject” means to regard it as something always present- at- 
hand. The- Being of the “I” is understood as the Reality of the res 
cogitans.39

In this reinterpretation, Heidegger argues that the “I think” is no longer a 
mere “logical subject”; it is “time” grounded in intuition, transcendental 
imagination, and understanding. This doesn’t mean that we should reject 
Kant’s logic in general but rather that logic cannot be taken as the ground; 
instead, the ground must be time qua transcendental imagination. That 
is, the rationalists’ approach, which takes objects as bearers of attributes 
and treats the unity of subject and predicate as bearing the structure of 



232 LOGIC AND TIME

propositions, has to be reassessed,40 because the understanding of the 
object doesn’t originate from thought but from time— the object is not 
merely determined by categories but rather relies heavily on the creative 
(schöpferisch) capacity of the intuition41 and the productivity of the tran-
scendental imagination:

That traditional logic does not treat the pure power of imagination 
is indisputable. Whether logic does not need to treat it in general 
if it understands itself, however— this, at least, must remain open. 
That Kant takes the point of departure for his questioning time and 
again from logic is similarly undeniable.42

If time now becomes a problem of metaphysics, it makes sense to re-
gard Heidegger’s Being and Time as a new take on the Kantian project. 
Now we can understand why Heidegger criticizes formal logic as detem-
poralization. The issue is not that the understanding of the logical state-
ment itself doesn’t involve time, and indeed, if we regard transcendental 
philosophy as the condition of possibility of the empirical experience, 
then the transcendental imagination must serve the understanding of 
the logical statement. Rather, it is a question of how the understanding 
of language as logical statement, by enacting a reduction of the philoso-
phy of language as a symbolic operation, already shields the question of 
temporality from its theory. And this exclusion of temporality will render 
the metaphysical knowledge based on it rootless. But then why does such 
an a priori of time matter at all? Because to Heidegger and his Kant, this 
understanding paves the way toward the answer to Kant’s fourth ques-
tion: what is human? If time is the primacy of human existence, then the 
Dasein in human beings must be approached through time; that is to say, 
the understanding of logos that characterizes the human being must be 
understood from temporality but not from logic. And language as the path 
to the truth of Being must share the same position as the transcendental 
imagination by rendering temporality as the primacy of Dasein intelligible. 
As Heidegger writes,

it is not because time functions as “form of intuition” and was 
interpreted as such at the point of entry into the Critique of Pure 
Reason, but because the understanding of Being must be projected 
upon time from out of the ground of the finitude of the Dasein in 



 LOGIC AND TIME 233

man, that time, in essential unity with the transcendental power 
of imagination, attained the central metaphysical function in the 
Critique of Pure Reason.43

Traditional logic, or metaphysics, according to Heidegger, must be re-
assessed through this process of ignorance or, more precisely, of forget-
ting. The neo- Kantians’ return to Kant for the ground of logic seems to 
ignore the difference between Edition A and Edition B. Heidegger asks, 
didn’t Kant’s modification in Edition B already give back mastery to the 
understanding but not to the transcendental imagination? This interpre-
tation leads him to ask, “Is it not a consequence of this that with Hegel 
metaphysics became ‘Logic’ more radically than ever before?”44 It is also 
no coincidence that we find in Husserl’s 1936 Crisis of European Sciences a 
similar concern: the crisis of logic.45 Heidegger shares Husserl’s suffering, 
if not his solution: the purity of logic, as the foundation of science, elimi-
nates genuine human experience.

The Fourth Synthesis after Kant

This grounding of logic as the foundation of metaphysics, which Heidegger 
criticized, anticipates a computational mind to come. When we look at the 
history of formal logic from Frege to Hilbert, then Gödel to Turing, we 
can easily see the connection between a computer and this specific read-
ing of Kant. Heidegger’s critique of logic leads to our reassessment of the 
foundations of the technical system and the tension between discursive 
relations and existential relations. Logical knowledge as apodicticity and a 
priori traverses human experience (whether psychological, imagination, 
phantasm, etc.) by creating a short circuit, and we can recall that Frege’s 
project was to “replace a merely synthetic understanding of arithmetic 
with an analytical one” in order to “speed up the process.”46 An analogy is 
drawn by the historian of philosophy Julian Roberts between this and the 
replacement of the analog with the digital in modern technology, so that 
time- consuming processes based on mechanical rules can be replaced by 
logic gates and all unnecessary “impurity” can be reduced to a minimum. 
Logical knowledge as the foundation of modern science and technology, 
in this sense, is itself technological.

Jean- Pierre Dupuy compares Kantian transcendentalism with AI, espe-
cially in the work of the cybernetician Warren McCullough, who had the 



234 LOGIC AND TIME

“intention to take up the challenge of providing a physical basis for syn-
thetic a priori judgement.”47 McCullough and Walter Pitts’s famous 1943 
paper “A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity” revived 
the Kantian motive: first, logic is viewed as the founding discipline of 
human understanding; second, the brain is considered a device that exe-
cutes logical principles.48 AI’s approach, whether in the form of represen-
tationism or connectivism, is no less such a Kantian project. To Dupuy, 
AI is precisely a naturalization of Kantian transcendentalism effected by 
depriving it of its subjectivity; that is to say, it becomes a transcendental 
philosophy without subject. We can probably follow Heidegger and say 
that the computational mind is one that is deprived of time/care because 
it is based on purely logical operations. This “timelessness” of the com-
putational mind put an end to metaphysics, as Heidegger might say, be-
cause it represents the completion of metaphysics, while a new way of 
philosophizing needs to begin. The a priori rules in AI are constructed a 
posteriori, just as the transcendental faculties in Critique of Pure Reason 
are constructed by Immanuel Kant, because they are in the end specula-
tions about how the human mind functions.

We can also see that this metaphysical difference contributes to the op-
position between culture and technologies. But if all logical thinking has 
to be grounded in transcendental imagination, then can we not also see 
these as two different orders, one coming out of logic, the other out of 
temporality? In the interpretation of Kant, Heidegger performed a sec-
ond transcendental deduction (compared to the transcendental deduction 
Kant discussed in Critique of Pure Reason) which proposes temporality as 
the ultimate a priori of philosophical thinking. Only through the reduc-
tion of the transcendental apprehension to time instead of schemas does 
it regain its transcendence without losing the world. And it is precisely 
through time that Heidegger opens a broader perspective for critique. 
For what is most important now is not the collection of pure rules that 
govern the synthesis but how time makes synthesis possible. This gives 
us one of the keys with which to resolve the difference of orders. Bernard 
Stiegler in Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise shows that in the 
third synthesis of Kant, or the primordial synthesis for Heidegger, recog-
nition demands a spatial exteriorization. It demands that something be 
re- cognized: something exists, but not in Dasein. The recognition hence 
needs memory support, which is technics. Technics, according to Stiegler, 
is the “spatialisation of the time of consciousness past and passing as 
Weltgeschichtlichkeit.”49 Stiegler criticizes Heidegger for missing the real 



 LOGIC AND TIME 235

problem, which is that the third synthesis “presupposes exteriorisation . . . 
as the initial force of all projection.”50 Stiegler has discovered here a new 
organization of time, in which it has to engage the support of memory. 
The fourth synthesis, a name Stiegler gave to it,51 has already reconstituted 
Dasein into a technical ensemble. Synchronization, which is the force of 
imagination, happens according not only to Dasein’s own consciousness 
but also to the time of the technical system.

If this reveals that it is with technology that the third synthesis can func-
tion properly as recognition, then we can see a new relation here between 
transcendental imagination and logic, because techno- logy presupposes 
λόγος. That is to say, through technics— but not in its pure form— logic 
returns to its place as the foundation of metaphysics. Technics brings to-
gether the two orders of magnitude. If our thesis so far makes sense, then 
we can ask about the role of the imagination in technics, which entails not 
only memory or objects for recognition, such as a recording, a drawing, 
but also programs, algorithms. The works of Jack Goody and Walter J. 
Ong52 demonstrate the relation between writing and cognitive processes 
as involving not only a functional transformation of the body through the 
use of tools but also a transformation of the mind. Two immediate pieces 
of evidence are given: first, technics offers us a storage function; second, 
the emergence of the visual domain (e.g., signs in written form in contrast 
to speech) made possible a different kind of inspection, a reordering and 
refining of meanings. Writings are technical objects that deal with single 
streams of data, whereas digitization allows the logical synthesis of large 
amounts of data and knowledge exceeding our imagination. This fourth 
synthesis that came after digitization brought us a new sensibility. This 
sensibility is no longer to be described in Kant’s terms as something purely 
passive and waiting to be synthesized; rather, it comes with a purpose, a 
force. The fourth synthesis also has its own characteristics of temporality. 
I suggest in the following section that we need to understand it through 
recursivity.

Algorithms as Synthesis

When Dasein picks up the hammer and hits the nail, it doesn’t usually do 
this for fun (although it may do) but rather to solve a problem, which re-
quires that it must follow a certain logic and set of constraints. When a 
tool is put to use, it always follows certain pathways. We can even find this 
in the hammer, which demands a simple procedure comprising lifting and 



236 LOGIC AND TIME

hitting. If logic sets up rules for reasoning, then we can probably say that 
an algorithm is a thinking process. Then what is the relation between al-
gorithm and logic? Let’s recall the computer scientist Robert Kowalski’s 
equation: Algorithm = Logic + Control.53 An algorithm is simply a logi-
cal operation by which to figure out different relations, and control here 
merely means the setting up of constraints; given that, for example, the 
terminal state is one of these constraints, to some extent we should under-
stand constraints also as relations. I propose to tackle the question of algo-
rithms on two different levels: first, in terms of the way it is understood in 
information science, and second, in terms of what I want to call machine 
hermeneutics, through a rereading of the history of the concept of the 
algorithm.

From the perspective of the design paradigm, two principles have to be 
introduced here, namely, (1) divide and conquer and (2) recursion. Actu-
ally, in some textbooks, the former is considered to include the latter,54 
but this obscures the important question concerning recursivity. Here I 
would like to understand them separately and make recursion the main 
focus of the discussion. Divide and conquer, as the phrase itself suggests, 
is a method that divides a problem into subproblems, conquering each 
subproblem and finally combining all the results to yield the final result. 
The cleverest and most complicated way of dealing with the subproblem 
is called recursion. Recursion, if a formal definition is desired, is “an algo-
rithmic technique where a function, in order to accomplish a task, calls 
itself with some parts of the task.”55 In fact, sometimes we do deal with 
recursions consciously in our daily lives, for example, Douglas Hofstadter 
made a joke about this in relation to the German language. German tends 
to put the verb at the end of the sentence. If grammar is strictly followed, 
we may hear a professor rambling for an entire lecture and finishing up 
by squeezing in a string of verbs, while everyone listening has lost track 
of what he has said.56 To understand recursion, we have to distinguish it 
from looping. Let’s consider an example: given a number x and given an 
integer n, compute x to the power n. The looping method will compute 
each multiplication up to n times within the function itself. The recursive 
method will divide it into two cases and call the function within the func-
tion itself until the condition is met, the running time of the looping func-
tion is O(n), and that of the recursive function is O(lg(n)), a significant 
improvement in performance. To make this example even more intuitive, 
we can imagine that the task is to generate n mirror images: (1) we can 



 LOGIC AND TIME 237

reproduce them one by one (as in Figure 19) or (2) we can set up two mir-
rors facing each other, and each mirror reflects the other to n/2 degrees (as 
in Figure 20).

The human mind can make sense of recursion but can hardly keep 
track of the recursive process.57 Google’s page rank is a recursive function, 
so that every link has a constant varying weight with multiple relations, 
and the page ranks are recursively calculated to maintain that they are “in 
time,” never obsolete. Our dependence on machines to handle data is due 
to not only the broadness but also the depth of the process. This vertical 
dimension is usually ignored in favor of simpler explanations that high-
light efficiency and large- scale processing. A recursive function calls itself 
as many times as possible until a terminal state is reached (i.e., n times). 
Recursion reaches deep down into the question of time. We may recall 
that Varela wrote, “What defines a machine is relations; the organization 
of a machine has nothing to do with its materiality, that is to say with the 
properties of its components that define it as a physical entity.  .  .  . Thus 
a Turing machine is a certain organization.”58 This statement clarifies the

238 LOGIC AND TIME

relevance of the connection between algorithm and relations. With algo-
rithms we see a new synthesis of relations, and recursion allows recogni-
tion and recollection to happen outside the three syntheses.

If we interpret relation as something ontologically fundamental and 
time as a type of relation (discursive) as well as a synthesis of relations 
(existential), then we can arrive at an understanding of what Varela and 
Maturana called structural coupling. I want to show in what follows that 
this coupling can be grasped in the making- present, or temporalization, 
of relations. Concerning the extended mind, the understanding of a mere 
human– tool feedback loop is insufficient. Although Clark did mention 
Varela and Maturana’s structural coupling59 several times in his discussion 
of the extended mind, he didn’t take phylogeny beyond intentionality 
and remained within a kind of formalism.60 This is why Hubert Dreyfus 
made the criticism that the concept of the extended mind falls into the 
Cartesian paradigm and shows merely “cases of temporal austerity— no 
rates and rhythms are involved.”61

Recursivity and Computational Hermeneutics

The preceding understanding of algorithm as recursion remains technical 
and not sufficiently philosophical; to make it so, we need to go further 
into the question of recursivity and its significance in logic and mathemat-
ics. In his book An Early History of Recursive Functions and Computability: 
From Gödel to Turing,62 the mathematician and historian of mathematics 
Rod Adams has outlined the development of the concept of recursivity 
in mathematical proofs from the mid- nineteenth century until the time 
of the Turing machine. In Adams’s account, Richard Dedekind was the 
first mathematician to use the term definition by recursion, in his 1888 
essay “Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?” (What are numbers and what 
should they be?), where he used it to deal with mathematical induction. 
This becomes quite clear in Dedekind’s examples, shown in Figure 21.

What does it mean to understand a number recursively? It entails the 
transformation of a number into a recursive function. This change be-
comes significant when we consider two further developments in mathe-
matics. The first was Thoralf Skolem’s 1923 paper “The Foundations of 
Elementary Arithmetic Established by Means of the Recursive Mode of 
Thought, without the Use of Apparent Variables Ranging over Infinite Do-
mains.” Skolem wanted to get rid of the notions of existence and universals 



 LOGIC AND TIME 239

in Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica, 
in which they often used the quantifiers “always” and “sometimes.” As a 
result, Skolem replaced existence with recursive functions. If consistency 
can be thought in terms of recursive functions, that means ontology no longer 
has priority over operation but the order is reversed:

If we consider the general theorems of arithmetic to be functional 
assertions and take the recursive mode of thought as a basis, then 
that science can be founded in a rigorous way without use of 
Russell and Whitehead’s notions “always” and “sometimes.” This 
can also be expressed as follows: A logical foundation can be pro-
vided for arithmetic without the use of apparent logical variables.63

The second move is Gödel’s development of the general recursive func-
tion as an equivalence to the Turing machine. The Turing machine and 
Church’s lambda calculus, as we know today, were responses to the Entscheid-
ungsproblem posed by David Hilbert, which we briefly discussed in the last 
chapter. Hilbert’s conception of algebra and geometry was different from 
those of mathematicians before him. The ambition of Hilbert was to re-
duce mathematics to symbolic logic so that all proofs could be reduced to 
formalized procedures. The Entscheidungsproblem concerns the comput-
ability of a natural number, and both Turing and Gödel showed that a so-
lution to Hilbert’s problem was impossible. Yet it was also by addressing 
this problem that Turing was able to develop what is today known as the 
Turing machine.

Turing’s response to Hilbert’s question involves a thought experiment 
that imagines a strip of paper tape of infinitive length, consisting of squares; 
there is a header that can read the symbols in the squares, compute them,

and give a corresponding state as output. In Turing’s conception, there are 
a few significant conditions: (1) he posits an idealized human computer 
whose state of mind is defined by the symbols upon which she is operat-
ing, (2) he requires that the computation process can be mimicked by a 
Turing machine, and (3) “the number of states of mind which need be 
taken into account is finite.”64 The mechanization of the mind is realized in 
the Turing machine as a mathematical tool for proof. This is clear from the 
formulation of the well- known Church– Turing hypothesis: “The intuitive 
notion of algorithms equals Turing machine algorithms.”65 It is in Gödel’s 
proof that we find the equivalence between recursion and the Turing ma-
chine. Gödel’s 1931 paper titled “On Formally Undecidable Propositions of 
Principia Mathematica and Related Systems” contains his theory of recur-
siveness. In contrast to the formalization of symbolic logic, Gödel arith-
metized the formal systems with numbers (known as Gödel numbers) so 
that the relations between different axioms could be expressed numeri-
cally. This new coding scheme follows the same logic of Hilbert’s treat-
ment of symbols— in themselves, they are meaningless.66 Today when we 
write a computer program, we can write a nonrecursive function, but we 
can basically reduce every operation and number to recursive functions. 
Because it is a process that is to a large extent independent of observation, 
this hermeneutics cannot be grasped as a separate process of the imagi-
nation. A recursive function only comes to a halt when a certain termi-
nal state is reached, while within the process, what is in the past is always 
ahead, because each function is expecting something to come, something 
that will bring the procedure to a close. When both humans and machines 
are understood from the fundamental perspective of relations, it produces 
a new faculty, which, as indicated earlier, I term tertiary protention,67 as a 
response to Stiegler’s tertiary retention (as well as based on it).

Tertiary Protention

How then can we grasp tertiary protention as a new synthesis of relations? 
Let’s consider an example: you go home after work, tired and sleepy; when 
you open the door, a freshly made coffee is already there waiting for you. 
The machine has prepared the coffee for you before you have decided to 
have one, because it knows that you would like (or will want) to have one. 
This is one of the examples of tertiary protention working from a distance, 
that is to say, of the imaginative force exerted from the outer world. Well-

collected and structured data and efficient algorithms make very good 
predictions of our movements, and we can no longer say that they are just 
retentions. The whole discipline of network analysis and human mobil-
ity analysis is dedicated to the study of statistical predictions. Without al-
gorithms, digital objects would be mere retentions residing on the hard 
drives of computers and servers. Through the analysis of data— or, more 
or less, through speculation— the machines are able to produce surprises 
(not just crises) by identifying a possible (and probable) “future,” a spe-
cific conception of time and space that is always already ahead but that we 
have not yet projected. We then see that tertiary protention is important 
for pre- pre- predicative experience, which in turn becomes our primary 
and secondary retention.

We can probably understand the synthesis of tertiary protention in 
both spatial and temporal dimensions through one of Heidegger’s key 
concepts, “making- present” (vergegenwärtigen). Making- present means 
bringing something forth into the “now.” Making- present is different 
from recalling, which means to bring the representation or imagination 
of something before us with the use of concrete figures, colors, narratives. 
In contrast, making- present is the ability of Dasein to make sense of any-
thing, even if it doesn’t exist or isn’t known, without thematization. For 
example, I can make- present a book by Heidegger even if I don’t know 
anything about its cover and content. The making- present is a function 
of time that is grounded in the vor- structure. It is a prethematic experi-
ence of things enabled by the already there in which I am situated; it is an 
outward movement to the world as temporal ecstasy. Heidegger illustrates 
this through the example of encountering the Feldberg Tower in the Black 
Forest:

In making- present we are not drawing upon memory as if we were 
searching around inside ourselves for representations. We are not 
inwardly directed. On the contrary, when we make- present the 
thing we are outside with it, oriented towards the tower, so that 
we can bring before ourselves all its properties, its full appearance. 
It can even happen that we can see the thing much more clearly 
and fully in making- present [Vergegenwärtigen] than in the hav-
ing present [Gegenwärtigen] of immediate perception. Suddenly 
we have something before ourselves which, as we say, we “didn’t 
notice” in immediate bodily seeing. But it is not representations, 



242 LOGIC AND TIME

images, memory- traces and the like, that we have before ourselves; 
it is rather that to which this having- before- oneself is directed, and 
solely directed— the existing tower itself.68

For Heidegger, making- present is contrasted against the present- at- hand, 
which presupposes a thematization, whereas making- present also means 
imagination. This seeing is also a process of making things intelligible by 
moving Dasein to the thing intended. It has the same logic that we dis-
cussed earlier in terms of the temporal- ecstatic relations involved when 
one says “the roses are blossoming.” Now, to make- present is to make 
sense of the meaning of objects as distinguished from their background, 
not through extraction, but through Dasein’s bodying- forth. This is very 
different from the Husserlian pre- predicative or predicative experience, 
because for Husserl, the pre- predicative experience is merely a passive 
sense impression, and the predicative experience is an intentional the-
matization. We might ask whether this hermeneutic recursivity implies a 
mode of languaging of machines because it is not only about predication 
but also about processing. If tertiary protention can be grasped as a mode 
of languaging, then we can see that a dialogue or negotiation has already 
taken place before each intentional grasp.

This languaging is different from our daily use of saying “think of a 
cup,” which brings forth a memory or idea of a cup. Rather, it means to 
orient, that is to say, to intuitively manifest the complex of relations on 
its own.69 This represents an important connection to our discussion of 
relations. Heidegger uses the example of driving: if you cannot make your 
home present when you are driving, you will never reach home. Indeed, 
Dasein is its relation to the world.70 To make something present is to pro-
duce the relations involved and hence to orient. What is meant by orienta-
tion? Orientation is the way we synthesize relations of different natures 
and are thereby able to make a corresponding decision. When a moun-
taineer is hiking in the mountains, he discerns his path by making judg-
ments based on the correspondence between the map, the stars, and the 
landscape. Orientation is not quite a question of space but more one of re-
lations; in fact, it is probably fair to say that space in this context becomes 
one type of these relations. “I” is always already “in” somewhere. But the 
“in” is not a physical present, as when, for example, when we are in the 
forest. “Being- in” is a movement toward something significant and mean-
ingful, so the “in” is at the same time “outward.” In the digital milieu, there 



 LOGIC AND TIME 243

is no space but only relations. The primary function of digital technolo-
gies, as we can see, is not merely to represent objects but to materialize 
and accumulate relations. And without these relations, there is no trans-
parency of action. The real time and immediate experience of the world 
reach far beyond human sight: things can be zoomed in on, zoomed out 
from, mixed up, rearranged. Without these data, one gets lost in the digi-
tal milieu, causing a sense of frustration and indecision. These relations 
are dynamic as well as imaginative. Every retrieval recursively refers to the 
present from the future.

In our investigation, we attempted to understand the opposition be-
tween logic and transcendental imagination, which constitutes the funda-
mental problem of metaphysics. We then sought to resolve this difference 
by mediating through technics of relations. We have also made a reduction 
here. This reduction is a negation neither of logic nor of time but rather 
a search of a ground with which can we talk about the fourth synthesis. 
The making- present of the machine belongs to its ability to synthesize re-
lations, which implies a shift from the understanding of qualitative data 
as sense and perception to the synthesis of qualitative data. In a network 
with rich metadata, our attention to the changes in the direct experience 
of time, of orientation, is demanded. Over the past few decades, the vast 
changes that transformed the Internet concretized and materialized rela-
tions and sped up their synthesis. Different kinds of digital objects that 
congeal different forms of sociality and temporalities are becoming more 
and more important in orientation. This is a departure from Heidegger’s 
critique of technology and logic, in which there is a sense of crisis due 
to the replacement that he foresees: that is, metaphysics will be replaced 
by cybernetics, language by logic, things replaced by objects, and so on. 
Logic doesn’t have temporal- ecstatic potential in its intrinsic nature, but it 
gains its position through synthesis rather than replacement. And it is pre-
cisely in the perpetual process of synthesis that the making- present, which 
has its origin in the synthesis of apperception, becomes technologically 
and quantitatively dependent.

If we allow the tertiary protention to enter into the transcendental 
imagination, then we can probably resolve the preceding opposition, as 
well as the one between Ontology and ontologies. Heidegger believed 
that the third synthesis, Vorbildung, was the most fundamental among all 
the other syntheses of Kant. This prioritization of the Vorbildung is two-
fold; on one hand, it designates the last step of Dasein’s making- present 



244 LOGIC AND TIME

after apprehension and recollection; on the other hand, it is also the prepa-
ration for entering the second circle of the formation of image, that is, a 
new circle of Abbildung and Nachbildung. For in the next “now,” what is 
perceived has a causal relation to what is before it. For example, someone 
points out to me something from a distance, then I follow his indication, 
and I see the object. Now we have the fourth synthesis, which is not an 
image (Bild) but a function that traverses and reorganizes other syntheses.

Repetition after the Fourth Synthesis

The question of technological convergence, first through networks, sec-
ond through the intervention of imagination, announced the end of hu-
mans as holding the central position among objects and being at the cen-
ter of knowledge— because humans now have to adapt to the rhythm of 
the technical system, not only physiologically and materially, as Marx de-
scribed, but also cognitively (making- present). If we take the fourth syn-
thesis as one of the features of the new technological system, we will easily 
arrive at the impression that we are more closely tied to other parts of the 
technological system. This convergence takes on another nature that no 
longer presents itself in a network form but is instead closer to symbiosis, 
as defined here by the computer scientist J. C. R. Licklider:

The fig tree is pollinated only by the insect Blastophaga grossorun. 
The larva of the insect lives in the ovary of the fig tree, and there it 
gets its food. The tree and the insect are thus heavily interdependent: 
the tree cannot reproduce without the insect; the insect cannot eat 
without the tree; together, they constitute not only a viable but a 
productive and thriving partnership. This cooperative “living to-
gether in intimate association, or even close union, of two dissimilar 
organisms” is called symbiosis.71

We are approaching such a state of symbiosis with machines, indeed, it 
is probably already here in some contexts. But is this really something 
that we should celebrate, or is the logic of symbiosis as an ontological un-
derstanding in itself problematic? In such a vision, the perfection of the 
fourth synthesis reconstructs the organization of images. Indeed, the tran-
scendental imagination is becoming a passive force of synthesis, because 
the recognition process can be short- circuited: the future is always the 



 LOGIC AND TIME 245

present. Deleuze, in Difference and Repetition, has identified this temporal 
structure as the third synthesis of time. The first synthesis of time is the 
time of habitudes, the Humean time that we discussed earlier in this book; 
the second synthesis of time is the active and passive synthesis of mem-
ory; the third synthesis of time is the repetition “by excess, the repetition 
of the future as eternal return.”72 It is clear that Deleuze wasn’t thinking 
about the tertiary protention of algorithms and digital objects; he was ad-
dressing the temporal constitution of subjectivity through three syntheses 
of time. In contrast to the repetition of passive habitudes and the repeti-
tion of memories, the third synthesis of time as the repetition of the future 
is the highest level of synthesis: the eternal return of the not- yet- present. 
Deleuze takes a similar path to Heidegger in taking time as the foundation 
of subjectivity, which is the form of the determinable in addition to the 
“I think” (determination) and “I am” (undetermined). Deleuze saw this 
as the cerebral response of Kant: “the form under which undetermined 
existence is determinable by the ‘I think’ is that of time.”73

The fourth synthesis that we have derived from the reading of Hei-
degger’s critique of logics contributes to another formulation of time, 
taking up my past and the past of those who I don’t know. It gives us a 
new form of determination that is not “I think” but “I guess you think . . .” 
We call it tertiary protention. The active synthesis of the tertiary proten-
tion gives us a future that is present, like the third repetition of Deleuze, in 
which “the present is no more than an actor, an author, an agent destined 
to be effaced; while the past is no more than a condition operating by de-
fault.”74 In the affirmation of the third repetition, we see also a detachment 
of the future and memory. Because neither memories nor habitudes are 
the determining factor any more, the projection is already there before 
their synthesis. Through the spatialization of both habitudes and memo-
ries in digital objects, the algorithms have already produced the synthesis 
without consulting the other syntheses. The third repetition is the repeti-
tion of signs, of symbols, of objects that I have encountered or that I may 
have encountered. Commenting on this third repetition, Deleuze wrote, 
“As Klossowski says, it is the secret coherence which establishes itself only 
by excluding my own coherence, my own identity, the identity of the self, 
the world and God.”75 For Pierre Klossowski, this repetition consists of the 
deepest thought of existence in the philosophy of Nietzsche.76 Deleuze’s 
comment on this coherence is illuminated by Pierre Klossowski’s answer 



246 LOGIC AND TIME

to a question about intensity posed by Jean Wahl (in a discussion at which 
Deleuze was also present):

It is about coherence: the perfect coherence of the circle as sign 
challenges my proper coherence in the way that I depend solely 
on a system of signs which suppose a beginning and an end, once 
for all. So the circle as sign, exerts on me a constraint that, in sum, 
demands, poses this dilemma: either you become mad, or you 
create an equivalence to your madness, and this is the Nietzschian 
tragedy. He prefers becoming mad to looking for a coherence.77

This coherence is re- created in the coupling of the distribution of inten-
sities already there with signs. The signs produce an amplification effect 
in the circle that leads to a change in structure. In this repetition, there 
is a will that determines its becoming: madness or its equivalence. But 
doesn’t this replacement of the tertiary protention here cause a risk or 
even a danger to this coherence? Signs produced through tertiary proten-
tion could turn the third repetition into habits, as is happening now with 
personalizations and recommendations on the Web. That is to say, it pro-
duces a kind of disindividuation (in a destructive sense instead of simply 
a phase change) by interfering in the synthesis of time. If we follow the 
analysis of Heidegger, we find this problematic formulated as the disrup-
tion of care. In Being and Time, Heidegger analyzed care as the primordial 
form of existence. On the basis of this understanding of care as time, he 
was able to analyze different structures of care, for example, the Besorgen 
that we have discussed. Heidegger further proposed to analyze Fürsorge, 
which is designated for analyzing the human Dasein who has the structure 
of Being- with. Fürsorge at the same time denotes worries about not being 
able to be there and the affirmation one can have of oneself. If we may 
put it this way, the former is passive, in the manner of affections, emo-
tions; the other is active, involving anticipations and preparation for the 
future. What is crucial in Fürsorgen is the act of “looking back.” Heidegger 
uses two words, Nachsicht (forbearance) and Rücksicht (considerateness), 
to describe the double nature of Fürsorgen as encompassing both worries 
and affirmations. We can interpret Rück-  as a spatial relation and Nach-  as 
a temporal relation, so taking care has both temporal and spatial dimen-
sions, whereby the action of looking back gives us imagination. Deleuze 
provided a similar interpretation when he wrote:



 LOGIC AND TIME 247

The role of the imagination, or the mind which contemplates in 
its multiple and fragmented states, is to draw something new from 
repetition, to draw difference from it. For that matter, repetition is 
itself in essence imaginary, since the imagination alone here forms 
the “moment” of the vis repetitiva from the point of view of consti-
tution: it makes that which it contracts appear as elements or cases 
of repetition.78

The “looking back” characterizes the primordial structure of Dasein’s 
own care, by which imagination is possible. The production of the ter-
tiary protention, which situates future as present, prevents access to the 
past as the primordial mode of the “I think.” This problematic is similar 
to that of das Man, because they can both present themselves as distrac-
tions; Dasein’s horizon is obscured by the invisibility that prevents it from 
penetrating into the question of Being. The fourth synthesis constitutes a 
new horizon that can further obscure the question of Being, because see-
ing is always already directed toward certain destinations before thinking 
arrives. That is to say, all synthesis has the possibility of becoming syndosis. 
Das Man is the “they” or the public that brings Dasein to the place where 
one loses oneself and the collective. Das Man is not social, it is not a com-
munity, but a fictitious “We”— another name for the consumer. Heidegger 
seems to have already anticipated this when he wrote,

The characteristic of the latter [information] is precisely to obstruct, 
from the beginning, our access to the forma, the essence, and the 
proper character of the being of things. Information precludes our 
ability to see forma.79

The organization of digital objects through the standardization of data 
structures and the invention of algorithms is not simply what has fashion-
ably been called the “organization of knowledge” but is also the organi-
zation of time. The making- present has its primordial mode of bodying- 
forth to the world, is redirected to the abstractness of the pseudo “We” 
and “I.” The imagination based on the programming of intersubjectivity 
through interobjective relations is an attempt to enact this, and it is no 
surprise to find that social norms are increasingly easily formed because 
of this programmability. That is to say, technological normativity is the 
source of social normativity.

Milieux after Systems: Toward a Mechanology

The industrialization of categories and algorithms has become the funda-
mental agent in the synthesis of time today. All kinds of censors, CCTV, 
and pattern recognition technics are contributing to the new form of 
protention. This is a technical tendency, rather than a technical fact, ac-
companying the digitization process. Modern technologies bring us much 
convenience, but this convenience as an expression of convergence (in 
terms of functionalities as well as of time and space) also threatens to re-
place care structures (both individual and collective) with the machine 
form of “care.” In fact, we are already experiencing many of these situa-
tions, from reminders to automatic updates and recommendations. This 
highlights the urgency not only of discussing the status of human beings 
but also of searching for a new structure of care (a task Bernard Stiegler 
has already made a concerted effort to undertake), without simply negat-
ing this tendency and evolution. The debate regarding the primacy of logic 
versus imagination points to a fundamental metaphysical question: a fun-
damental Ontology can no longer be fully grounded without taking tech-
nical systems into account. If I may simplify, I would say that philosophy 
in the first half of the twentieth century endeavored to understand human 
existence ontologically. In the second half of the century, the deconstruc-
tion of the concept of the human through the discovery of its dependence 
on the prosthesis of technics led to the concept of the inhuman or post-
human, but this understanding is still ontological in the sense that it seeks 
to categorize the inhuman. We can also understand from this perspective 
the rise, and eventually the triumph, of the phrase technical system over 
technical milieu. But when we take technology into account, such an on-
tological understanding doesn’t have much to say besides expelling the 
human from the center. The fact is that we cannot even derive an ontology 
of technology, because it may not even exist. It is probably more appropri-
ate to follow what Simondon calls ontogenesis. If this book has succeeded 
in bringing this point to light, the implication is that a new critique or con-
ceptualization of the human– inhuman should take technical systems into 
account to analyze them together as relations.

Simondon didn’t explicitly express as much, but his analysis of the asso-
ciated milieu points in a similar direction. His conceptualization of human 
beings as technical beings, and as technical individuals at a certain moment 
of history, shows that a relation between the living being and technology 
needs to be analyzed technically. This gives us the imperative to discuss 



 LOGIC AND TIME 249

milieux after systems— another retrieval (Wiederholung/répétition). The 
associated milieu is not a milieu that is outside of technical objects; on 
the contrary, the associated milieu is inside the technical individual and 
the technical ensemble, serving at the same time the role of a natural mi-
lieu and a functionality, as shown in the example of the Guimbal turbine, 
where the river is the associated milieu of the engine. The river drives the 
turbine, engendering its movement, while at the same time it takes away 
the heat produced by the engine (though this energetic efficiency is un-
likely to carry over into the ecological effects upon the other organisms in 
the river). The associated milieu is not a structure. A milieu has a recurrent 
causality, whereas a structure does not. Structures are forms, like ontolo-
gies. Forms are at the front, but they also need a ground, because it is the 
ground that carries them. Without the ground, forms cease to be. The ig-
norance of the relation between form and ground has been the source of 
erroneous thinking in the analysis of imagination:

Until today imagination has been badly analysed, because forms 
have been invested with a privilege of activity and considered as 
having the initiative of the psychic and physical life.80

Such a misunderstanding leads to the inability to solve the problem of 
alienation: because for Simondon, alienation is due to the rupture be-
tween form and ground, the associated milieu can no longer regulate the 
dynamics of forms. That is to say, forms affect the ground in such a way 
that the ground is not able to maintain its own coherence.81 In this anal-
ogy, life is the ground and thoughts are forms. Without life, there is no 
thinking being. We can also say that between discursive relations and exis-
tential relations, which constitute care, there is a similar relation between 
forms and ground. Now, because of the technology of digitization, we can 
easily materialize, analyze, and transform discursive relations into material 
forms. But for a transformation to be carried out, we should bear in mind 
how these forms contribute to the ground, both in terms of technical com-
patibility and the structure of care. The question is, how are we going to 
identify the concurrent causality between these two orders, and hence to 
reorganize the associated milieu and its corresponding relations? The de-
tails certainly vary from one case to another, but an analysis of the ground 
is necessary before the forms can be transformed. This could be the gen-
eral principle for the discipline Simondon envisaged: mechanology. Such 



250 LOGIC AND TIME

a philosophically and technologically informed discipline, which would 
work against alienation, is still in its very early stage. Here I can only offer 
an example to demonstrate how this could be thought through in terms of 
technological development, and I would like to use this example to con-
clude this chapter by outlining how a metaphysical critique could be real-
ized in material terms.

One of the projects that I worked on with Bernard Stiegler and Harry 
Halpin at the Institut de Recherche et d’Innovation, starting in 2012, 
aimed to develop a new concept of the social network as an alternative 
to Facebook.82 I started with a study on the materialization of social rela-
tions, which we can trace back to the method of sociometry developed by 
the American social psychologist Jacob L. Moreno. Moreno was one of the 
first sociologists to demonstrate the value of graph- theoretical approaches 
to social relationships. The most often quoted example is Moreno’s work 
at the New York State Training School for Girls in Hudson, where the run-
away rate of the girls was fourteen times higher than the norm. Moreno 
identified this as being a consequence of the particular network of social 
relationships among the girls in the school, which he followed by creating 
a simple sociological survey to help him “map the network.” The survey 
was based on simple questions such as “who do you want to sit next to?” 
Moreno found from the map that the actual allocation plan of the girls in 
different dormitories created conflicts; he then used the same model to 
propose another allocation plan that successfully reduced the number of 
runaways. His belief in the value of representing social relations by “chart-
ing” prompted Moreno to write that “as the pattern of the social universe 
is not visible to us, it is made visible through charting. Therefore the so-
ciometric chart is the more useful the more accurately and realistically it 
portrays the relations discovered.”83

These relations are what we have called discursive relations here, in this 
case materialized as lines and numbers on the map. We may also observe 
that in Moreno’s methodology, every individual was considered a social 
atom; the society represented on this basis is a network composed of social 
atoms linked together by discursive relations. Here we see a clear instance 
of neglect of the question of the ground, as forms are taken as the total-
ity. Individualism is promoted through technological networks. In 1933, 
when Moreno published in the New York Times an article titled “Emotion 
Mapped,” he suggested drawing a sociometric map of New York City: in 
fact, he was only able to produce such a representation for a community 



 LOGIC AND TIME 251

of 435 people, yet nowadays, with tools such as Facebook, Moreno’s dream 
is no longer impossible.84 Social networking websites like Facebook stay 
within the sociometric paradigm by materializing social relations in terms 
of digital objects and allowing new associations based on different discov-
ery algorithms to emerge. If we look at the Graph API that defines the core 
data structure of Facebook,85 we should not be surprised to find that the 
analysis of digital objects in the earlier chapters of this book is applicable.

We can identify several core factors that lead to alienation in this new 
industrial model. Specific to our discussion here, within this network, 
we can say that time and, equally, the attention of each social atom 
are sliced into ever smaller pieces and dispersed across the networks by 
status updates, interactions, advertisements— the mechanisms of tertiary 
protention— for marketing purposes. One can spend hours on Facebook 
out of curiosity without achieving anything. The “collective” on Facebook 
becomes a distraction. The core idea of our project is to develop a group- 
based social network based on Simondon’s concept of collective individu-
ation. In this conceptualization, projects— which must also be under-
stood here as projections— are prioritized instead of being subject to the 
random status updates of individuals. In the projection of a project, we are 
already ensconced in the question of care, of Fürsorge, that reorganizes the 
structure of time in favor of its own integrity. The question, then, is, how 
can we transform individuals into groups? One of the answers that we pro-
posed is through finding mechanisms to regulate these relations, in other 
words to set up what I call creative constraint. That is to say, after registra-
tion, the user can only use the full functions when he or she participates 
in a group or creates a project. This rearrangement of relations makes the 
group and project the default instead of the individual. The group can 
have liaisons with other groups and create intergroup relations, which 
comprise a milieu. In this sense, we can see that the project and the group 
become the associated milieu for the individual and other groups and also 
the mediators between discursive relations and existential relations.

This last chapter ends with this example as an illustration of how the 
question of convergence can be appropriated and practically realized 
within the framework of the theory of relations that we have developed 
here. The aim of going through such a long detour from Heidegger to 
Deleuze, from logic to algorithm, was to propose how technics is fun-
damentally philosophical, if not metaphysical, and how philosophy is as 
practical and technical as one may think technics to be. At stake, as shown 



252 LOGIC AND TIME

in this chapter, is the synthesis of time produced by algorithms. Engineers 
are building the world: as Tim Berners- Lee proudly announced, the ex-
perts creating the Web are philosophical engineers, and the semantic web 
is a philosophical engineering project. The purpose of this book is to show 
how much more broadly it is possible, and necessary, to reflect on the is-
sues raised by technological development by meditating on digital objects. 
The technical system is already here, and a more rigorous method needs 
to be invented that will at the same time be theoretically informed and 
practically realizable. Some art practices may have given us some insight 
into the development of techniques, but a more systematic approach must 
be developed, and I hope in this book to have succeeded in outlining some 
entry points into the further development of such thinking.

Acknowledgments

This book is an exercise and an experiment that have taken al-most ten years of time, across three periods of study and research 
in London, Paris, Berlin, and Lüneburg. This work is indebted to many 
thoughts and people I came across during these years in Europe after leav-
ing Hong Kong in 2006. Two critical moments in 2008 shaped the direc-
tion of this research and its method: a critical illness shed new light on 
a reading of Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit, concerning death, technologies, 
and friendship, and later in the year an encounter with Professor Bernard 
Stiegler shaped the style of the book’s philosophizing, which became a 
dialogue between Heidegger and Simondon, not only as a question of 
digital objects but also as a question of existence. The generous support 
and patience of Professor Matthew Fuller and the inspiration of Profes-
sor Scott Lash since the London years were crucial to the completion of 
this work.

Heidegger’s commentary on Rimbaud’s “Lettre du Voyant”: “In Greece . . . poems 
and lyres turned Action into Rhythm. After . . . poetry will no longer beat within 
action; it will be before it.”

tions d’échelle cher Simondon,” Appareils 2 (2008), http://appareil.revues.org/595.
 7. “How about things that we cannot experience, or that we can call nonexpe-
rience, such as the execution of an algorithm that gives us the givenness of digital 
objects? .  .  . We cannot have an experience that an electron has just struck our 
skin, but we can imagine it; in like manner, we cannot experience the algorithm 
itself, but we can more or less imagine it within the limits of our cognitive capac-
ity. What happens when such nonexperiences now concretely participate in our 
imagination?” (chapter 6).
 8. The reticulated digital object weaves “a programmable memory that largely 
distinguishes between the technical objects of Simondon and Heidegger and 
digital objects as the technical milieu and programmable context. This gives us 
the second “given” of the word datum (the first referring to sense data).” These 
analyses of the digital object are conducted through examples of the everyday

features of the twenty- first century: “We finish this chapter with an example of 
our experience on YouTube to illustrate how the milieu has taken on a different 
role” (chapter 3).
 9. In 1901, in section 6 of the Fifth Logical Investigation, Husserl posited that 
a consciousness is a flux consisting of retentions and protentions. In 1905, he took 
these studies of the retentional and protentional structure further and established 
that we must distinguish primary retentions, which constitute the temporality of 
perception, from secondary retentions, which form the recollections of memory, 
that is, consciousness of the past. In 1936, he posited in The Origin of Geometry 
that writing is the condition of constitution of the flux of consciousness in which 
geometric thought forms. I call tertiary retention the written grammatization that 
allows control to be taken of primary and secondary retention and the projection 
of those new forms of protention constitutive of Greek logos (and I have extended 
the concept of tertiary retention to all forms of mnesic exteriorization— which 
commence at the beginning of hominization). This grammatization is a spatial-
ization of time, and it is spatialization that enables control and, in return, the re-
tentional and protentional release of writerly and readerly consciousness. On this 
question, see also Bernard Stiegler, States of Shock: Stupidity and Knowledge in the 
21st Century, trans. Daniel Ross (Cambridge, Mass.: Polity Press, 2015), 108– 21, for 
an analysis of reading and writing as conditions of the speculative proposition in 
Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit.
 10. In the section titled “Recursivity and Computational Hermeneutics,” Yuk 
Hui writes in chapter 6, “Today when we write a computer program, we can write 
a nonrecursive function, but we can basically reduce every operation and number 
to recursive functions. Because it is a process that is to a large extent independent 
of observation, this hermeneutics cannot be grasped as a separate process of the 
imagination.”

 14. Hegel demonstrates this with the example of a figure distorted by the re-

explain, not the principle of refraction of light itself, but rather the experience of 
it, which constitutes the true knowledge.
 15. Hegel, Logic of Hegel.
 16. Hegel shares Goethe’s opposition to the Newtonian understanding of white 
light as the spectrum of colors and interprets it rather as a unity between light and 
darkness; see Stern, Hegel, Kant, and the Structure of Objects, 80.
 17. Heidegger and Hegel, Hegel’s Concept of Experience, 20.
 18. Ibid., 22.
 19. Husserl’s connection with Hegel, in my view, can be made through Hei-
degger, especially through his understanding of Hegel’s concept of experience and 
Husserl’s notion of categorial intuition.
 20. The absence of technical objects in Husserl is further elaborated by Bernard 
Stiegler in Technics and Time, vols. 1 and 2. Stiegler has shown that Husserl was 
able to talk about primary and secondary retention, but not tertiary retention, 
which is one of the most important elements of technical objects.
 21. It is also because of the Industrial Revolution that philosophy of technol-
ogy started to emerge in Europe in the nineteenth century, especially in Germany, 
with figures such as Ernst Kapp (1808– 96), Manfred Schröter (1880– 1973), Friedrich 
Dessauer (1881– 1963), Martin Heidegger (1889– 1976), Günter Anders (1902– 92), 
and in the twentieth century in North America, with figures such as Lewis Mumford, 
Albert Borgmann, Don Ihde, Carl Mitcham, and Andrew Feenberg.

 53. Tuple literally means a group of variables, for example, (plant, animal), 
(3, 5). The TRC is based on specifying a number of tuple variables that range over 
a relation. It can be illustrated with a simple example. Consider a company that 
has the following information inside its relational database: EMPLOYEE (SSN, 
Name, Bdate, Address, Salary, Dept Id); the query of a TRC would be something 
like “Find all employees whose salary is greater than 30.000,” or {t∣t EMPLOYEE 
∧ t. Salary>30. 000}.
 54. DRC uses domain variables (instead of tuples) that take values from an 
attribute’s domain. Consider the same example we used in the previous foot-
note: find all employees whose salary is greater than 30.000, or {< id,n,b,a,s,d>∣< 
id,n,b,a,s,d > EMPLOYEE ∧ s > 30.000}.

 20. A reciprocal causality can be illustrated with Simondon’s example of the 
operation of a turbine surrounded by water: the water can absorb the heat gener-

cooling effect on the machine. There is a reciprocal process within this interaction 
of the two elements.

 44. In this perspective, Cantwell Smith displays some Heideggerian motifs, es-
pecially when he criticizes the subject and object separation, in contrast to which 
for him “the conclusion is actually very simple: the world, our world, is one.” This 
is similar to what Heidegger calls being- in- the- world.

 46. Ibid., 350.
 47. Ibid., 226.
 48. It is on this point that Bernard Stiegler proposes that idealization can only 
exist when the product of ideation is exteriorized as technical object, which is also 
a passage from primary and secondary retention to tertiary retention.

 44. We will later see the similarity between Hume’s atomism and Russell’s logi-
cal atomism.
 45. Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 25.
 46. For Empiricism, synthetic judgment a priori is impossible because the syn-
thetic is necessarily empirical. It must therefore be a posteriori, while Kant’s Cri-
tique of Pure Reason aims to explain how synthetic judgment a priori is possible.
 47. Deleuze, Empiricism and Subjectivity.
 48. Bains, Primacy of Semiosis, 68.
 49. Bains thinks that Hume did not discover relations to be ontological; they 
only become ontological after Deleuze’s radicalization. However, Deleuze himself 
credits Hume with this discovery of ontological relations as something external to 
their terms. Also, as we have already demonstrated in our discussion of Husserl’s 
radical interpretation and Hume’s rejection of substance, it is clear that Hume 
had already developed a theory by which to understand all phenomenal objects 
in terms of relations. It also worth mentioning that for Hume, even the self is rela-

jectivity with empiricism, because the self is always a play of relations and beliefs.

 79. Russell, Principles of Mathematics, section 24. Russell said that Peirce and 
Schröder also spotted the importance of this subject, however, he then criticized 
them by saying that as they did not base their method on Giuseppe Peano (the

theory is too cumbrous and difficult to have any practical application.

different from the individuals Deborah and Jim. Thus, if the individuals Frank 
and Deborah are both values for a property that is stated to be functional (thus 
the property has at most one value), then there is a contradiction. Explicitly stat-
ing that individuals are different can be important when using languages, such 
as OWL (and RDF), that do not assume that individuals have one and only one 
name. For example, with no additional information, a reasoner will not deduce 
Frank and Deborah as being referred to as distinct individuals.

1/86,400 of a mean solar day, but then it was recognized that the earth doesn’t 
have a regular rotating rate, so a “leap second” was added to compensate for the 
slowing rotation. Unless high precision is demanded, UTC can be regarded the 
same as GMT in terms of temporal indication.

the way back to Zeno’s paradoxes, which suggest that if time can be reduced infi-

temporal change. But if, following Bergson, time can only be thought as duration, 
then the basis of the paradoxes is apparently invalid.

and Pan’s paper is also based on Allen’s ontology. These are the temporal relations 
specified in the ontology of James Allen.

 NOTES TO CHAPTER 5 271

 22. Berners- Lee, “Semantic Web as a Language of Logic.” In this note, Berners- 
Lee was discussing Frege’s failure (Russell’s paradox) and asking about the pos-
sibility of redefining validity: “When Frege tried second- order logic, I under-
stand, Russell showed that his logic was inconsistent. But can we make a language 
which is consistent (you can’t derive a contradiction from its axioms) and yet al-
lows enough to for example: Model human trust in a realistic way Write down 
the mapping from XML to RDF logic to allow a theorem to be proved from the 
raw XML (and similarly define the XML syntax in logic to allow a theorem to be 
proved from the byte stream), and using it.”
 23. Davis, Engines of Logic, 52.
 24. More exactly, the task is to prove that one can apply the rules of FOL to a 
system of axioms for the natural numbers, now known as Peano arithmetic.

 33. Ibid., 25.
 34. Davidson, Truth and Predication, 147.
 35. Ibid., 133. Frege accepts the fact that the reference may not actually exist 
but contends that it must be real and objective. For example, consider this ex-
pression: “Odysseus deeply asleep was put to shore in Ithaca.” Frege claims that 
“whether the name Odysseus has a reference is therefore immaterial to us, as long 
as we accept the poem as a work of art.” When we talk about Odysseus as, on one 
hand, someone who may have existed at the time of Homer or, on the other hand, 
someone who only exists in Homer’s epic, how can we be referring to the same 
Odysseus? How can we guarantee the identity of a proper name as such? This di-
lemma is further taken up by Bertrand Russell as part of a theory of acquaintance 
in his famous article “On Denoting.”

world in general, who is blind to the fact that all the truths he attains as objective 
truths and the objective world itself as substratum of his formulae (the everyday 
world of experience as well as the higher- level conceptual world of knowledge) 
are his own life- construct developed within himself— this naïveté is naturally no

 67. Luhmann, Art as a Social System, 139. “Meaning serves as the medium not 
only of communication but also of consciousness. One must therefore conceive 
of the specificity of this medium in very general terms without assuming a psychic 
or social- system reference. The formal specificity of meaning, whose formative 
capacity qua medium we introduced earlier, manifests itself in phenomenological 
as well as in modal- theoretical analyses. Both types of analysis presuppose a tem-
poral restriction of meaning, a time- related actualization of meaning in an instant 
of experience or of communication.”

 5. Heidegger, Gesamtausgabe, 1:20. “G. Freges logisch- mathematische For-
schungen sind meines Erachtens in ihrer wahren Bedeutung noch nicht gewür-
digt, geschweige denn ausgeschöpft. Was er in seinen Arbeiten über ‘Sinn und Be-
deutung,’ über ‘Begriff und Gegenstand’ niedergelegt hat, darf keine Philosophie

 7. Heidegger, “My Way to Phenomenology,” in Time and Being, 76. “How-
ever, my repeated beginning also remained unsatisfactory, because I couldn’t get

procedure which called itself ‘phenomenology’ was to be carried out.”

 9. Half of the Grammatical Speculation was written by Thomas of Erfurt 
rather than Duns Scotus. Heidegger was aware of this, but he was satisfied with 
the work regardless; in a reply to a letter from Martin Grabmann ( January 7, 
1917), he stated, “Perhaps it is interesting for you to hear that the work has been 
illuminating for Husserl to such an extent that I can be satisfied. Also Rickert now

 21. Heidegger uses three German words that share the same root of Sorge: 
Sorge (care), Besorgen (concern), and Fürsorge (solicitude). Besorgen refers to the 
mode of ready- to- hand, and Fürsorge is related to being with others. Sorge, care, 
bears a preontological significance in the fable Heidegger quotes, in which man is 
named after care.

 NOTES TO CHAPTER 6 275

 24. Heidegger proposes the distinction between Metaphysica Specialis and 
Metaphysica Generalis; the former refers to theology, cosmology, and psychol-
ogy, the latter to ontology, which we can understand as an attempt to recover the 
question of being after definition of the subject of metaphysics in the medieval 
time after Avicenna and Thomas Aquinas. For Heidegger, Kant’s task is to lay the 
foundation for Metaphysica Generalis, for ontological knowledge, in the name of 
transcendental philosophy.

 59. Varela and Maturana defined the structural coupling as a phylogenetic 
process: “As long as a unity does not enter into a destructive interaction with its 
environment, we as observers will necessarily see between the structure of the 
environment and that of the unity a compatibility or congruence. As long as this 
compatibility exists, environment and unity act as mutual sources of perturba-
tion, triggering changes of state. We have called this ongoing process ‘structural 
coupling.’ ” See Maturana and Varela, Tree of Knowledge, 99.
 60. Maturana was critical of formalism, especially mathematical formalism 
as the understanding of system: “A mathematical formalism is a conceptual and 
operational system that reveals the relational coherences of the space that it de-
fines. It is because of this that one can use mathematical formalisms to compute 
changes of states in systems whose operational coherences appear isomorphic 
to the relational coherences that they specify. But mathematical formalisms do 
not by themselves create an understanding of the phenomena that an observer 
helps to explain through them. In this same context one can say that biological 
phenomena occur on the edge of chaos, because one can use some mathematical 
formalisms as evocative metaphors. However, to say that does not say what kind 
of systems living systems are, nor how they exist in the new domains that arise as 
their operation as totalities begins to be conserved in the flow of their structural 
coupling with the medium that arises with them. Living systems, as do systems in 
general, occur in their happening as actual discrete singular entities, not in the for-
malisms that an observer may use to think about them.” Maturana, “Autopoiesis, 
Structural Coupling, and Cognition.”
 61. Dreyfus, “Why Heideggerian AI Failed”: “Clark’s and Chalmers’s exam-
ples of extended minds manipulating representations such as notes and pictures 
are clearly cases of temporal austerity— no rates and rhythms are involve,” and 
later, “[Michael] Wheeler’s cognitivist misreading of Heidegger leads him to 
overestimate the importance of Andy Clark’s and David Chalmers’s attempt to 
free us from the Cartesian idea that the mind is essentially inner by pointing out

 NOTES TO CHAPTER 6 277

that in thinking we sometimes make use of external artifacts like pencil, paper, 
and computers. Unfortunately, this argument for the extended mind preserves 
the Cartesian assumption that our basic way of relating to the world is by using 
propositional representations such as beliefs and memories whether they are in 
the mind or in notebooks in the world.”
