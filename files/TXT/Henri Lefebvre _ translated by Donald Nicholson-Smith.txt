Plan of the Present Work 

I 

Not so many years ago, the word 'space' had a strictly geometrical 
meaning: the idea it evoked was simply that of an empty area. In 
scholarly use i t  was generally accompanied by some such epithet as 
'Euclidean' ,  ' isotropic', or ' infinite', and the general feeling was that the 
concept of space was ultimately a mathematical one. To speak of 'social 
space', therefore, would have sounded strange.  

Not that the long development of the concept of space had been 
forgotten, but it must be remembered that the history of phi losophy 
also testified to the gradual emancipation of the sciences - and especial ly 
of mathematics - from their shared roots in traditional metaphysics. 
The thinking of De§.qrtes was viewed as the decisive point in the 
working-out of the concept of space, and the key to its mature form. 
According to most h istorians of Western thought, Descartes had brought 
to an end the Aristotel ian tradition which held that space and time were 
among those categories which faci l i tated the naming and classing of the 
evidence of the senses. The status of such categories had hitherto 
remained unclear, for they could be looked upon either as simple empiri­
cal tools for ordering sense data or, a l ternatively, as generalities in some 
way superior to the evidence supplied by the body's sensory organs. 
With the advent of Cartesian logic, however, space had entered the 
realm of the absolute. As Object opposed to Subject, as res extensa 
opposed to, and present to, res cogitans, space came to dominate, by 
containing them, al l  sensi:s apd al l  bodies. Was space therefore a divine 
affribute ? Or was it an order immanent to the total i ty of what existed ? 
Such were the terms in which the problem was couched for those 
philosophers who came in Descartes's wake - for Spinoza, for Leibniz,

for the Newtonians. Then Kant revived, and revised, the old notion of 
the category. Kantian space, albeit relative, albeit a tool of knowledge, 
a means of classifying phenomena, was yet quite clearly separated (along 
with time) from the empirical sphere: it belonged to the a priori realm 
of consciousness (i.e. of the 'subject'), and partook of that realm's 
internal, ideal - and hence transcendental and essentially ungraspable -
structure. 

These protracted debates marked the shift from the philosophy to the 
science of space. It would be mistaken to pronounce them outdated, 
however, for they have an import beyond that of moments or stages in 
the evolution of the Western Logos. So far from being confined within 
the abstractness with which that Logos in its decline endowed so-called 
pure philosophy, they raise precise and concrete issues, among them the 
questions of symmetry versus asymmetry, of symmetrical objects, and 
of the objective effects of reflections and mirrors. These are all questions 
to which I shall be returning because of their implications for the analysis 
of social space. 

II 

Mathematicians, in the modern sense of the word, emerged as the 
proprietors of a science (and of a claim to scientific status) quite clearly 
detached from philosophy - a science which considered itself both 
necessary and self-sufficient. Thus mathematicians appropriated space, 
and time, and made them part of their domain, yet they did so in a 
rather paradoxical way. They invented spaces - an 'indefinity', so to 
speak, of spaces: non-Euclidean spaces, curved spaces, x-dimensional 
spaces (even spaces with an infinity of dimensions), spaces of configur­
ation, abstract spaces, spaces defined by deformation or transformation, 
by a topology, and so on. At once highly general and highly specialized, 
the language of mathematics set out to discriminate between and classify 
all these i:mumerable spaces as precisely as possible. (Apparently the 
set of spaces, or 'space of spaces', did not lend itself very readily to 
conceptualization.) But the relationship between mathematics and reality 
- physical or social reality - was not obvious, and indeed a deep rift 
had developed between these two realms. Those mathematicians who 
had opened up this 'problematic' subsequently abandoned it to the 
philosophers, who were only too happy to seize upon it as a means of 
making up a little of the ground they had lost. In this way space became 
- or, rather, once more became - the very thing which an earlier 



PLAN Of THE PRESENT WORK 3 
philosophical tradition, namely Platonism, had proposed in opposition 
to the doctrine of categories: it became what Leonardo da Vinci had 
called a 'mental thing'. The proliferation of mathematical theories 
(topologies) thus aggravated the old 'problem of knowledge': how were 
transitions to be made from mathematical spaces (i.e. from the mental 
capacities of the human species, from logic) to nature in the first place, 
to practice in the second, and thence to the theory of social life - which 
also presumably must unfold in space? 

III 

From the tradition of thought just described - chat is, from a philosophy 
of space revised and corrected by mathematics - the modern field of 
inquiry known as epistemology has inherited and adopted the notion 
that the status of space is that of a 'mental thing' or 'mental place'. At 
the same time, set theory, as the supposed logic of that place, has 
exercised a fascination not only upon philosophers but also upon writers 
and linguists. The result has been a broad proliferation of 'sets' 
(ensembles), some practical, 1 some historical,2 but all inevitably 
accompanied by their appropriate 'logic'. None of these sets, or their 
'logics', have anything in common with Cartesian philosophy. 

No limits at all have been set on the generalization of the concept of 
mental space: no clear account of it is ever given and, depending on the 
author one happens to be reading, it may connote logical coherence, 
practical consistency, self-regulation and the relations of the parts to the 
whole, the engendering of like by like in a set of places, the logic of 
container versus contents, and so on. We are forever hearing about the 
space of this and/or the space of that: about literary space, 3 ideological 
spaces, the space of the dream, psychoanalytic topologies, and so on 
and so forth. Conspicuous by its absence from supposedly fundamental 
epistemological studies is not only the idea of 'man' but also that of space 
- the fact that 'space' is mentioned on every page notwithstanding.4 Thus 
Michel Foucault can calmly assert that 'knowledge [savoir] is also the

space in which the subject may take up a position and speak of the 
objects with which he deals in his discourse' .-� Foucault never explains 
what space it is that he is referring to, nor how it bridges the gap 
between the theoretical (epistemologica l )  rea lm and the practical one, 
between mental and socia l ,  between the space of the phi losophers and 
the space of people who deal with material things . The scientific attitude, 
understood as the appl ication of 'epistemologica l '  thinking to acquired 
knowledge, is  assumed to be 'structural ly '  l inked to the spatial sphere. 
This connection, presumed to be sel f-evident from the point of view of 
scientific discourse, is never conceptualized. Bl ithely indifferent to the 
charge of circular thinking, that discourse sets up an opposition between 
the status of space and the status of the 'subject', between the thinking 
' I '  and the object thought about. It thus rejoins the positions of the 
Cartesian/Western Logos, which some of its exponents indeed claim to 
have 'closed' .  6 Epistemological thought, in  concert with the l inguists' 
theoretical efforts, has reached a curious conclusion . It has el iminated 
the 'collective subject', the people as creator of a particular language, 
as carrier of specific etymological sequences. It has set aside the concrete 
subject, that subject which took over from a name-giving god. It has 
promoted the impersonal pronoun 'one' as creator of language in gen­
eral ,  as creator of the system. It has failed, however, to el iminate the 
need for a subject of some kind. Hence the re-emergence of the abstract 
subject, the cogito of the phi losophers . Hence the new lease on l ife of 
traditional phi losophy in 'neo-' forms: neo-Hegelian, neo-Kantian, neo­
Cartes ian .  This revival has profited much from the help of Husserl , 
whose none-too-scrupulous postulation of a (quasi-tautologous) identity 
of knowing Subject and conceived Essence - an identity inherent to a 
'flux' (of l ived experience) - underpins an almost 'pure'  identity of 
formal and practical knowledge.7 Nor should we be surprised to find 
the eminent l inguist Noam Chomsky reinstating the Cartesian cogito or 
subject,8 especial ly i n  view of the fact that he has posi ted the existence

of a l i nguistic level at which ' i t  wil l  not be the case that each sentence 
is represented simply as a finite sequence of elements of some sort, 
generated from left to right by some simple device ' ;  instead, argues 
Chomsky, we should expect to find 'a finite set of levels ordered from 
h igh to low'.9 The fact is that Chomsky unhesitatingly postu lates a 
mental space endowed with speci fic properties - with orientations and 
symmetries. He completely ignores the yawning gap that separates this 
l inguistic mental space from that socia l  space wherein language becomes 
practice. S imi larly, J. M.  Rey writes that 'Meaning presents itself as the 
legal authority to interchange signified elements a long a single horizontal 
chain,  within the confines [l'espace] of a coherent system regulated and 
ca lcu lated in advance. '10 These authors, and many others, for a l l  that 
they lay claim to absolute logical rigour, commit what is in fact, from 
the logico-mathematical point of view, the perfect paralogism:  they leap 
over an entire area, ignoring the need for any logical l inks, and justify 
this in the vaguest possible manner by invoking, as the need arises, some 
such notion as coupure or rupture or break. They thus interrupt the 
continui ty of their argument in the name of a discontinuity which their 
own methodology ought logical ly to proh ibit . The width of the gap 
created in this way, and the extent of its impact, may of course vary 
from one author to another, or from one area of special ization to 
another. My criticism certainly applies in fu l l  force, however, to Julia 
Kristeva's O'TjµELw'TLKi], to Jacques Derrida's 'grammatology' ,  and to 
Roland Barthes's general semiology.11 This school, whose growing 
renown may have something to do with its growing dogmatism, is 
forever promoting the basic sophistry whereby the philosophico­
epistemological notion of space is fetishized and the mental realm comes 
to envelop the social and physical ones. Al though a few of these authors 
suspect the existence of, or the need of, some mediation, 12 most of them 

•Noa m Chomsky, Syntactic Structures (The Hague: Mouton, 1957) ,  pp. 24-5.

11 And it extends to others, whether on their own accounr or via those mentioned here. 

Thus Barthes on Jacques Lacan: 'His topology does not concern within and without, even 
less above and below; it concerns, rather, a reverse and an obverse in constant motion -
a front and back forever changing places as they revolve around something which is in 
the process of transformation, and which indeed, ro begin with, is not' - Critique et veriti 
(Paris: Seui l ,  1 966) ,  p. 27. 

11 This is certainly not true of Claude Le,·i-Strauss, the whole of whose work implies 
that from the earliest manifestations of social life mental and social were conflated bv 
virtue of the nomenclarnre of the relationships of exchange. By contrast, when Derrid� 
gives precedence to the 'graphic' over the 'phonic', to writing over speech, or when 
Kristeva brings the body to the fore, dearly some search is being made for a transition 
or articulation between, on the one hand, the mental space prev iously posired ( i .e. 
presupposed) by these authors, and, on the other hand, physical/social space.

spring without the s l ightest hesi tation from mental to socia l .  
What is happening here i s  that  a powerful ideologica l tendency, one 

much attached to i ts own would-be scientific credentials, is expressing, 
in an admirably unconscious manner, those dominant ideas which are 
perforce the ideas of the dominant class. To some degree, perhaps, these 
ideas are deformed or diverted in the process, but the net result is  that 
a particu lar ' theoretical practice' produces a mental space which is 
apparently, but only apparently, extra-ideologica l .  In an inevitably circu­
lar manner, this mental space then becomes the locus of a 'theoretical 
practice' which is separated from social practice and which sets itsel f  
up as the axis, pivot or central reference point of Knowledge.13 The 
established 'culture' reaps a double benefit from this manoeuvre: in the 
first p lace, the impression is given that the truth is tolerated, or even 
promoted, by that 'culture'; secondly, a multitude of smal l  events occur 
within th is menta l  space which can be exploited for useful or polemical 
ends. I shall return later to the pecul iar kinship between this mental 
space and the one inhabited by the technocrats in their silent offices.14 
As for Knowledge thus defined on the basis of epistemology, and more 
or less clearly distinguished from ideology or from evolving science, is 
it not directly descended from the union between the Hegelian Concept 
and that scion of the great Cartesian family known as Subjectivity? 

The quasi- logical presupposition of an identity between mental space 
(the space of the phi losophers and epistemologists) and real space creates 
an abyss between the mental sphere on one side and the physical and 
social spheres on the other. From time to time some intrepid funambulist 
wil l  set off to cross the void, giving a great show and sending a delightful 
shudder through the onlookers. By and large, however, so-called philo­
sophical th inking recoils at the mere suggestion of any such salto mort­
ale. If they sti l l  see the abyss at al l ,  the professional philosophers avert 
their gaze. No matter how relevant, the problem of knowledge and the 
'theory of knowledge' have been abandoned in favour of a reductionistic 
return to an absolute - or supposedly absolute - knowledge, namely 
the knowledge of the history of philosophy and the history of science . 
Such a knowledge can only be conceived of as separate from both 
ideology and non-knowledge ( i .e .  from l ived experience). Although any 
separation of that kind is in fact impossible, to evoke one poses no 
threat to - and indeed tends to reinforce - a banal 'consensus' .  After

Epistemologico-philosophical thinking has failed to furnish the basis for 
a science which has been struggl ing to emerge for a very long time, as 
witness an immense accumulation of resea rch and publ ication.  That 
science is - or would be - a science of space. To date, work in this area 
has produced either mere descriptions which never achieve analytical, 
much less theoretical, status, or else fragments and cross-sections of 
space. There are plenty of reasons for thinking that descriptions and 
cross-sections of this kind, though they may well supply inventories of 
what exists in space, or even generate a discourse on space, cannot ever 
give rise to a knowledge of space. And, without such a knowledge, we 
are bound to transfer onto the level of discourse, of language per se -
i .e .  the level of mental space - a large portion of the attributes and 
'properties' of what is actual ly social space. 

Semiology raises d ifficult questions precisely because i t  is an incom­
plete body of knowledge which is expanding without any sense of its 
own l imitations; its vert dynamism creates a need for such l imits to be 
sec, as difficult as that may be. When codes worked up from l i terary 
texts are applied to spaces - to urban spaces, say - we remain, as may 
easily be shown, on the purely descriptive level. Any attempt to use such 
codes as a means of deciphering socia l space muse surely reduce that 
space itself to the status of a message, and the inhabiting of i t  to the 
status of a reading. This is  to evade both history and practice. Yet did 
there not at one time, between the sixteenth century (the Renaissance -
and the Renaissance city )  and the n ineteenth century, exist a code 
at once archi tectural, u rbanistic and political, constituting a language 
common to country people and townspeople, to the authori ties and to 
artists - a code which a l lowed space not only to be ' read' hut alsQ.tO 

_he...co.oscructed ? I f  indeed there was such a code, how did it come into 
being? And when, how and why did it disappear?  These are al l questions 
that I hope to answer in what follows. 

As for the above-mentioned sections and fragments, they range from 
the ill -defined to the undefined - and thence, for that matter, to the 
undefinable. Indeed, talk of cross-sectioning, suggesting as it does a 
scientific technique (or 'theoretical practice' )  designed to help clarify

and distinguish 'elements' with in the chaotic flux of phenomena, merely 
adds to the muddle. Leaving aside for the moment the application 
of mathematical topologies to other realms, consider how fond the 
cognoscenti are of talk of pictural space, Picasso's space, the space of 
Les demoiselles d'Avignon or the space of Guernica. Elsewhere we are 
forever hearing of arch itectural, plastic or l i terary 'spaces'; the term is 
used much as one might speak of a particular writer's or artist's 'world' 
Specia l ized works keep their audience abreast of all sorts of equal ly 
specia l ized spaces: leisure, work, play, transportation, public faci l ities -
a l l  are spoken of in spatial terms .15 Even illness and madnes� 
supposed by some special i sts to have their own pecul i'!!>P��<;:� We are 
thus confronted by an indefinite iiiuttitude or·s�, each one prred 
upon, or perhaps contained witfiin�-die next:geogfilP'liical, economic, 
demographic, sociological , ecological, political, commercial , nationa l ,  
continenta l, global .  Not to mention natu re's (physica l )  space, the space 
of (energy) flows, and so on. 

Before any specific and deta i led attempt is made to refute one or 
other of these approaches, a long with whatever claim it may have to 
scientific status, it shou ld be pointed out that the very multipl icity of 
these descriptions and sectionings makes them suspect. The fact is that 
al l these efforts exemplify a very strong - perhaps even the dominant -
tendency within present-day society and i ts mode of production. Under 
this mode of production, intellectual labour, like material labour, is \ subject to endless division. In addition, spatial practice consists in a 
projection onto a (spatial) field of al l  aspects, elements and moments of 
socia l  practice. In the process these are separated from one another, 
though th is does not mean that overa ll control is rel inquished even for 
a moment: society as a whole continues in subjection to political practice 
- that is, to state power. This praxis impl ies and aggravates more than 
one contradiction, and I shal l  be deal ing with them later. Suffice i t  to 
say at this juncture that if my analysis turns out to be correct it wi l l  be 
possible to claim of the sought-for ·� that

'neocapitalist' ) use of knowledge. Remember that knowledge 
under this system is integrated in a more or less ' immediate'

same facility as their French-speaking counterparts use the word espace, but they do have 
a corresponding fondness for such spatial terms as 'sector' and 'sphere' - Translator.I 



PLAN OF THE PRESENT WORK 9 
way into the forces of production, and in a 'mediate' way into 
the social relations of production. 

2 it impl ies an ideology designed to concea l that use, along with 
the conflicts intrinsic to the highly interested employment of a 
supposedly disinterested knowledge. This ideology carries no 
flag, and for those who accept the practice of which it is a part 
it is indistinguishable from knowledge. 

3 it embodies at best a technological utopia, a sort of computer 
simulation of the future, or of the possible, within the frame­
work of the rea l - the framework of the existing mode of 
production. The starting-point here is a knowledge which is at 
once integrated into, and integrative with respect to, the mode 
of production. The technological utopia in question is a common 
feature not just of many science-fiction novels, but also of 
al l  kinds of projects concerned with space, be they those of 
architecture, urbanism or social planning. 

The above propositions need, of course, to be expounded, supported by 
logical arguments and shown to be true. But, if they can indeed be 
verified, it wi l l  be in the first place because there is a truth of space, 
an overa l l  truth generated by analysis-followed-by-exposition, and not 
because a true space can be constituted or constructed, whether a genera l 
space as the epistemologists and phi losophers believe, or a particular 
one as proposed by special ists in some scientific discipline or other 
which has a concern with space. In the second place, confirmation of 
these theses wi l l  imply the necessity of reversing the dominant trend 
towards fragmentation, separation and disintegration, a trend subordi­
nated to a centre or to a central ized power and advanced by a knowledge 
which works as power's proxy. Such a reversal could not be effected 
without great difficul ty ;  nor would it suffice, in order to carry it through, 
to replace local or 'punctua l '  concerns by global ones. One must assume 
that it would require the mobil ization of a great many forces, and that 
in the actual course of its execution there would be a continuing need, 
stage by stage, for motivation and orientation.

Few people today would reject the idea that capital and capital ism 1 
' influence' practical matters relating to space, from the construction of 1. 
buildings to the distribution of investments and the worldwide division 1 



10 PLAN OF Tl-IE PRESENT WORK 
of labour. But it is not so clear what is meant exactly by 'capi tal ism' 
and ' influence ' .  What some have in mind is 'money' and its powers of 
intervention, or commercial exchange, the commodity and its generaliz­
ation, in that 'everything' can be bought and sold. Others are concerned 
rather with the actors in these dramas: companies national and multi­
national, banks, financiers, government agencies, and so on. In either 
case both the un i ty and the diversity - and hence the contradictions -
of capital ism are put in brackets. It is seen either as a mere aggregate 
of separate activities or else as an already constituted and closed system 
which derives its coherence from the fact that it endures - and solely 
from that fact .  Actual ly capitalism has many facets : landed capital, 
commercial capital, finance capital - all play a part in practice according 
to their varying capabi l i ties, and as opportunity affords; conflicts 
between capitalists of the same kind, or of di fferent kinds, are an 
inevitable part of the process . These diverse breeds of capital, and of 
capita l ists, along with a variety of overlapping markets - commodities, 
labour, knowledge, capital itself, land - are whac together constitute 
capital ism. 

Many people are incl ined to forget that capital ism has yec another 
aspect, one which is certa in ly bound up with the functioning of money, 
with the various markets, and with the social relations of production, 
but which is distinct from these precisely because it is dominant. This 

1aspect is the hegemony of one class . The concept of hegemony was 
\introduced by �ramsci in order to describe the future role of the working 
class in the bui lding o"f a new society, but it i s  a lso usefu l  for an<!_lysing 
the action of the bourgeoisie, especially in relation to space. The notion 
is- a refinemenCOf ·111e--somewhat cruder· concept of the 'd ictatorship'

more than an influence, more even than the permanent use of repressive 
violence. I t  is exercised over society as a whole, culture and knowledge 
included, and generally via human mediation : pol icies, political leaders, 
parties, as also a good many intellectua ls  and experts. It is exercised., 
therefore, over both institutions and.ideas. The rul ing class seeks to 
maintain its hegemony by al l avai lable means, and knowledge is one 
such means. The connection between knowledge (savoir) and power is 
thus made man i fest, although th is  in no way interdicts a critical and 
subversive form of knowledge (connaissance); on the contrary, it points 
up the antagonism between a knowledge wh ich serves power and a form

thinkers osci l late between loud denunciations of capita l ism and the 
bourgeoisie and their repressive institutions on the one hand, and fasci­
nation and unrestrained admiration on the other. They make society 
into the 'object' of a systematization which must be 'closed' to be 
complete ; they thus bestow a cohesiveness it utterly lacks upon a tota l ity 
which is in fact decidedly open - so open, indeed, that it must rely on 
violence to  endure. The position of these systematizers is in any case 
sel f-contradictory : even if their claims had some validity they would be 
reduced to nonsense by the fact that the terms and concepts used to 
define the system must necessarily be mere tools of that system itsel f.

The theory we need, which fai ls  to come together because the necessary '

Eng. tr. , p.  1 85 ) ,  and  on the basis of chronology or 'distri bution in  time' (Fr. edn, p. 244; 
Eng. tr., p. 187) .  [The savoirlconnaissance distinction cannot be conven iently expressed

temological space, the space of social practice, the space occupied by 
sensory phenomena, including products of the imagination such as 
projects and projections, symbols and utopias. 

The need for unity may be expressed in  other ways too, ways that 
serve to underscore its importance. Reflection sometimes conflates and 
sometimes draws distinctions between those ' levels' which social practice 
establ ishes, in the process raising the question of their interrelationships. 
Thus housing, habitation - the human 'habitat', so to speak - are the 
concern of architecture. Towns, cities - urban space - are the bai liwick 
of  the discipline of urbanism. As for larger, territorial spaces, regional ,  
nat ional ,  continental or worldwide, these are the responsibi l ity of plan­
ners and economists. At t imes these 'spe\:_ia l izations' are telescoped into 
one another under the auspices of that privi leged actor, the politician .  
At other times their  respective domains fai l  to overlap at a l l ,  so that 
nt!ither common projects nor theoretical continuity are possible. 

This state of affairs, of  which the foregoing remarks do not claim to 
be a ful l  critical analysis, would be brought to an end if a truly unitary 
theory were to be developed. 

Our knowledge of the material world is based on concepts defined in 
terms of  the broadest general ity and the greatest scientific ( i .e .  having 
a content) abstraction. Even if the l inks between these concepts and 
the physical real ities to which they correspond are not always clearly 
establ ished, we do know that such l inks exist, and that the concepts or 
theories they imply - energy, space, time - can be neither conflated nor 
separated from one another. What common parlance refers to as 'mat­
ter' , 'nature' or 'physical reality' - that real i ty with in which even the 
crudest analysis must discern and separate di fferent moments - has thus 
obvious ly achieved a certain unity. The 'substance' (to use the old 
vocabulary of phi losophy) of this cosmos or 'world' ,  to which humanity 
with i ts consciousness belongs, has properties that can be adequately 
summed up by means of the three terms mentioned above. When we 
evoke 'energy' ,  we must immediately note that energy has to be deployed 
with in a space. When we evoke 'space', we must immediately indicate 
what occupies that space and how it does so: the deployment of energy 
in relation to 'points' and within a time frame. When we evoke 't ime' ,  
we must immediately say what it i s  that moves or changes therein.� 
�idered in isolation is an empty abstracti�; l ikewise energy and 
time. Although in one sense th i s  'substance' is hard to conceive of, most 
of all at the cosmic leve l ,  i t  is also true to say that evidence of its 
existence stares us in  the face : our senses and our thoughts apprehend 
nothing else. 



PLAN OF THE PRESENT WORK 1 3  

Might i t  not b e  possi ble, then, t o  found our knowledge o f  socia l  
practice, and the  general science of so-cal led human real ity, on a model 
borrowed from physics ? Unfortunately not. For one thing, this kind of 
approach has a lways fa i led in the past.17 Secondly, following the physical 
model would prevent a theory of societies from using a number of 
useful procedures, notably the separation of levels, domains and regions. 
Physical theory's search for unity puts al l  the emphasis on the bringing­
together of disparate elements .  It might therefore serve as a guardrai l ,  
but never as a paradigm. 

The search for a unitar theor in ithi.ti.. 
-now e g ltse ' and controversy and polemics are inevitable. This 
goes or p ysics, and mathematics too, for that matter; sciences that 
phi losophers deem 'pure' precisely because they have purged them of 
dia lectical moments are not thereby immunized against internal conflicts. 

It seems to be well establ ished that physical space has no 'real ity' 
without t'.te energy that is deployed within it . The modal ities of this 
deployment, however, a long with the physical relationsh ips between 
central points, nuclei or  condensations on the one hand and peripheries 
on the other a re sti l l  matters for conjecture. A simple expanding-universe 
theory assumes an original dense core of matter and a primordial 
explosion. This notion of an origina l  unity of the cosmos has given rise 
to many objections by reason of its quasi-theological or theogonic 
character. In opposition to it , Fred Hoyle has proposed a much more 
complex theory, according to which energy, whether at the level of the 
ultra-small or  at that of the u l tra- large, travels in every direction. On 
this view a single centre of the universe, whether original or fina l ,  is 
inconceivable. Energy/space-time condenses at an indefinite number of 
points ( local space-times).18 

To the extent that the theory of supposedly human space can be 
l inked at al l to a physical theory ,  perhaps Hoyle's is the one which best 
fits the bill. Hoyle looks upon space as the product of energy. Energy 
cannot therefore be compared to a content fil l ing an empty container. 
Causa l ism and teleology, inevitably shot through with metaphysical 
abstraction, are both ruled out. The universe is seen as offering a 
multipl icity of particular spaces, yet this diversi ty is accounted for by a 
un itary theory, namely cosmology .  

This analogy ha s  its l imits, however. TheFe is no reason to  assume an

isomorphism between social energies and physical energies, or between 
'human'  and physical fields of force. Th is is one form of reductionism 
among others which I shal l  have occasion explicitly to reject. All the 
same, human societies, like living organisms human or extra-human, 
cannot be conceived of independently of the un iverse (or of the 'world' ) ; 
nor may cosmology, which cannot annex knowledge of those societies, 
leave them out of  its picture al together, like a state within the state.

What term should be used to describe the division which keeps the 
various types of  space away from each other, so that physical space, 
mental space and socia l  space do not overlap ?  Distortion ? Dis junction ?

What should "be 
·ti1e starting-point for any theoretical attempt to 

account for th is situation and transcend it in the process ?  Not philos­
ophy, certa inly, for ph ilosophy is an active and interested party in the 
matter. Phi losophers h ave themselves helped bring about the schism 
with which we are concerned by developing abstract (metaphysica l )  
representations of space, among them the Cartesian notion of space as 
absolute, infinite res extensa, a divine property which may be grasped 
in a single act of intu ition because of its homogeneous ( isotropic) 
character .  Th is is all the more regrettable in view of the fact that the 
beginn ings of phi losophy were closely bound up with the ' rea l '  space 
of the Greek city. This connection was severed later in phi losophy's 
development. Not that we can have no recourse to phi losophy, to its 
concepts or conceptions. But it cannot be our point of departure. What 
about l i terature? Clearly l i terary authors have written much of  rel evance, 
especia l ly descriptions of places and sites. But what criteria would make 
certa in texts more relevant than others ? Celine uses everyday language 
to great effect to evoke the space of  Paris, of the Parisian banlieue, or 
of Africa . Plato, in  the Critias and elsewhere, offers marvel lous descrip­
tions of  cosmic space, and of the space of the city as a reflection of the 
Cosmos. The inspired De Quincey pursuing the shadow of the woman 
of his dreams through the streets of  London, or Baudela ire in  his 
Tableaux parisiens, offer us accounts of urban space rivalling those of

Victor Hugo and Lautreamont. The problem is  that any search for space 
in l i terary texts wil l  find it everywhere and in every guise: enclosed, 
described, proj ected, dreamt of, speculated about. What texts can be 
considered special enough to provide the basis for a ' textua l '  analysis ? 
Inasmuch as they deal with socia l ly 'rea l '  space, one might suppose on 
first consideration that arch itecture and texts relating to archi tecture 
would be a better choice than l i terary texts proper. Unfortunately, any 
definition of arch itecture i tsel f requires a prior analysis and exposition 
of the concept of space. 

Another possibi l i ty would be to take general scientific notions as a ; 
basis, notions as general as that of text, l ike those of information and J 
communication, of message and code, and of sets of signs - a l l  notions / 
which are sti l l  being developed. The danger here is that the ana lysis of/ 
space might become enclosed within a single area of specia l ization/ 
which, so far from helping us account for the dissociations mentioned 
above, would merely exacerbate them . This leaves only universal 
notions, which seemingly belong to phi losophy but not to any particul ar\ 
special ization. Do such notions exist ? Does what Hegel cal led the con­
crete universa l sti l l  have any meaning? I hope to show that i t  does. 
What can be said without further ado is that the concepts of production ·r 
and of the act of producing do have a certain  abstract universality. ) 
Though developed by phi losophers, these concepts extend beyond phil­
osophy .  They were taken over in the past, admittedly, by specia l ized 
discipl ines, especia l ly by polit ical economy; yet they have surv ived that 
annexation .  By retrieving someth ing of the broad sense that they had 
in certain of Marx's writings, they have shed a good deal of  the i l lusory 
precision with which the economists had endowed them. This is not to 
say that it wil l  be easy to recover these concepts and put them back to 
work. To speak of 'producing space' sounds bizarre, so great is the sway 
still held by the idea that empty space is pnor to whatever ends up 
fill ing it . Questions immediately arise here :  what spaces? and what does 
i t  mean to speak of  'producing space' ? We are confronted by the problem 
of how to bring concepts that have already been worked out and 
formal ized into conjunction with this new content without fal l ing back 
on mere i l lustration and example - notorious occasions for sophistry. 
What is called for, therefore, i s  a thoroughgoing exposition of these 
concepts, and of their relations, on the one hand with the extreme 
formal abstraction of logico-mathematical space, and on the other h and 
with the practico-sensory rea lm of socia l  space. To proceed otherwise 
would result in a new fragmentation of the concrete universal i nto its 
original  Hegel ian moments : the particular (in this case descriptions or 



1 6  PLAN O F  THE PRESENT WORK 

cross-sections of social space); the general (logical and mathematical); 
and the singular (i.e. 'places' considered as natural, in their merely 
physical or sensory reality). 

VIII 

Everyone knows what is meant when we speak of a 'room' in an 
apartment, the 'corner' of the street, a 'marketplace', a shopping or 
cultural 'centre', a public 'place', and so on. These terms of everyday 
discourse serve to distinguish, but not to isolate, particular spaces, and 
in general to describe a social space. They correspond to a specific use 
of that space, and hence to a spatial practice that they express and 
constitute. Their interrelationships· are ordered in a specific way. Might 
it not be a good idea, therefore, first to make an inventory of them, 19 
and then to try and ascertain what paradigm gives them their meaning, 
what syntax governs their organization? 

There are two possibilities here: either these words make up an 
unrecognized code which we can reconstitute and explain by means of 
thought; alternatively, reflection will enable us, on the basis of the 
words themselves and the operations that are performed upon them, to 
construct a spatial code. In either event, the result of our thinking would 
b� the construction of a 'system of space'. Now, we know from precise 
scientific experiments that a system of this kind is applicable only 
indirectly to its 'object', and indeed that it really only applies to a 
discourse on that object. The project I am outlining, however, does not 
aim to produce a (or the) discourse on space, but rather to expose the 
actual production of space by bringing the various kinds of space and 
the moda!ities of their genesis together within a single theory. 

These brief remarks can only hint at a solution to a problem that we 
shall have to examine carefully later on in order to determine whether 
it is a bona fide issue or merely the expression of an obscure question 
about origins. This problem is: does language - logically, epistemologi­
cally or genetically speaking - precede, accompany or follow social 
space? Is it a precondition of social space or merely a formulation of 
it? The priority-of-language thesis has certainly not been established. 
Indeed, a good case can be made for according logical and epistemologi­
cal precedence over highly articulated languages with strict rules to those 

1• Cf. Georges Matore, L'espace h11111ain (Paris: La Colombe, 1 962),  including the 
lexicographical index. 



PLAN OF THE PRESENT W O R K  1 7  

activities which mark the earth, leaving traces and organizing gestures 
and work performed in common. Perhaps what have to be uncovered 
are as-yet concealed relations between space and language: perhaps the 
'logicalness' intrinsic to articulated language operated from the start as 
a spatiality capable of bringing order to the qualitative chaos (the 
practico-sensory realm) presented by the perception of things. 

To what extent may a space be read or decoded? A satisfactory 
answer to this question is certainly not just around the corner. As I 
noted earlier, without as yet adducing supporting arguments or proof, 
the notions of message, code, information and so on cannot help us 
trace the genesis of a space; the fact remains, however, that an already 
produced space can be decoded, can be read. Such a space implies a 
process of signification. And even if there is no general code of space, 
inherent to language or to all languages, there may have existed specific 
codes, established at specific historical periods and varying in their 
effects. If so, interested 'subjects', as members of a particular society, 
would have acceded by this means at once to their space and to their 
status as 'subjects' acting within that space and (in the broadest sense 
of the word) comprehending it. 

If, roughly from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth, a coded 
language may be said to have existed on the practical basis of a specific 
relationship between town, country and political territory, a language 
founded on classical perspective and Euclidean space, why and how did 
this coded system collapse ? Should an attempt be made to reconstruct 
that language, which was common to the various groups making up the l 
society - to users and inhabitants, to the authorities and to the tech­
nicians (architects, urbanists, planners) ? 

A theory can only take form, and be formulated, at the level of a 
'supercode'. Knowledge cannot rightly be assimilated to a 'well-designed' 
language, because it operates at the conceptual level. It is thus not a 
privileged language, nor a metalanguage, even if these notions may be 
appropriate for the 'science of language' as such. Knowledge of space 
cannot be limited from the outset by categories of this kind. Are we 
looking, then, for a 'code of codes'? Perhaps so, but this 'meta ' function 
of theory does not in itself explain a great deal. If indeed spatial codes 
have existed, each characterizing a particular spatial/social practice, 
and if these codifications have been produced along with the space 
corresponding - totllem� then the job of theory is to elucidate their 
rise, their role, and their demise. The shift I am proposing in analytic 
orientation relative to the work of specialists in this area ought by now 
to be clear :  instead of emphasizing the rigorously formal aspect of codes, 



1 8  PLAN OF THE PR ESENT W O R K  
I shall instead be putting the stress on their diale_c_ticaJ character. Codes 
,wil l  be seen as part of a practical relationsh ip, as part o{ �n interaction 

1 between 'subjects' and thei r space and surroundings. I shall attempt to 
trace the coming-into-being and disappearance of codings/decodings. 
My aim will be to high light contents - i .e. the social (spatial) practices 
inherent to the forms under consideration .

Surrealism appears quite otherwise today than it did ha lf a century 
ago. A number of its pretensions have faded away, among them the 
substitution of poetry for politics, the politicization of poetry and the 
search for a transcendent revelation . All the same, though a literary 
movement, it cannot be reduced to the level of mere literature (which 
surrealism initially despised), and hence to the status of a literary event, 
bound up with the exploration of the unconscious (automatic writing), 
which had a subversive character to begin with but which was sub­
sequently co-opted by every means available - glosses, exegeses, com­
mentaries, fame, publicity, and so on. 

, The leading surrealists sought to decode inner space and illuminate 
1 the nature of the transition from this subjective space to the material 
realm of the body and the outside world, and thence to social life. 
Consequently surrealism has a theoretical import which was not orig­
inally recognized. The surrealists' effort to find a unity of this kind 
initiated a search which later went astray. It is discernible, for example, 
in Andre Breton's L'amour fou, where the introduction of imaginary 
and magical elements, though perhaps strange, detracts in no way from 
the annunciatory value of the work: 

Sometimes, for example, wishing for the visit of a particular 
woman, I have found myself opening a door, then shutting it, then 
opening it aga in ;  if this device proved inadequate to the task, I 
might slip the blade of a knife randomly between the pages of a 
book, having previously decided that a certain line on the left­
hand or right-hand page would inform me more or less indirectly 
as to her inclinations and tell me whether to expect her soon or 
not at all ; then I would start moving things around once more,

scrutinizing their positions relative to each other and rearranging 
them in unusual ways.20 

1 9  

Still, the scale o f  the failure.. Rf, surrealism's poetic project should also 
be pointed out. Not that surrealist poetry lacked an accompanying 
conceptual apparatus designed to explain its orientation ; indeed, so 
numerous are the movement's theoretical texts - manifestoes and others 
- that one might well ask what would remain of surrealism were they 
left out of consideration. The intrinsic shortcomings of the poetry run 
deeper, however: it prefers the visual to the act of seeing, rarely adopts 
a 'li stening' posture, and curiously neglects the musical both in its mode 
of expression and, even more, in its central 'vision'. ' It was as though 
the deep night of human existence had suddenly been pierced', writes 
Breton,  'as though natural necessity had consented to become one 
with logical necessity and so plunged all things into a state of total 
transparency. '2 1 

As Breton himself acknowledges,22 a project of Hegelian derivation 
was to be pursued solely via an affective, and hence subjective, overbur­
dening of the (loved) 'object' by means of a hyper-exaltation of symbols. 
Thus the surrealists, proclaiming - though none too loudly and certainly 
without any supporting evidence - that the Hegelian 'end of history' 
lay within, and would be advanced by, their poetry, succeeded only in 
producing a lyrical metalanguage of history, an illusory fusing of subject 
with object in a transcendental metabolism. Their purely verbal meta­
morphosis, anamorphosis or anaphorization of the relationship between 
'subjects' (people) and things (the realm of everyday life) overloaded 
meaning - and changed nothing. There was simply no way, by virtue 
of language alone, to make the leap from exchange (of goods) to use. 

Like that of the surrealists, the work of Georges Bataille now has a 
meaning somewhat different from the one it had originally. Batai lle too 
sought (among other things) a junction between the space of inner 
experience on the one hand, and, on the other, the space of physical 
nature (below the level of consciousness: tree, sex, acephal) and social 
space (communication, speech). Like the surrealists - though not, like 
them, on the trail of an imagined synthesis - Bataille left his mark 
everywhere between real, infra-real and supra-real. His way was Nietz­
sche's - eruptive and disruptive. He accentuates divisions and widens

despite the passing of so many years, of much of Eluard's poerry.

gulfs rather than filling them, until that moment when the lightning 
flash of intuition/intention leaps from one side to the other, from earth 
to sun,  from night to day, from life to death; and likewise from the 
logical to the heterological, from the normal to the heteronomic (which 
is at once far beyond and far short of the anomic) . In Bataille the 
entirety of space - mental, physical, social - is apprehended tragically. 
To the extent that centre and periphery are distinguished, the centre has 
its own tragic reality - a reality of sacrifice, violence, explosion . So too 
has the periphery - after its fashion. 

I n  diametrical opposition to Bataille and the surrealists, though con­
temporary with them, a theorist of technology named Jacques Lafitte 
also glimpsed the possibility of a unitary theory of space. Lafitte, a 
writer too often forgotten, proposed what he called a 'mechanology' as 
a general science of technical devices and systems, and made this science 
responsible for exploring material reality, knowledge and social space. 23 
Lafitte was following up certain writings of Marx, an account of which 
has since been given by Kostas Axelos. 24 He did not have all the essential 
elements and concepts at his disposal, because he knew nothing of 
information science and cybernetics, and consequently of the distinction 
between information-based machines and machines calling for massive 
energy sources; but he did give effective form to the unitary hypothesis. 
To chis project he brought all the ' rigour' of technocracic-functionalist­
structuralist ideology; characteristically enough, this led him to the most 
outrageous propositions, and to conceptual links worthy of science 
fiction . In short, Lafitte produced a technocratic utopia. He sought, for 
example, to explain history by comparing 'passive' (and hence static) 
machines to architecture and to the vegetable kingdom, and 'active' 
machines, deemed more dynamic, more 'reflex' ,  to animals. Basing 
himself on such notions, Lafitte worked out evolutionary series occupy­
ing space, and boldly schematized the genesis of nature, of knowledge 
and of society 'via the harmonious development of these three great 
segments, series at once convergent and complementary'.25 

Lafitte's hypothesis was the forerunner of many others of a similar 
stamp. Such reflexive technocratic thinking emphasizes the explicit and 
avowed - not just the rational but also the intellectual - and completely

eschews the lateral and heterological realms which lie concealed in 
praxis ; rejected too, on the same basis , is the kind of thinking that 
uncovers what is thus concealed. It is as though everything, in the space 
of thought and in social space, could be reduced to a frontal, 'face-to­
face' mode.

I f  the search for a unitary theory of physical ,  mental and social space 
was adumbrated several decades ago, why and how was it abandoned? 
Did it cover too vast a field - a veritable chaos of ideas, some of them 
poetic, subjective or speculative, while others bore the stamp of technical 
positivity ? Or was it simply that this line of inquiry turned out to be 
sterile ? 

In order to understand exactly what happened, it is necessary to go 
back to Hegel, who is a sort of Place de l'Etoile with a monument to 
politics and philosophy at its centre. According to H.�elianism, historical 
time gives birth to that space which the state occupies and rules over. 
History does not realize the archetype of the reasonable being in the 
individual, but rather in a coherent ensemble comprised of partial insti­
tutions, groups and systems (law, morality, family, city, trade, etc. ) .  
Time is thus solidified and fixed within the rationality immanent to 
space. The Hegelian end of history does not imply the disappearance of 
the product of historicity. On the contrary, this product of a process of 
production which is animated by knowledge (the concept) and oriented 
by consciousness (language, the Logos) - this necessary product - asserts 
its own self-sufficiency. It persists in being through its own strength. 
What disappears is history, which is transformed from action to memory, 
from production to contemplation. As for time, dominated by repetition 
and circularity, overwhelmed by the establishment of an immobile space : 
which is the locus and environment of realized Reason, it loses all / 
meaning. ' 

In the wake of this feti�hization of space in the service of the state, 
philosophy and practical activity were bound to seek a restoration 
of time.26 Hence Marx's vigorous reinstatement of historical time as 
revolutionary time. Hence also Bergson's more nuanced ( though abstract 
and uncertain because specialized) evocation of mental duration and the

immediacy of consciousness; hence Husserlian phenomenology with its 
'Heraclitean' flux of phenomena and subjectivity of the ego; and hence, 
later, a whole philosophical tradition.27 

In Georg Lukacs's anti-Hegelian Hegelianism, space serves to define 
reification, as also false consciousness. Rediscovered time, under the 
direction of a cl ass consciousness elevated to the sublime level at which 
it can survey history's twists and turns at a glance, breaks the primacy 
of the spatial .  2 8  

Only Nietzsche, since Hegel, has maintained the primordiality of 
space and concerned himself with the spatial problematic - with the 
repetitiveness, the circularity, the simultaneity of that which seems 
diverse in the temporal context and which arises at different times. In 
the realm of becoming, but standing against the flux of time, every 
defined form, whether physical, mental or social, struggles to establish 
and maintain itself. Yet Nietzschean space preserves not a single feature 
of the Hegelian view of space as product and residue of historical time. 
'I believe in absolute space as the substratum of force: the latter limits 
and forms', writes Nietzsche.29 Cosmic space contains energy, contains 
forces, and proceeds from them. The same goes for terrestrial and social 
space :  'Where there is space there is being.' The relationships between 
force (energy), time and space are problematica l .  For example, one can 
neither conceive of a beginning (an origin) nor yet do without such an 
idea. As soon as that (albeit essential) a ctivity which discerns and 
marks distinctions is removed from the picture, 'The interrupted and the 
successive are concordant. ' An energy or force can only be identified by 
means of its effects in space, even if forces 'in themselves' are distinct 
from their effects (and how can any 'real i ty' - energy, space or time -
be grasped 'in itself' by intellectual analysis? ) .  Just as Nietzschean space 
has nothing in common with Hegelian space, so Nietzschean time, as 
theatre of universal tragedy, as the cyclical, repetitious space-time of 
death and of life, has nothing in common with Marxist time - that is, 
historicity driven forward by the forces of production and adequately

( to be optimistic) oriented by industrial, proletarian and revolutionary 
rationality . 

This is perhaps a convenient moment to consider what has been 
happening in the second half of the twentieth century, the period to 
which 'we' are witnesses . 

l The state is consolidating on a world sca le .  It weighs down on society 
(on all societies) in full force ; it plans and organizes society 'rational ly', 
with the help of knowledge and technology, imposing analogous, if 
not homologous, measures irrespective of politica l  ideology, historical 
background, or the class origins of those in power. The state crushes 
time by reducing differences to repetitions or circularities) dubbed 'equi­
librium', 'feedback', 'self-regulation', and so on) . Space in its Hegelian 
form comes back into its own . This modern state promotes and imposes 
itself as the stable centre - definitively - of (national) societies and 
spaces. As both the end and the meaning of history - just as Hegel had, forecast - it flattens the social and 'cul tural '  spheres. It en forces a logic 
that puts an end to conflicts and contradictions. It neutralizes whatever 
resists it by castration or crushing. Is this social entropy? Or is it a 
monstrous excrescence transformed into normal ity? Whatever the 
answer, the results lie before us .  
2 In this same space there are, however, other forces on the boil, because 
the rationality of the state, of its techniques, plans and programmes, 
provokes opposition .  The violence of power is answered by the violence 
of subversion. With its wars and revolutions, defeats and victories, 
confrontation and turbulence, the modern world corresponds precisely 
to Nietzsche's tragic vision. State-imposed normality makes permanent 
transgression inevitable. As for time and negativity, whenever they re­
emerge, as they must, they do so explosively. This is a new negativity, 
a tragic negativity which manifests itself as incessant violence. These 
seething forces are stil l capable of rattling the lid of the cauldron of the 
state and its space, for differences can never be totally quieted. Though 
defeated, they live on, and from time to time they begin fighting fer­
ociously to reassert themselves and transform themselves through strug­
gle. 

3 Nor h;Js the working class said its last word. It continues on its way, 
s6'iiletlmes u�-derg��und, sometimes in the light of day. It is not an easy 
inatter to get rid of the class struggle, which has taken myriad forms 
not accounted for by the impoverished schema usually so referred to -
a schema which is nowhere to be found in Marx even if its devotees

claim to be Marxists. It may be that a fatal balance of power has now 
been reached which will prevent the working class's opposition to the 
bourgeoisie from ever becoming an open antagonism, so that society 
totters wh ile the state rots in place or reasserts itself in convulsive 
fash ion. It may be that world revolution will break out after a period 
of latency. Or perhaps world war will circle the planet in the wake of 
the world market. At all events, everyth ing suggests at present that the 
workers in the industrialized countries are opting neither for indefinite 
growth and accumulation nor for violent revolution leading to the 
disappearance of the state, but rather for the withering away of work 
itself. Merely to consider the possibilities is to realize that Marxist 
thought has not disappeared, and indeed that it cannot disappear. 

Confrontation of the theses and hypotheses of Hegel, Marx and 
Nietzsche is just beginn ing - and only with great difficulty at that. As 
for philosophical thought and thought about space and time, it is split. 
On the one hand we have the philosophy of time, of duration, itself 
broken up into partial considerations and emphases : historical time, 
social time, mental t ime, and so on. On the other hand we have epistemo­
logical thought, which constructs an abstract space and cogitates about 
abstract (logico-mathematical) spaces. Most if not all authors ensconce 
themselves comfortably enough within the terms of mental (and there­
fore neo-Kantian or neo-Cartesian) space, thereby demonstrating that 
'theoretical practice' is already nothing more than the egocentric thinking 
of specialized Western intellectuals - and indeed may soon be nothing 
more than an entirely separated, schizoid consciousness. 

The aim of this book is to detonate this state of affairs. More specifi­
cally, apropos of space, it aims to foster confrontation between those 
ideas and propositions which illuminate the modern world even if they 
do not govern it, treating them not as isolated theses or hypotheses, as 
'thoughts' to be put under the microscope, but rather as prefigurations 
lying at the th reshold of modernity.10

This aim does not imply the elaboration of a critical theory of existing 
space designed as a substitute for the descriptions and cross-sections 
that accept that space or for other critical theories that deal with 
society in general, with political economy, with culture, and so on. The 
substitution of a negative and critical utopia of space (or of 'man' or 
'society' )  for the dominant technological utopia is no longer sufficient. 
Critical theory, after being driven into practical opposition - and even 
into the most radical form of it, whether 'punctual' (i.e. attacking 
parricu larly vulnerable points) or global - has had its day. 

It might be supposed that our first priority should be the methodical 
_i:ksnuction of the codes relating to space. Nothing could be further 
from the case, however, because the codes inherent to knowledge and 
social practice have been in dissolution for a very long time already. All 
that remains of them are relics : words, images, metaphors. This is the 
outcome of an epoch-making event so generally ignored that we have 
to be reminded of it at every moment. The fact is that around 1 9 1 0  a 
certain space was shattered. It was the space of common sense, of 
kilowledge (savoir) , of social practice, of political power, a space thi­
therto enshrined in everyday discourse, just as in abstract thought, as 
the environment of and channel for communications ; the space, too, of 
classical perspective and geometry, developed from the Renaissance 
onwards on the basis of the Greek tradition (Euclid, logic) and bodied 
forth in Western art and philosophy, as in the form of the city and 
town. Such were the shocks and onslaughts suffered by this space that 
today it retains but a feeble pedagogical reality, and then only with �reat difficulty, within a conservative educational system. Euclidean and 
petspectivist space have disappeared as systems of reference, along with 
other former 'commonplaces' such as the town, history, paternity, the 
tonal system in music, traditional morality, and so forth. This was truly 
a crucial moment. Naturally, 'common-sense' space, Euclidean space 
and perspectivist space did not disappear in a puff of smoke without 
leaving any trace in our consciousness, knowledge or educational 
methods ; they could no more have done so than elementary algebra and

arithmetic, or grammar, or Newtonian physics. The fact remains that it 
is too late for destroying codes in the name of a critical theory; our task, 
rather, is to describe their already completed destruction, to measure its 
effects, and (perhaps) to construct a new code by means of theoretical 
'supercoding'. 

It must be stressed that what is needed is not a replacement for the 
dominant tendency, however desirable that may once have been, but 
instead a reversal of that tendency. As I shall attempt at some length to 
show, even if absolute proof is impossible, such a reversal or inversion 
would consist, as in Marx's time, in a movement from products (whether 
studied in general or in particular, described or enumerated) to pro­
duction. 

This reversal of tendency and of meaning has nothing to do with the 
conversion of signified elements into signifiers, as practised under the 
banner of an intellectualizing concern for 'pure' theory. The elimination 
of the signified element, the putting-in-brackets of the 'expressive', the 
exclusive appeal to formal signifiers - these operations precede the 
reversal of tendency which leads from products to productive activity ; 
they merely simulate that reversal by reducing it to a sequence of abstract 
interventions performed upon language (and essentially upon literature).

(Social) space is a (social) product. This proposition might appe'ar to 
border on the tautologous, and hence on the obvious. There is good 
reason, however, to examine it carefully, to consider its implications 
and consequences before accepting it. Many people will find it hard to 
endorse the notion that space has taken on, within the present mode of 
production, within society as it actually is, a sort of realiry g_f_i!_s _ _ ow_n, 
a reality clearly distinct from, yet much like, those ass�ed in the same 
global process by commodities, money and capital. Many people, finding 
this claim paradoxical, will want proof. The more so in view of the 
further claim that the space thus produced also serves as a tool of 
thought and of action ; that in addition to being a means of production 
it is also a means of control, and hence _Qf domination, of p_o.wer; yet 
that, as such, ltescapes in partfrom those who wo-uld make use of it. 
The social and political (state) forces which engendered this space now 
seek, but fail, to master it completely; the very agency that has forced 
spatial reality towards a son of uncontrollable autonomy now strives 
to run it into the ground, then shackle and enslave it. Is this space an 



Pl.AN OF THE PR ESENT W O R K  27 

abstract one? Yes, but it is also 'real' in the sense in which concrete 
abstractions such as commodities and money are real. ls it then concrete ? 
Yes, though not in the sense that an object or product is concrete. Is it 
instrumental? Undoubtedly, but, like knowledge, it extends beyond 
instrumentality . Can it be reduced to a projection - to an 'objectification' 
of  knowledge? Yes and no :  knowledge objectified in a product is no 
longer coextensive with knowledge in its theoretical state. If space 
embodies social rela tionships, how and why does it do so? And what 
relationships are they? 

It is because of all these questions that a thoroughgoing analysis and 
a full overall exposition are called for. This must involve the introduction 
of new ideas - in the first place the idea of a diversity or multiplicity 
of spaces quite distinct from that multiplicity which results from seg­
menting and cross-sectioning space ad infinitum. Such new ideas must 
then be inserted into the context of what is generally known as 'history ', 
which will consequently itself emerge in a new light. 

Social space will be revealed in its particularity to the ex_�e,n.uhar_ it 
ceases to ·be ·-indistinguishable froih .. ffiehtal spa�e . fas . ddi'ned by the 
philosophersanamathem.:i.tlciai-isfon-the' o�e hand; a,ml�!cal seace 
(as defined by practico-sensory activity and the perception of 'nature' ) 
on the other. What I shall be seeking to demonstrate is that such a social 
space is constituted neither by a collection of things or an aggregate of 
(sensory) data, nor by a void packed like a parcel with various contents, 
and that it is irreducible to a 'form' imposed upon phenomena, upon 
things, upon physical materiality. If I am successful, the social character 
of space, here posited as a preliminary hypothesis, will be confirmed as 
we go along. 

XIII 

If it is true that (socia l )  space is a (social) product, how is th.is f;ic;;t 
concealed? The answer is: by a double illusion, each side of which refers 
bad( io die other, reinforces the other, and hides behind the other. 
These two aspects are the illusion of transparency on the one hand and 
the illusion of opacity, or 'realistic' illusion, on the other. 

1 The illusion of transparency Here space appears as luminous, as 
intelligible� as giving action free rein. What happens in space lends a 
miraculous ·quaT!ty to thought, which becomes incarnate by means of a 
design (in both senses of the word). The design serves as a mediator -



28 P L A N  OF THE PRESENT W O R K  

itself of great fidelity - between mental activity (invention) and social 
activity (realization); and it is deployed in space. The illusion of trans­
parency goes hand in hand with a view of space as innocent, as free of 
traps or secret places. Anything hidden or dissimulated - and hence 
dangerous - is antagonistic to transparency, under whose reign every­
thing can be taken in by a single glance from that mental eye which \' illuminates whatever it contemplates. Comprehension is thus supposed, 

, without meeting any insurmountable obstacles, to conduct what is per­
! ceived, i.e. its object, from the shadows into the light; it is supposed to 

effect this displacement of the object either by piercing it with a ray or 
by converting it, after certain precautions have been taken, from a 
murky to a luminous state. Hence a rough coincidence is assumed to 
exist between social space on the one hand and mental space - the 
(topological) space of thoughts and utterances - on the other. By what 
path, and by means of what magic, is this thought to come about? The 
presumption is that an encrypted reality becomes readily decipherable 
thanks to the intervention first of speech and then of writing. It is 
said, and believed, that this decipherment  is effected solely through 
transposition and through the illumination that such a strictly topologi­
cal change brings about. 

I What justification is there for thus claiming that within the spatial \ realm the known and the transparent are one and the same thing? The 
' fact is that this claim is a basic postulate of a diffuse ideology which 
dates back to classical philosophy. Closely bound up with Western 
'culture', this ideology stresses speech, and overemphasizes the written 
word, to the detriment of a social practice which it is indeed designed 
to conceal. The f�tishism of the spoken word, or ideology of speech, is 
reinforced by the fetishism and· ideology of writing. For some, whether 
explicitly or implicitly, speech achieves a total clarity of communication, 
flushing out whatever is obscure and either forcing it to reveal itself or 
destroying it by sheer force of anathema .  Others feel that speech alone 
does not suffice, and that the test and action of the written word, as 
agent of both malediction and sanctification, must also be brought into 
play. The act of writing is supposed, beyond its immediate effects, to 
imply a discipline that facilitates the grasping of the 'object' by the 
writing and speaking 'subject' .  In any event, the spoken and written 
word are taken for (social) practice; it is assumed that absurdity and 
obscurity, which are treated as aspects of the same thing, may be 
dissipated without any corresponding disappearance of the 'object ' .  Thus 
communication brings the non-communicated into the realm of the 
communicated - the incommunicable having no existence beyond that 



PLAN OF TH E PRESENT WORK 29 

of an ever-pursued residue. Such are the assumptions of an ideology 
which, in positing the transparency of space, identifies knowledge, infor­
mation and communication. It was on the basis of this ideology that 
people believed for quite a time that a revolutionary social transform­
ation could be brought about by means of communication alone. 'Every­
thing must be said ! No time limit on speech ! Everything must be written! 
Writing transforms language, therefore writing transforms society! Writ­
ing is a signifying practice ! '  Such agendas succeed only in conflating 
revolution and transparency. 

The illusion of transparency turns out {to revert for a moment to the 
old terminology of the philosophers) to be a transcendental illusion: a 
trap, operating on the basis of its own quasi-magical power, but by the 
same token referring back immediately to other traps - traps which are 
its alibis, its masks. 

2 The realistic illusion This is the illusion of natural simplicity - the 
product of a naive attitude long ago rejected by philosophers and 
theorists of language, on various grounds and under various names, but 
chiefly because of its appeal to naturalness, to substantiality. According 
to the philosophers of the good old idealist school, the credulity peculiar 
to common sense leads to the mistaken belief that 'things' have more 
of an existence than the 'subject', his tho�ght and his desires. To reject 
this illusion thus implies an adherence to 'pure' thought, to Mind or 
Desire. Which amounts to abandoning the realistic illusion only to fall 
back into the embrace of the illusion of transparency. 

Among linguists, semanticists and semiologists one encounters a pri­
mary (and indeed an ultimate) na·ivety which asserts that language, 
rather than being defined by its form, enjoys a 'substantial reality'. On 
this view language resembles a 'bag of words' from which the proper 
and adequate word for each thing or 'object' may be picked. In the 
course of any reading, the imaginary and the symbolic dimensions, the 
landscape and the horizon which line the reader's path, are all taken as 
'real', because the true characteristics of the text - its signifying form 
as much as its symbolic content - are a blank page to the naif in his 
unconsciousness. (It is worth noting en passant that his illusions provide 
the naif with pleasures which knowledge is bound to abolish along with 
those illusions themselves. Science, moreover, though it may replace the 
innocent delights of naturalness with more refined and sophisticated 
pleasures, can in no wise guarantee that these will be any more 
delectable.) 



30 PLAN OF THE PRESENT WORK 
The illusion of substantiality, nanualness and spatial opacity nurtures 

its own mythology. One thinks of the space-oriented artist, at work in 
a hard or dense reality delivered direct from the domain of Mother 
Nature. More likely a sculptor than a painter, an architect sooner than 
a musician or poet, such an artist tends to work with materials that 
resist or evade his efforts. When space is not being overseen by the 
geometer, it is liable to take on the physical qualities and properties of 
the earth. 

The illusion of transparency has a kinship with philosophical idealism; 
the realistic illusion is closer to (naturalistic and mechanistic) material­
ism. Yet these two illusions do not enter into antagonism with each other 
after the fashion of philosophical systems, which armour themselves like 
battleships and seek to destroy one another. On the contrary, each 
illusion embodies and nourishes the other. The shifting back and forth 
between the two, and the flickering or oscillatory effect that it produces, 
are thus j ust as important as either of the illusions considered in isolation. 
Symbolisms deriving from nature can obscure the rational lucidity which 
the West has inherited from its history and from its successful domi­
nation of nature. The apparent translucency taken on by obscure histori­
cal and political forces in decline (the state, nationalism) can enlist 
images having their source in the earth or in nature, in paternity or in 
maternity. The rational is thus naturalized, while nature cloaks itself in 
nostalgias which supplant rationality. 

XIV 

As a programmatic foretaste of the t�c:_:;_ I shall be dealing with later, 
I shall now review some of the implications and consequences of our 
initial proposition - namely, that (social) space is a (social) product. 

The first implication is that (physical) natural space is _di_sappearing. 
Granted, natural space was - and it remains - the common point of 
depa_rture: the origin, and the original model , of the social process -
perhaps even the basis of all 'originality'. Granted, too, that natural 
space has not vanished purely and simply from the scene. It is still the 
background of the picture; as decor, and more than decor, it persists 
everywhere, and every natural detail, every natural object is valued even 
more as it takes on symbolic weight (the most insignificant animal, trees, 
grass, and so on). As source and as resource, nature obsesses us, as do 
childhood and spontaneity, via the filter of memory. Everyone wants to 
protect and save nature; nobody wants to stand in the way of an attempt 



PLAN OF THE PRESENT WORK 3 1  

to retrieve its authenticity. Yet at the same time everything conspires to 
harm it. The fact is that natural space will soon be lost to view. Anyone 
so inclined may look over their shoulder and see it sinking below the 
horizon behind us. Nature is also becoming lost to thought. For what 
is nature? How can we form a picture of it as it was before the 
intervention of humans with their ravaging tools? Even the powerful 
myth of nature is being transformed into a mere fiction, a negative 
utopia: nature is now seen as merely the raw material out of which the 
productive forces of a variety of social systems have forged their particu­
lar spaces. True, nature is res i stant, and infinite in its depth, but it 
has been defeated, and now waits only for its ultimate voidance and 
destruction. 

xv 

A second implication is that every society - and hence every mode of 
production with its subvariants (i.e. all those societies which exemplify 
the general concept - produces a space, its own space. The city of the 
ancient world cannot be understood as a collection of people and things 
in space; nor can it be visualized solely on the basis of a number of 
texts and treatises on the subject of space, even though some of these, 
as for example Plato's Critias and Timaeus or Aristotle's Metaphysics 
A, may be irreplaceable sources of knowledge. For the ancient city had 
its own spatial practice: it forged its own - appropriated - space. 
Whence the need for a study of that space which is able to apprehend 
it as such, in its genesis and its form, with its own specific time or times 
(the rhythm of daily life), and its particular centres and polycentrism 
(agora, temple, stadium, etc. ) . 

The Greek city is cited here only as an example - as one step along 
the way. Schematically speaking, each society offers up its own peculiar 
space, as it were, as an 'object' for analysis and overall theoretical 
explication. I say each society, but it would be more accurate . .to say 
e�g.<;!_e__9f production, along with its .�ec_ific . rc;:latio1�s of prodµqiqn; 
any such mode of production may subsume significant variant forms, 
and this makes for a number of theoretical difficulties, many of which 
we shall run into later in the shape of inconsistencies, gaps and blanks 
in our general picture. How much can we really learn, for instance, 
confined as we are to Western conceptual tools, about the Asiatic mode 
of production, its space, its towns, or the relationship it embodies 



32  PLA N O F  TH E PRESENT W O R K  

between town and country - a relationship reputedly represented figu­
ratively or ideographically by the Chinese characters? 

More generally, the very notion of social space resists analysis because 
of its novelty and because of the real and formal complexity that it 
connotes. Social space contains - and assigns (more or less) appropriate 
places to - ( 1 )  the socialrelations of reproduction, i.e. the bio-physiologi­
cal relations between the sexes and between age groups, along with the 
specific organization of the family ; and (2 )  the relations of production, 
i .e. the division of labour and its organization in the form of hierarchical 
social functions. These two sets of relations, production and repro­
duction, are inextricably bound up with one another: the division of 
labour has repercussions upon the family and is of a piece with it; 
conversely, the organization of the family interferes with the div ision of 
labour. Yet social space must discriminate between the two - not always 
successfully, be it said - in order to 'localize' them. 

To refine this scheme somewhat, it should be pointed out that in 
precapitalist societies the two interlocking levels of biological repro­
duction and socio-economic production together constituted social 
reproduction - that is to say, the reproduction of society as it perpetuated 
i tself generation after generation, conflict, feud, strife, crisis and war 
notwithstanding. That a decisive part is played by space in this continuity 
is something I shall be attempting to demonstrate below. 

The advent of capitalism, and more particularly 'modern' neocapi­
talism, has rendered this state of affairs considerably more complex. 
Here three interrelated levels must be taken into account: ( 1) biological 
reproduction (the family) ;  (2) the reproduction of labour power (the 
working class per se) ; and ( 3 )  the reproduction of the social relations 
of production - that is, of those relations which are constitutive of 
capitalism and which are increasingly (and increasingly effectively) 
sought and imposed as such. The role of space in this tripartite ordering 
of things will need to be examined in its specificity. 

To make things even more complicated, social space also contains 
specific representations of this double or triple interaction between the 
social relations of production and reproduction. Symbolic representation 
serves to maintain these social relations in a state of coexistence and 
cohesion. It displays them while displacing them - and thus concealing 
them in symbolic fashion - with the help of, ano onto the backdrop 
of, nature. Representations of the relations of reproduction are sexual 
symbols, symbols of male and female, sometimes accompanied, some­
times not, by symbols of age - of youth and of old age. This is a 
symbolism which conceals more than it reveals, the more so since the 



PLAN OF TH E !'R ESENT W O R K  33 

relations of reproduction are divided into frontal, public, overt - and 
hence coded - relations on the one hand, and, on the other, covert, 
clandestine and repressed relations which, precisely because they are 
repressed, characterize transgressions related not so much to sex per se 
as to sexual pleasure, i ts preconditions and consequences. 

Thus space may be said to embrace a multitude of intersections, each 
with its ass igned location . As_J.qr_ ��PJ�sencations_.Qf die relations of 
production,  which subsume power relations, these too occur in space: 
space contains them in the Torm of '6uiiai ngs ; monuments and works of 
arr-:- Such frontal (and hence brutal) expressions of these relations do not 
��mpletely crowd out their more clandestine or underground aspects ; all 
power must have its accomplices - and its police. 

A conceptual triad has now emerged from our discussion, a triad to 
which we shall be returning over and over again. 

1 Spatial practice, which embraces production and reproduction, 
and the particular locations and spatial sets characteristic of 
each social formation. Spatial practice ensures continuity and 
some degree of cohesion. In terms of social space, and of each 
member of a given society 's relationship to that space, this 
cohesion implies a guaranteed level of competence and a specific 
level of performance.3 1 

2 Representations of space, which are tied to the relations of 
production and to the 'order' which those relations impose, and 
hence to knowledge, to signs, to codes, and to 'frontal' relations. 

3 Representational spaces, embodying complex symbolisms, some­
times coded, sometimes not, linked to the clandestine or under­
ground side of social life, as also to art (which may come 
eventually to be defined less as a code of space than as a code 
of representational spaces).

In reality, social space 'incorporates' social actions, the actions of sub­
jects both individual and collective who are born and who die, who 
suffer and who act. From the point of view of these subjects, the

behaviour of their space is at once vital and mortal: within it they 
develop, give expression to themselves, and encounter prohibitions; then 
they perish, and that same space contains their graves. From the point 
of view of knowing (connaissance) , social space works (along with its 
concept) ;is a tool for the analysis ofsocle!):-:-To-accept this much is at 
once to eilmiriafelne-Sin1plistic modei of a one-to-one or 'punctual' 
correspondence between social actions and social locations, between 
spatial functions and spatial forms. Precisely because of its crudeness, 
however, this 'structural' schema continues to haunt our consciousness 
and knowledge (savoir) . 

It is not the work of a moment for a society to generate (produce) 
an appropriated social space in which it can achieve a form by means 
of self-presentation and self-representation - a social space to which 
that society is not identical, and which indeed is i ts tomb as well as its 
cradle. This act of creation is, in fact, a process . For it to occur, it is 
necessary (and this necessity is precisely what has to be explained) for 
the society's practical capabilities and sovereign powers to have at 
their disposal special places :  religious and political sites. In the case of 
precapitalist societies, more readily comprehensible to anthropology, 
ethnology and sociology than to political economy, such sites are needed 
for symbolic sexual unions and murders, as places where the principle 
of fertility (the Mother) may undergo renewal and where fathers, chiefs, 
kings, priests and sometimes gods may be put to death. Thus space 
emerges consecrated - yet at the same time protected from the forces 
of good and evil : it retains the aspect of those forces which facilitates 
social continuity, but bears no trace of their other, dangerous side. 

A further necessity is that space - natural and social, practical and 
symbolic - should come into being inhabited by a (signifying and 
signified) higher 'reality'. By Light, for instance - the light of sun, moon 
or stars as opposed to the shadows, the night, and hence death ; light 
identified with the True, with life, and hence with thought and knowl­
edge and, ultimately, by virtue of mediations not immediately apparent, 
with established authority. So much is intimated by myths, whether 
Western or Oriental, but it is only actualized in and through (religio­
political) space. Like all social practice, spatial practice is lived directly 
before it is conceptualized; but the speculative primacy of the conceived 
over the lived causes practice to disappear along with life, and so does 
very little justice to the 'unconscious' level of lived experience per se. 

Yet another requirement is that the family (long very large, but never 
unlimited in size) be rejected as sole centre or focus of social practice, 
for such a state of affairs would entail the dissolution of society ; but at 



PLAN OF THE PRESENT W O R K  35 

the same time that it be  retained and maintained as  the 'basis ' of  personal 
and direct relationships which are bound to nature, to the eanh, to 
procreation, and thus to reproduction. 

Lastly, death must be both represented and rejected. Death too has a 
'location', but that location lies below or above appropriated social 
space; death is relegated to the infinite realm so as to disenthral (or 
purify ) the finiteness in which social practice occurs, in which the law 
that that practice has established holds sway. Social space thus remains 
the space of society, of social l ife. Man does not live by words alone; 
all 'subjects ' are situated in a space in which they must either recognize 
themselves or lose themselves, a space which they may both enjoy and 
modify. In order to accede to this space, individuals (children, 
adolescents) who are, paradoxically, already within it, must pass tests. 
This has the effect of setting up reserved spaces, such as places of 
initiation, within social space. All holy or cursed places, places charac­
terized by the presence or absence of gods, associated with the death of 
gods, or with hidden powers and their exorcism - all such places qualify 
as special preserves . Hence in absolute space the absolute has no place, 
for otherwise it would be a 'non-place' ; and religio-political space has 
a rather strange composition, being made up of areas set apart, reserved 
- and so mysterious. 

As for magic and sorcery, they too have their own spaces, opposed 
to (but presupposing) religio-political space; also set apart and reserved, 
such spaces are cursed rather than blessed and beneficent. By contrast, 
certain ludic spaces, devoted for their part to religious dances, music, 
and so on, were always felt to be beneficent rather than baleful. 

Some would doubtless argue that the ultimate foundation of social 
space is prohibition, adducing in support of this thesis the unsaid in 
communication between the members of a society; the gulf between 
them, their bodies and consciousnesses, and the difficulties of social 
intercourse; the dislocation of their most immediate relationships (such 
as the child's with its mother), and even the dislocation of their bodily 
integrity ; and, lastly, the never fully achieved restoration of these 
relations in an 'environment' made up of a series of zones defined by 
interdictions and bans. 

Along the same lines, one might go so far as to explain social space 
in terms of a dual prohibition: the prohibition which separates the 
(male) child from his mother because incest is forbidden, and the prohib­
ition which separates the child from its body because language in 
constituting consciousness breaks down the unmediated unity of the 
body - because, in other words, the (male) child suffers symbolic cas-

tration and his own phallus is objectified for him as part of outside 
reality. Hence the Mother, her sex and her blood, are relegated to the 
realm of the cursed and the sacred - along with sexual pleasure, which 
is thus rendered both fascinating and inaccessible. 

The trouble with this thesis 32 is that it assumes the logical, epistemo­
logical and anthropological priority of language over space. By the same 
token, it puts prohibitions - among them that against incest - and not 
productive activity, at the origin of society. The pre-existence of an 
objective, neutral and empty space is simply taken as read, and only the 
space of speech (and writing) is dealt with as something that must be 
created. These assumptions obviously cannot become the basis for an 
adequate account of social/spatial practice. They apply only to an 
imaginary society, an ideal type or model of society which this ideology 
dreams up and then arbitrarily identifies with all 'real' societies. All the 
same, the existence within space of phallic verticality, which has a long 
history but which at present is becoming more prevalent, cries out for 
explanation . The same might be said apropos of the general fact that 
walls, enclosures and fa<;ades serve to define both a scene (where some­
thing takes place) and an obscene area to which everything that cannot 
or may not happen on the scene is relegated: whatever is inadmissible, 
be it malefic or forbidden, thus has its own hidden space on the near 
or the far side of a frontier. It is true that explaining everything in 
psychoanalytic terms, in terms of the unconscious, can only lead to 
an intolerable reductionism and dogmatism; the same goes for the 
overestimation of the 'structural' .  Yet structures do exist, and there is 
such a thing as the 'unconscious'. Such little-understood aspects of 
consciousness would provide sufficient justification in themselves for 
research in this area. If it turned out, for instance, that every society, 
and particularly (for our purposes) the city, had an underground and 
repressed life, and hence an 'unconscious' of its own, there can be no 
doubt that interest in psychoanalysis, at present on the decline, would 
get a new lease on life.

'object' of interest must be expected to shift from things in �..ro__tlie._ 
actual p_rocf_t:t.£.!ion __ of. space, but this to;:;°nulation itse l f  calls for much 
additional explanation. Both partial products located in space - that is, 
th ings - and discourse on space can henceforth do no more than supply 
clues to, and testimony about, this productive process - a process which 
subsumes signifying processes without being reducible to them. It is no 
longer a matter of the space of this or the space of that: rather, it is 
space in its totality or global aspect that needs not only to be subjected 
to analytic scrutiny (a procedure which is liable to furnish merely an 
infinite series of fragments and cross-sections subordinate co the analytic 
project) ,  but also to be engendered by and within theoretical understand­
ing. Theory reproduces the generative process - by means of a concat­
enation of concepts, to be sure, but in a very strong sense of the word: 
from within, not just from without (descriptively) , and globally - that 
is, moving continually back and forth between past and present. The 
historical and its consequences, the 'diachronic', the 'etymology' of 
locations in the sense of what happened at a particular spot or place 
and thereby changed it - all of this becomes inscribed in space. The 
past leaves its traces ; time has its own script. Yet this space is always, 
now and formerly, a present space, given as an immediate whole, 
complete with its associations and connections in their actuality. Thus 
production process and product present themselves as two inseparable 
aspects, not as two separable ideas. 

It might be objected that at such and such a period, in such and such 
a society (ancient/slave, medieval/feudal, etc. ) ,  the active groups did not 
'produce' space in the sense in which a vase, a piece of furn iture, a 
house, or a fruit tree is 'produced' .  So how exactly did those groups 
contrive to produce their space ? The question is a highly pertinent 
one and covers all 'fields' under consideration. Even neocapitalism or 
'organized' capitalism, even technocratic planners and programmers, 
cannot produce a space with a perfectly clear understanding of cause 
and effect, motive and implication . 

Specialists in a number of 'disciplines' might answer or try co answer 
the question. Ecologists, for example, would very likely take natural 
ecosystems as a point of departure. They would show how the actions 
of human groups upset the balance of these systems, and how in most 
cases, where 'pre-technological' or 'archaeo-technological' societies are 
concerned, the balance is subsequently restored. They would then exam­
ine the development of the relationship between town and country, the 
perturbing effects of the town, and the possibility or impossibility of a 
· new balance being established. TI1en, from their point of view, they 



3 8  PLAN O F  THE !' R F. S E N T  W O R K  

would adequately have clari fied and even explained the genesis of mod­
ern social space. Historians, for their pa rt, would doubtless take a 
different approach, or rather a number of di fferent approaches according 
to the individual 's method or orientation. Those who concern themselves 
chiefly with events might be incl ined to establ ish a chronology of 
decisions a ffecting the relations between cities and their territorial depen­
dencies, or to study the construction of monumental bui ldings. Others 
m ight seek to reconstitute the rise and fa l l  of the institutions which 
underwrote those monuments. Sti l l  others would lean toward an econ­
omic study of exchange between city and terri tory, town and town, 
state and town, and so on . 

To follow this up further, let us return to the tqree con_i:e£!s introduced 
earlier.

What is spatia l  practice under neocapita l ism ? I t  embodies a close 
association, within perceived space, between daily rea l ity (daily routine) 
and urban reality (the roJ.1_tes and networks which l ink up the places set 
aside for work, 'private' l i fe 

-
and leisure ) .  This association is a paradoxi­

cal one, because i t  includes the _most extreme separation between the 
places i t  l inks togeth�!llespe�ific spit:ial competence a1id performance 
of  every society member can only be evaluated empirical ly .  'Modern' 
sp.atiaLgrn_ctice might thus be defined - to take an extreme but significant 
case - by the dai ly l i fe of a tenant in a government-subsidized high-rise 
housing project. Which should not be taken to mean that 1!1Qtorway.s.. 
or the politics of a i r  transport can be left out of the picture. A spatial 
practice must have a certain cohesiveness, but th is does not imply that 
it is coherent ( in the sense of intellectually worked out or logical ly 
conceived ) .  

2 Representations of  space: conceptual ized space, the space of scien­
tists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and socia l  engineers, 
as of  a certain type of artist with a scientific bent - all of whom identify 
what is l ived and what is perceived with what is conceived. (Arcane 
speculation about Numbers, with its talk of the golden number, modul i  
and 'canons', tends to  perpetuate this view of matters . )  This is the 



PLAN OF THE PRESENT W O R K  39 

dominant space in  any society (or mode of production) . Conceptions of 
space tend, with certain exceptions to which I shall return, towards a 
system of verbal (and therefore intellectually worked out) signs. 

3 Representational spaces : space as di rectly lived through its associ­
ated images and symbols, and hence the space of 'inhabitants' and 
'users ' ,  but also of some artists and perhaps of those, such as a few 
writers and philosophers, who describe and aspire to do no more than 
describe . This is the dominated - and hence passively experienced -
space wh ich the imagination seeks to change and appropriate. ' It overlays 
physical space, making symbolic use of its objects. Thus representational 
spaces may be said, though again with certain exceptions, to tend 
towards more or less coherent systems of non-verbal symbols and signs. 

The ( re lative) autonomy achieved by space qua 'reality' during a long 
process which has occurred especially under capitalism or neocapitalism 
has brought new contradictions into play. The contradictions within 
space itself will be explored later .  For the moment I merely wish to 
point up the dialectical relationship which exists within the triad of the 
perceived, the conceived, and the lived. 

A triad: that is, three elements and not two. Relations with two 
elements boil down to oppositions, contrasts or antagonisms. They 
are defined by significant effects: echoes,  repercussions, mirror effects. 
Philosophy has found it very difficult to get beyond such dualisms as 
subject and object, Descartes's res cogitans and res extensa, and the Ego 
and non-Ego of the Kantians, post-Kantians and neo-Kantians .  'Binary' 
theories of this sort no longer have anything whatsoever in common 
with the Manichaean conception of a bitter struggle between two cosmic 
principles; their  dualism is entirely mental, and strips everything which 
makes for living activity from life, thought and society (i .e .  from the 
physical, menta l and social, as from the lived, perceived and conceived). 
After the titanic effects of Hegel and Marx to free it from this straitjacket, 
philosophy reverted to supposedly ' relevant' dualities, drawing with it 
- or perhaps being drawn by - several special ized sciences, and proceed­
ing, in the name of transparency, to define intelligibility in terms of 
opposites and systems of opposites . Such a system can have neither 
materiality nor loose ends : it is a 'perfect' system whose rationality is 
supposed, when subjected to mental scrutiny, to be self-evident. This 
paradigm apparently has the magic power to turn obscurity into trans­
parency and to move the 'object' out of the shadows into the light 



40 PLAN O F  THE P R ES E N T  W O R K  

merely by articulating it. In short, it has the power to decrypt. Thus 
knowledge (savoir) , with a remarkable absence of consciousness, put 
itself in thrall to power, suppressing all resistance, all obscurity, in its 
very being. 

In seeking to understand the three moments of social space, it may 
\ help to consider the body. All the more so inasmuch as the relationship 

to space of a ' subject' who is a member of a group or society implies 
his relationship to his own body and vice versa. Considered overall, 
social practice presuppos�s th_e -��e Qf t_h�. ):i_��!he use of the hands, 
members and sensory organs, and the gestures of work as of activity 
unrelated to work. This is the realm of the perceived (the practical basis 
of the perception of the outside world, to put it in psychology's terms). 
As for representations of the body, they derive from accumulated scien­
tific knowledge, disseminated with an admixture of ideology: from 
knowledge of anatomy, of physiology, of sickness and its cure, and of 
the body's relations with nature and with its surroundings or 'milieu'. 
Bodily lived experience, for its part, maybe both highly complex and 
quite peculiar, because 'culture' intervenes here, with its illusory immedi­
acy, via symbolisms and via the long Judaeo-Christian tradition, certain 
aspects of which are uncovered by psychoanalysis. The 'heart' as lived 
is strangely different from the heart as thought and perceived. The same 
holds a fortiori for the sexual organs. Localizations can absolutely not 
be taken for granted where the lived experience of the body is concerned: 
under the pressure of morality, it is even possible to achieve the strange 
result of a body without organs - a body chastised, as it were, to the 
point of being castrated. 

The perceived-conceived-lived triad (in spatial terms: spatial practice, 
representations of space, representational spaces) loses all force if it is 
treated as an abstract 'model'. If it cannot grasp the concrete (as distinct 
from the 'immediate' ) ,  then its import is severely limited, amounting to 
no more than that of one ideological mediation among others. 

That the lived, conceived and perceived realms should be intercon­
nected, so that the 'subject', the individual member of a given social 
group, may move from one to another without confusion - so much is 
a logical necessity. Whether they constitute a coherent whole is another 
matter. They probably do so only in favourable circumstances, when a 
common language, a consensus and a code can be established. It is 
reasonable to assume that the Western town, from the Italian Renaiss­
ance to the nineteenth century, was fortunate enough to enjoy such 
auspicious conditions. During this period the representation of space 
tended to dominate and subordinate a representational space, of religious 



PLAN OF T H E  P R E S E NT W O R K  41 

origin, which was now reduced to symbolic figures, to images of Heaven 
and Hell, of the Devil and the angels, and so on. Tuscan painters, 
architects and theorists developed a representation of space - perspective 
- on the basis of a social practice which was itself, as we shall see, the 
result of a h istoric change in the relationship between town and country .  
Common sense meanwhile, though more or less reduced to silence, was 
still preserving virtually intact a representational space, inherited from 
the Etruscans, which had survived all the centuries of Roman and 
Christian dominance. The vanishing line, the vanishing-point and the 
meeting of parallel lines ' at infinity' were the determinants of a represen­
tation, at  once intellectual and visual, which promoted the primacy of 
the gaze in a kind of 'logic of visualization' .  This representation, which 
had been in the making for centuries, now became enshrined in a rchitec­
tural and urbanistic practice as the code of linear perspective. 

For the present investigation to be brought to a satisfactory con­
clusion, for the theory 1 am proposing to be confirmed as fa r as is 
possible, the distinctions drawn above would have to be generalized in 
their application to cover all societies, all periods, all 'modes of pro­
duction '. That is too tall an order for now, however, and I shall at this 
point merely advance a number of preliminary a rguments. I would 
argue, for example, that representations of space are shot through with 
a knowledge (savoir) - i.e. a mixture of understanding (connaissance) 
and ideology - which is always relative and in the process of  change. 
Such representations are thus objective, though subject to revision .  Are 
they then true or false ? The question does not always have a clear 
meaning: what does it mean, for example, to ask whether perspective 
is true or false ? Representations of space a re certainly abstract, but they 
also play a part in social and political practice : established relations 
between objects and people in represented space are subordinate to a 
logic which will sooner or later break them up because of their lack of 
consistency . Representational spaces, on the other hand, need obey 
no rules of consistency or cohesiveness. Redolent with imaginary and 
symbolic elements, they have their source in history - in the history of 
a people as well as in the history of each individual belonging to that 
people. Ethnologists, anthropologists and psychoanalysts are students 
of such representational spaces, whether they are aware of it or not, 
but they nearly always forget to set them alongside those representations 
of space which coexist, concord or interfere with them; they even more 
frequently ignore social practice. By contrast, these experts have no 
difficulty discerning those aspects of representational spaces which inter­
est them: childhood memories, dreams, or uterine images and symbols 



42 PLAN OF TH E PRESENT W O R K  

(holes, passages, labyrinths) .  Representational space is alive: it speaks. 
It has an affective kernel or centre : Ego, bed, bedroom, dwelling, house ; 
or: square, church, graveyard. It embraces the loci of passion, of action 
and of lived situations, and thus immediately implies time. Consequently 
it may be qualified in various ways: it may be directional, situational 
or relational, because it is essentially qualitative, fluid and dynamic. 

If this distinction were generally applied, we should have to look at 
history itself in a new light. We should have to study not only the 
history of space, but also the history of representations, along with that 
of their relationships - with each other, with practice, and with ideology. 
History would have to take in not only the genesis of these spaces but 
also, and especially, their interconnections, distortions, displacements, 
mutual interactions, and their links with the spatial practice of the 
particular society or mode of production under consideration. 

We may be sure that representations of space have a practical impact, 
' that they intervene in and modify spatial textures which are informed 
by effective knowledge and ideology. Representations of space must 
therefore have a substantial role and a specific influence in the pro­
duction of space. Their intervention occurs by way of construction - in 
other words, by way of architecture, conceived of not as the building 
of a particular structure, palace or monument, but rather as a project 

· embedded in a spatial context and a texture which call for 'represen­
tations' that will not vanish into the symbolic or imaginary realms. 

By contrast, the only products of representational spaces are symbolic 
works. These are often unique ; sometimes they set in train 'aesthetic' 
trends and, after a time, having provoked a series of manifestations and 
incursions into the imaginary, run out of steam. 

This distinction must, however, be handled with considerable caution. 
For one thing, there is a danger of its introducing divisions and so 
defeating the object of the exercise, which is to rediscover the unity of 
the productive process. Furthermore, it is not at all clear a priori that 
it can legitimately be generalized. Whether the East, specifically China, 
has experienced a contrast between representations of space and rep­
resentational spaces is doubtful in the extreme. It is indeed quite possible 
that the Chinese characters combine two functions in an inextricable 
way, that on the one hand they convey the order of the world 
(space-time) ,  while on the other hand they lay hold of that concrete 
(practical and social) space-time wherein symbolisms hold sway, where 
works of art are created, and where buildings, palaces and temples are 
built. I shall return to this question later - although, lacking adequate 
knowledge of the Orient, I shall offer no definite answer to it. On the

other hand, apropos of the West, and of Western practice from ancient 
Greece and Rome onwards, I shall be seeking to show the development 
of this distinction, its import and meaning. Not, be it said right away, 
that the distinction has necessarily remained unchanged in the West 
right up until the modern period, or that there have never been role 
reversals (representational spaces becoming responsible for productive 
activity, for example) .  

There have been societies - the Chavin o f  the Peruvian Andes are a� 
case in point33 - whose representation of space is attested to by the r 
plans of their temples and palaces, while their representational space 1 
appears in their art works, writing-systems, fabrics, and so on. What 
would be the relationship between two such aspects of a particular 
period ? A problem confronting us here is that we are endeavouring with 
conceptual means to reconstruct a connection which originally in no 
way resembled the application of a pre-existing knowledge to 'reality'. 
Things become very difficult for us in that symbols which we can readily 
conceive and intuit are inaccessible as such to our abstract knowledge 
- a knowledge that is bodiless and timeless, sophisticated and efficacious, 
yet 'unrealistic' with respect to certain ' realities'. The question is what 
intervenes, what occupies the interstices between representations of space 
and representational spaces. A culture, perhaps ? Certainly - but the 
word has less content than it seems to have. The work of artistic 
creation ? No doubt - but that leaves unanswered the queries 'By whom?'  
and 'How? '  Imagination ? Perhaps - but why ? and for whom? 

The distinction would be even more useful if it could be shown that 
today's theoreticians and practitioners worked either for one side of it 
or the other, some developing representational spaces and the remainder 
working out representations of space. It is arguable, for instance, that 
Frank Lloyd Wright endorsed a communitarian representational space 
deriving from a biblical and Protestant tradition, whereas Le Corbusier 
was working towards a technicist, scientific and intellectualized represen­
tation of space. 

Perhaps we shall have to go further, and conclude that the producers 
of space have always acted in accordance with a representation, while 
the 'users' passively experienced whatever was imposed upon them 
inasmuch as it was more or less thoroughly inserted into, or j ustified

by, their representational space. How such manipulation might occur is 
a matter for our analysis to determine. If arch i tects (and urban planners) 
do i ndeed have a representation of space, whence does i t  derive ? Whose 
interests are served when i t  becomes 'operational ' ?  As to whether or 
not ' inhabitants' possess a representational space, if we arrive at an 
affirmative answer, we shall be well on the way to dispel l ing a curious 
misunderstanding (which is not to say that this misunderstanding wil l 
disappear in social and polit ical practice ) .  

The fact is that the long-obsolescent notion of ideology is now truly 
on its last legs, even if critical theory sti l l holds it to be necessary . At 
no time has this concept been clear. It has been much abused by 
evocations of Marxist, bourgeois, proletarian, revolutionary or social ist 
ideology; and by incongruous distinctions between ideology in general 
and specific ideologies, between ' ideological apparatuses' and insti­
tutions of knowledge, and so forth . 

What is an ideology without a space to which it refers, a space which 
it describes, whose vocabulary and l inks it makes use of, and whose 
code i t embodies ? What would remain of a rel igious ideology - the 
Judaeo-Christian one, say - i f  it were not based on places and their 
names: church, confessional, altar, sanctuary, tabernacle ? What would 
remain o f  the Church i f  there were no churches ? The Christian ideology, 
carrier of a recognizable if disregarded Judaism (God the Father, etc. ) ,  
ha s  created the spaces which guarantee that it endures. More generally 
speaking, what we cal l ideology only ach ieves consistency by intervening 
in social space and in its production, and by thus taking on body therein .  
Ideology per s e  might well be said to consist primari ly i n  a discourse 
upon social space. 

According to a wel l -known formulation of Marx's, knowledge 
(connaissance) becomes a productive force immediately, and no longer 
through any mediation, as soon as the capital ist mode of production 
takes over.34 I f so, a definite change in the relationship between ideology 
and knowledge must occur : knowledge must replace ideology. Ideology, 
to the extent that i t  remains disti nct from knowledge, is characterized 
by rhetoric, by metalanguage, hence by verbiage and lucubration (and 
no longer by ph i losophico-metaphysical systematizing, by 'culture' and 
'values ' ) .  Ideology and logic may even become indistinguishable - at 
least to the extent that a stubborn demand for coherence and cohesion

manages to erase countervai l ing factors proceeding either from above 
( information and knowledge [savoir] ) or from below ( the space of daily 
l i fe ) .  

Representations o f  space have at times combined ideology and knowl­
edge within a ( socia l -spa tia l )  practice. Classical perspective is the perfect 
i l lustration of chis . The space of today's planners, whose system of 
local ization assigns an exact spot to each activity, is anocher case in 
point. 

The area where ideology and knowledge are barely distinguishable is 
subsumed under the broader notion of representation,  which thus sup­
plants the concept of ideology and becomes a serviceable (operational ) 
tool for the analysis of spaces, as of those societies which have given 
rise to them and recogn ized themselves in them. 

In the Middle Ages, spatial practice embraced not only the network 
of loca l roads close to peasant communities, monasteries and cascles, 
but also the main roads between towns and the great pilgrims' and 
crusaders' ways. As for representations of space, these were borrowed 
from Aristotel ian and Ptolemaic conceptions, as modified by Christian­
ity : the Earth , the underground 'world' , and the luminous Cosmos, 
Heaven of the j ust and of the angels, inhabited by God the Father, God 
the Son , and God the Holy Ghost. A fixed sphere within a finite space, 
diametrical ly bi sected by the surface of the Earth ; below this surface, 
the fires of Hel l ;  above it, in the upper half of the sphere, the Firmament 
- a cupola bearing the fixed stars and the circling planets - and a space 
criss-crossed by divine messages and messengers and fil led by the radiant 
Glory of the Tri nity. Such is the conception of space found in Thomas 
Aquinas and in the Divine Comedy. Representational spaces, for their 
part, determined the foci of a vicinity : the vi l lage church, graveyard, ha l l  
and fields, or the square and the bel fry. Such spaces were interpretations, 
sometimes marvellously successfu l ones, of cosmological representations. 
Thus the road to Santiago de Compostela was the equivalent, on the 
earth 's surface, of the Way that led from Cancer to Capricorn on the 
vault of the heavens, a route otherwise known as the Milky Way - a 
trail of divine sperm where souls are born before fol lowing its downward 
tra jectory and fa l l ing to earth, there to seek as best they may the 
path of redemption - namely, the pilgrimage that wil l bring them to 
Compostela ( ' the field of stars ' ) .  The body too, unsurprisingly, had a 
role in the interplay between representations relating to space. 'Taurus 
rules over the neck' ,  wrote Albertus Magnus, 'Gemini over the shou lders ; 
Cancer over the hands and arms; Leo over the breast, the heart and the 



46 P L A N  OF T H E  PRESENT W O R K  

diaphragm; Vi rgo over the stomach ; Libra takes care of the second part 
of the back; Scorpio is responsible for those parts that belong to 
lust. 

It i s reasonable to assume that spatial practice, representations of 
space and representational spaces contribute in different ways to the 
production of space according to the ir qual ities and attributes, according 
to the society or mode of production in question, and according to the 
h istorica l period. Relations between the three moments of the perceived, 
the conceived and the lived are never either simple or stable, nor are 
they 'positive' in the sense in which this term might be opposed to 
'negative' ,  to the indecipherable, the unsaid, the prohibi ted, or the 
unconscious. Are these moments and their interconnections in fact con­
scious ? Yes - but at the same time they are disregarded or misconstrued. 
Can they be described as 'unconscious ' ?  Yes again, because they are 
general ly unknown, and because analysis is able - though not always 
without error - to rescue them from obscurity. The fact is, however, 
that these relationships have always had to be given utterance, which is 
not the same thing as being known - even 'unconsciously ' .  

XVIII 

If space is produced, if there is a productive process, then we are dealing 
with history; here we have the fourth implication of our hypothesis. 
The h istory of space, of its production qua ' real ity' , and of its forms 
and representations, is not to be confused either with the causal chain 
of 'h istorical ' ( i . e .  dated) events, or with a sequence, whether teleological 
or not, of customs and laws, ideals and ideology, and socio-economic 
structures or institutions (superstructures ) .  But we may be sure that the 
forces of production (nature; labour and the organization of labour; 
technology and knowledge) and, natural ly, the relations of production 
play a part - though we have not yet defined it - in the production of 
space. 

I t should be clear from the above that the passage from one mode of 
production to another is of the highest theoretical importance for our 
purposes, for i t  resu l ts from contradictions in the social relations of 
production which cannot fai l  to leave their mark on space and indeed 
to revolutionize it. Since , ex hypothesi, each mode of production has its 
own particu lar space, the shift from one mode to another must entail 
the production of a new space. Some people claim a special status for 
the mode of production, wh ich they conceive of as a finished whole 



Pl.AN OF T H E  PRESENT W O R K  47 

or closed system ; the type of thinking which is forever search ing for 
transparency or substant ia l i ty, or both, has a natural predil ection for 
an 'object' of this kind. Contrary to this view of matters, however, 
examination of the transitions between modes of production will reveal 
that a fresh space is indeed generated during such changes, a space 
which is planned and organized subsequently. Take for example the 
Renaissance town, the dissolution of the feudal system and the rise of 
merchant capita l ism. Th is was the period during which the code already 
referred to above was consti tuted ; the analysis of this code - with the 
accent on its paradigmatic aspects - wil l take up a good few pages later 
in the present discussion. It began forming in antiquity, in the Greek 
and Roman cities, as also in the works of Vitruvius and the phi losophers; 
later i t  would become the language of the writer. l e  corresponded to 
spatial practice, and doubtless to the representation of space rather than 
to representational spaces stil l permeated by magic and rel igion. What 
the establ ishment of this code meant was that 'people' - inhabitants, 
bui lders, politicians - stopped going from urban messages to the code 
in order to decipher rea l i ty, to decode town and country, and began 
instead to go from code to messages, so as to produce a discourse and 
a rea l i ty adequate to the code. Th is code thus has a h istory, a h istory 
determined, in the West, by the entire history of cities. Eventual ly it 
would al low the organization of the cities, which had been several times 
overturned, to become knowledge and power - to become, in other 
words, an institution. This development heralded the decl ine and fa l l of 
the autonomy of the towns and urban systems in their h istorical reality. 
The state was built on the back of the old cities, and their structure and 
code were shattered in the process. Notice that a code of this kind is a 
superstructure, which is not true of the town itself, its space, or the 
'town-country' relationsh ip with in that space. The code served to fix 
the alphabet and language of the town, its primary signs, their pa radigm 
and their syntagmatic relations. To put it in less abstract terms, fai;ades 
were harmonized to create perspectives; entrances and exits, doors and 
windows, were subordinated to fai;ades - and hence also to perspectives; 
streets and squares were arranged in concord with the public bui ldings 
and palaces of political leaders and institutions (with municipal authorit­
ies stil l predominating) . At all levels, from family dwel l ings to monumen­
tal edifices, from 'private' areas to the territory as a whole, the elements 
of this space were disposed and composed in a manner at once fami l iar 
and surprising which even in the late twentieth century has not lost i ts 
charm. It is clear, therefore, that a spatial code is not s imply a means 
of reading or interpreting space : rather i t is a means of living in that 



48 P L A N  O F  THE PRESENT W O R K  

space, of understanding it , and of producing i t .  As such it brings together 
verbal signs (words and sentences, along with the meaning invested in 
them by a signifying process) and non-verbal signs (music, sounds, 
evocations, arch i tectural constructions ) .  

The h istory of space cannot be l imited to the study of the specia l  
moments constituted by the formation, establ ishment, decl ine and dissol­
ution of a given code. It must deal also with the globa l aspect - with 
modes of production as generali ties covering specific societies with their 
particular h istories and institutions. Furthermore, the h istory of space 
may be expected to periodize the development of the productive process 
in a way that does not correspond exactly to widely accepted periodiza­
tions .  

Absolute space was made up of fragments of nature located at sites 
which were chosen for their intrinsic qua l ities (cave, mountaintop, 
spring, river), but whose very consecration ended up by stripping them 
of their natural characteristics and uniqueness. Thus natural space was 
soon populated by pol itical forces. Typical ly, arch itecture picked a site 
in nature and transferred it to the political rea lm by means of a symbolic 
mediation ; one thinks, for example, of the statues of local gods or 
goddesses in Greek temples, or of the Shintoist's sanctuary, empty or 
else containing nothing but a mirror. A sanctified inwardness set itsel f 
up in opposition to the outwardness in nature, yet at the same time i t 
echoed and restored that outwardness. The absolute space where ri tes 
and ceremonies were performed retained a number of aspects of nature, 
a lbeit in a form modified by ceremonial requirements : age, sex, genital i ty 
( ferti l ity) - al l sti l l had a part to play. At once civi l and rel igious, absolute 
space thus preserved and incorporated bloodlines, family, unmediated 
relationships - but it transposed them to the city, to the political state 
founded on the town. The socio-pol itical forces which occupied this 
space also had their administrative and mil itary extensions : scribes and 
armies were very much part of the picture. Those who produced space 
(peasants or artisans) were not the same people as managed it, as used 
it to organize socia l production and reproduction ; it was the priests, 
warriors, scri bes and princes who possessed what others had produced, 
who appropriated space and became its fu l ly enti tled owners. 

Absolute space, rel igious and political in character, was a product of 
the bonds of consanguin ity, soil and language, but out of it evolved a 
space which was relativized and historical. Not that absolute space 
disappeared in the process ;  rather it survived as the bedrock of historical 
space and the basis of representational spaces ( religious, magical and 
political symbolisms) . Quickened by an internal dialectic which urged 



P L A N  OF TH E PRESENT W O R K  49 

i t on towards i t s demise though simultaneously prolonging i ts l i fe, 
absolu te space embodied an antagonism between ful l  and empry. After 
the fashion of a cathedra l 's 'nave' or 'ship ' , the invisible fu l lness of 
political space ( the space of the town-state's nucleus or 'city ' )  set up its 
rule in the emptiness of a natural space confiscated from nature. Then 
the forces of h istory smashed naturalness forever and upon its ruins 
established the space of accumulation (the accumulation of al l wealth 
and resou rces : knowledge, technology, money, precious objects, works 
of art and symbols ) .  For the theory of th is accumulation, and particu larly 
of  its primi tive stage, in which the respective roles of nature and h istory 
are st i l l hard to distinguish, we are indebted to Marx ; but, inasmuch as 
Marx's theory is incomplete, I shal l have occasion to discuss this further 
below. One 'subject' dominated this period : the h istorical town of the 
West, a long with the countryside under its control . It was during this 
time that productive activ i ry ( labour) became no longer one with the 
process of reproduction which perpetuated social l i fe ;  but, in becoming 
independent of that process, labour fel l prey to abstraction, whence 
abstract social labour - and abstract space. 

This abstract space took over from historical space, wh ich nevertheless 
l ived on, though gradual ly losing its force, as substratum or under­
pinning of representational spaces. Abstract space functions 'objectal ly ' , 
as a set of  things/signs and thei r formal relationships: glass and stone� 
concrete and steel ,  angles and cu rves, fu l l  and empty. Formal anJ1 
quantitative, it erases distinctions, as much those which derive from 
natu re and (h istorical )  time as those which originate in the body (age, 
sex, ethnicity) . The sign ification of this ensemble refers back to a sort 
of super-signification which escapes meaning's net: the functioning of 
capita l ism, which contrives to be blatant and covert at one and the same 
time. The dominant form of space, that of the centres of wealth and 
power, endeavours to mould the spaces i t dominates ( i .e . peripheral 
spaces) , and i t seeks, often by violent means, to reduce the obstacles 
and resistance it encounters there. Differences, for their part, are forced 
into the symbolic forms of an art that is i tsel f  abstract. A symbolism 
derived from that mis-taking of sensory, sensual and sexual which is 
intrinsic to the things/signs of abstract space finds objective expression 
in derivative ways : monuments have a phal l ic aspect, towers exude 
arrogance, and the bureaucratic and political authoritarianism immanent 
to a repressive space is everywhere. Al l of which cal ls , of course, for 
thorough analysis. A characteristic contradiction of abstract space con­
sists in the fact that, al though it denies the sensual and the sexual , i ts 
only immediate point of reference is gen itality : the family unit, the 



50 PLAN O F  T H E  PRESENT W O R K  

type of dwel l ing (apartment, bungalow, cottage, etc. ) ,  fatherhood and 
motherhood, and the assumption that fert i l i ty and fulfi lment are ident­
ica l .  The reproduction of social relations is thus crudely conflated with 
biological reproduction, which is i tsel f conceived of in the crudest and 

1 most simplistic way imaginable. In spatial practice, the reproduction of 
:�ocial relations is p redominant. The representation of space, in thrall j to both knowledge and power, leaves only the narrowest leeway to 
1 representational spaces, which are l imited to works, images and memor­' ies whose content, whether sensory, sensual or sexual , is so far displaced 
that i t barely ach ieves symbolic force. Perhaps young ch i ldren can l ive 
in a space of this kind, with its indifference to age and sex (and even 
to time i tse l f) ,  but adolescence perforce suffers from it, for it cannot 
discern its own rea l i ty therein :  it furnishes no male or female images 
nor any images of possible pleasure. Inasmuch as adolescents are unable 
to chal lenge either the dominant system's imperious archi tecture or i ts 
deployment of signs, it is only by way of revolt that they have any 
prospect of recover ing the world of di fferences - the natural, the sen­
sory/sensual, sexual i ty and pleasure. 

Abstract space is not defined only by the disappearance of trees, or 
by the receding of nature; nor merely by the great empty spaces of the 
state and the mi l itary - plazas that resemble parade grounds; nor even 
by commercial centres packed tight with commodities, money and cars. 
It is not in fact defined on the basis of what is perceived. Its abstraction 
has nothing simple about it: it is not transparent and cannot be reduced 
either to a logic or to a strategy . Coinciding neither with the abstraction 
of the sign, nor with that of the concept, it operates negatively. Abstract 
space relates negatively to that which perceives and underpins it -
namely, the historical and rel igio-pol itical spheres. It also relates nega­
tively to something which it carries with in itsel f and which seeks to 
emerge from i t :  a differential space-time. It has noth ing of a 'subject' 
about it, yet i t acts l ike a subject in that i t transports and maintains 
specific social relations, dissolves others and stands opposed to yet 
others . I t  functions positively vis-a-vis its own impl ications :  technology, 
applied sciences, and knowledge bound to power. Abstract space may 
even be descr ibed as at once, and inseparably, the locus, medium and 
tool of this 'positivity' . How is this possible ? Does i t mean that this space 
could be defined in terms of a rei fying al ienation, on the assumption that 
the mil ieu of the commodity has itself become a commodity to be sold 
wholesale and reta i l ? Perhaps so, yet the 'negativity' of abstract space 
is not negl igible, and its abstraction cannot be reduced to an 'absolute 
thing' . A safer assumption would seem to be that the status of abstract 



PLAN OF TH E PRESENT WO R K  51  

space must henceforward be considered a highly complex one. It i s  true 
that i t  dissolves and incorporates such former 'subjects' as the vi l lage 
and the town; it is also true that it replaces them. It sets itself up as the 
space of power, which wil l (or at any rate may) eventually lead to its 
own dissolution on account of conflicts (contradictions) aris ing within 
it . What we seem to have, then, is an apparent subject, an impersonal 
pseudo-subject, the abstract 'one' of modern socia l space, and - h idden 
within it, concealed by its i l l usory transparency - the real 'subject', 
namely state (polit ical ) power. Within this space, and on the subject of 
this space, everyth ing is openly declared : everyth ing is said or written. 
Save for the fact that there is very l i ttle to be said - and even less to be 
' l ived' , for lived experience is crushed, vanquished by what is 'conceived 
of'. History is experienced as nostalgia , and nature as regret - as a !' 
horizon fast disappearing beh ind us. Th is may explain why affectivity, i 
which, along with the sensory/sensual rea lm, cannot accede to abstract 
space and so informs no symbolism, is referred to by a term that denotes 
both a subject and that subject's denial by the absurd rational i ty of 
space : that term is ' the unconscious' . 

In connection with abstract space, a space which is also instrumental 
(i .e. manipulated by all kinds of 'authori ties ' of which it is the locus 
and mil ieu) , a question arises whose fu l l import will become apparent 
only later. It concerns the silence of the 'users' of this space. Why do 
they al low themselves to be manipulated in ways so damaging to their 
spaces and their daily l i fe without embarking on massive revolts ? Why 
is protest left to 'enl ightened' ,  and hence el ite, groups who are in any 
case largely exempt from these manipulations ? Such elite ci rcles, at the 
margins of political l ife, are highly vocal , but being mere wordmil ls, 
they have l ittle to show for it. How is it that protest is never taken up 
by supposedly left-wing polit ical parties ? And why do the more honest 
politicians pay such a high price for displaying a bare minimum of 
straightforwardness ?35 Has bureaucracy al ready achieved such power 
that no pol i tical force can successful ly resist it? There must be many 
reasons for such a startlingly strong - and worldwide - trend. It is 
difficult to see how so odd an indifference could be maintained without 
diverting the attention and interest of the 'users' elsewhere, without 
throwing sops to them in response to their demands and proposals, or 
without supplying replacement fu lfi lments for thei r (a lbeit vital) objec-

·1 -• I am thinking, for insiance, of the Parti Socia l i ste Unifie (PSU) and its leader Michel 
Rocard, defeated in the French elections of 1 973,  or of George McGovern's defeat in the 
US presidential election of 1 97 1 .  



52 PLAN O F  T H E  PRES ENT W O R K  

t ives. Perhaps i t would be true to say that the place of social space as 
a whole has been usurped by a part of that space endowed with an 
i l lusory specia l status - namely, the part wh ich is concerned with writing 
and imagery, underpinned by the written text ( journal ism, l i terature) ,  
and broadcast by the media ;  a part, in short, tha t  amounts to abstraction 
wielding awesome reductionistic force vis-a-vis ' l ived' experience. 

Given that abstract space is buttressed by non-critical (positive) knowl­
edge, backed up by a frightening capacity for violence, and mainta ined 
by a bureaucracy which has laid hold of the ga ins of capital ism in the 
ascendent and turned them to i ts own profit, must we conclude that 
this space wil l last forever ? If so, we should have to deem it the locus 
and mi l ieu of the u l timate abjection, of that final stabi l i ty forecast by 
Hegel , the end resu l t of socia l entropy. To such a state of affa irs our 
only possible response would be the spasms of what Georges Bata i l le 
cal ls the acepha l .  Whatever traces of vital i ty remained would have a 
wasteland as their only refuge. 

From a less pessimistic standpoin t, it can be shown that abstract space 
harbours specific contradictions. Such spatia l contradictions derive in 
part from the old contradictions thrown up by h istorical t ime. These 
have undergone modifications, however : some are aggravated, others 
b lunted. Amongst them, too, completely fresh contradictions have come 
into being which are l iable eventual ly to precipitate the downfal l of 
abstract space. The reproduction of the socia l rel ations of production 
within this space inevitab ly obeys two tendencies: the dissolution of old 
rel ations on the one hand and the generation of new relations on the 
other. Thus, despite - or rather because of - its negativ i ty, abstract 
space carries with in i tsel f  the seeds of a new kind of space. I sha l l  cal l 
that new space 'd i fferentia l space', because, inasmuch as abstract space 
tends towards homogeneity, towards the el imination of existing differ­
ences or pecul iarities, a new space cannot be born (produced) unless it 
accentuates differences. It wil l also restore uni ty to what abstract space 
breaks up - to the functions, elements and moments of social practice. 
I t will put an end to those local izations wh ich shatter the integri ty of 
the individual body, the socia l body, the corpus of human needs, and 
the corpus of knowledge. By contrast, i t will distinguish what abstract 
space tends to identify - for example, social reproduction and genita l i ty , 
gratification and biological ferti l ity, social relationsh ips and family 
relationships. (The persistence of abstract space notwithstanding, the 
pressure for these distinctions to be drawn is constantly on the increase; 
the space of gratification, for instance, i f  indeed it is ever produced, will 
have nothing whatsoever to do with functional spaces in general, and 



P L A N  OF T H E  PRESENT W O R K  53 

in particular with the space of genitality as expressed in the family cell 
and its insertion into the piled-up boxes of 'modern' buildings, tower 
blocks, 'urban complexes', and what-have-you.) 

XIX 

If  indeed every society produces a space, its own space, this will have 
other consequences in addition to those we have already considered. 
Any 'social existence' aspiring or claiming to be ' real', but failing to 
produce its own space, would be a strange entity, a very peculiar kind 
of abstraction unable to escape from the ideological or even the 'cultural' 
realm. It would fall to the level of folklore and sooner or later disappear1 
altogether, thereby immediately losing its identity, its denomination 
and its feeble degree of reality. This suggests a possible criterion for 
distinguishing between ideology and practice as well as between ideology 
and knowledge (or, otherwise stated, for distinguishing between the 
lived on the one hand and the perceived and the conceived on the 
other, and for discerning their interrelationship, their oppositions and 
dispositions, and what they reveal versus what they conceal) . 

There is no doubt that medievE..LSQd.ecy_ - that is, the feudal mode of 
production, with its variants and local peculiarities - created its own 
space. Medieval space built upon the space constituted in the preceding 
period, and preserved that space as a substrate and prop for its symbols; 
it survives in an analogous fashion itself today. Manors, monasteries, 
cathedrals - these were the strong points anchoring the network of lanes 
and main roads to a landscape transformed by peasant communities. 
This space w-�s the take-off point for Western European capital accumu­
lation, the original source and cradle of which were the towns. 

Capitalism and neocapitalism have produced abstract space, which 
inCiudes the 'world of commodities', its 'logic' and its worldwide stra­
tegies) as well as the power of money and that of the political state. 
T�pace is founded on the vast network of banks, business centres 
a!!d __ _  major productive entities, as also on motorways, airports and 
info�mation lattices. Within this space _the town - once the forcing­
house of accumulation, fountainhead of wealth and centre of historical 
space - has di£integrated. 

What of sq£i:;il_ism _: "c;�, rather, what of what is today so confusedly 
referred to as socialism? There is no 'communist society ' in existence, 
and the very concept of communism has become obscure inasmuch as 
the notion serves chiefly to sustain two opposing yet complementary 



myrhs, rhe myrh of anti-communism on the one hand and rhe myth that 
a communist revolution has been carried through somewhere on the 
other. To rephrase the question therefore : has state socialisl!1__P_r�duced 
a space of_ its O"."_n?  -The -question is not unimportant. A revolution that does not produce 
la new space has not realized its full potential ;  indeed it has failed in 
: that it has not changed life itself, bur has merely changed ideological 
superstructures, institutions or political apparatuses . A social transform­
ation, to be truly revolutionary in character, must manifest a creative 
capacity in its effects on daily life, on language and on space - though 
its impact need not occur at the same rate, or with equal force, in each 
of these areas . 

Which having been said, there is no easy or quick answer to the 
question of 'socialism's' space; much careful thought is called for here. 
It may be that the revolutionary period, the period of intense change, 
merely establishes the preconditions for a new space, and that the 
realization of that space calls for a rather longer period - for a period 
of calm. The prodigious creative ferment in Soviet Russia between 1 920 
and 1 930 was halted even more dramatically in the fields of architecture 
and urbanism than it was in other areas ; and those fertile years were 
followed by years of sterility. What is the significance of this sterile 
outcome? Where can an architectural production be found today that 
might be described as 'socialist' - or even as new when contrasted with 
the corresponding efforts of capitalist planning? In the former Stalinallee, 
East Berlin - now renamed Karl-Marx-Allee? In Cuba, Moscow or 
Peking? Just how wide by now is the rift between the 'real' society 
rightly or wrongly referred to as socialist and Marx and Engels' project 
for a new society? How is the total space_ of a 'socialist' society_ro_l!e

phrase -the-quesrlon _ _ _  even more precisely, what is the relationship 
between, on the one hand, the entirety of thar space which falls under 
the sway of 'socialist' relations of production and, on the other hand, 
the world market, generated by the capitalist mode of production, which 
weighs down so heavily upon the whole planet, imposing its division of 
labour on a worldwide scale and so governing the specific configurations 
of space, of the forces of production within that space, of sources of 
wealth and of economic fluctuations? 

So many questions to which it is difficult at the present time, for lack 
of information or comprehension, to give satisfactory answers. One 



P L A N  Of T H E  PRESENT WO R K  55 

cannot he lp but wonder, however, whether it is legitimate to speak of 
socia l i sm where no arch itectu ral i nnovation has occurred, where no 
specific space has been created ; would it not be more appropriate in 
that case to speak of a fa i led transition ? 

As I hope to make clea r later on, there are two possible ways forward 
for 'socia l ism' . The first of these wou ld opt for accelerating growth, 
whatever the costs, whether for reasons of competit ion, prestige or 
power. According to this scenario, state social ism would aim to do no 
more than perfect capital ist strategies of growth, relyi11g entirely on the 
·proven strengths of la rge-scale enterprise and large cit ies, the latter 
constituting at once great centres of production and great centres of 
pol itical power. The inevitable consequences of th i s approach - namely, 
the aggravation of inequal i ties in development and the abandonment of 
whole regions and whole sectors of the population - are seen from this 
viewpoint as of negl igible importance. The �cond strategy would be 
founded on small and medium-sized businesses and on towns of a size 
compatible with -that emphasis. It would seel< to carry the whole territory 

--;;_nd the whole population forward together in a process which would 
not separate growth from development. The inevitable urbanization of 
society would not take place at the expense of whole sectors, nor would ·i t exacerbate unevenness in growth or development ;  i t would successfu l ly 
transcend the opposition between town and �ountry instead qf degrading 
both by turning them into an undi fferentiated mass. - As for the class stn;ggle, i ts role in -the production of space is a 
cardinal one in that this production is performed solely by classes, 
fractions of classes and groups representative of classes. Today more 
than ever, the class struggle is inscribed in space. Indeed, it is that 
struggle alone which prevents abstract space from taking over the whole 
planet and papering over a l l  di fferences. Only the class struggle has the 
capacity to di fferentiate, to generate di fferences which are not intrinsic 
to economic growth qua strategy, ' logic' or 'system' - that is to say, 
differences which are neither induced by nor acceptable to that growth. 
The forms of the class struggle are now far more varied than formerly. 
Natura l ly , they include the pol i tical action of minorities. 

During the first ha l f  of the twentieth century, agrarian reforms and 
peasant revolutions reshaped the surface of the planet. A l arge portion 
of these changes served the ends of abstract space, because they 
smoothed out and in a sense automatized the previously existing space 
of historic peoples and cities. In more recent times, urban guerri l la 
actions and the intervention of the 'masses' even in urban areas have 
extended this movement, particu larly in Latin America . The events of

May 1 968 in France, when students occupied and took charge of their 
own space, and the working class immediately followed suit, marked a 
new departure. The ha lt ing of this reappropriation of space, though 
doubtless only temporary, has given rise -to a despa iring atl:itude. It is 
argued that only bul ldozers or Molotov cocktails can change the domi-

\ nant organization of space, that destruction must come before recon-
1 struct ion. Fai r  enough, but it is legitimate to ask what ' reconstruction' 
/ entai ls . Are the same means of production to be used to produce the 
i same products ? Or must those means be destroyed also ? The problem 
with this posture is that it min imizes the contradictions in society and 
space as they actual ly are; al though there are no good grounds for doing 
so, it attributes a hermetic or finished qua l i ty to the 'system ' ;  and, in 
the very process of heaping invective upon th i s system, it comes in a 
sense under its spell and succeeds only in  glori fying its power beyond 
all reasonable bounds. Schizophrenic ' leftism' of this kind secretes its 
own, ' unconscious' , contradictions. Its appeal to an absolute spontaneity 
in destruction and construction necessari ly implies the destruction of 
thought, of knowledge, and of al l creative capacities, on the spurious 
grounds that they stand in the way of an immediate and total revolution 
- a revolution, incidental ly, which is never defined. 

Al l the same, there is no getting a round the fact that the bourgeoisie 
sti l l has the in it iative in its struggle for (and in) space. Which brings us 
back to the question of the passivi ty and silence of the 'users' of space. 

Abstract space works in a highly complex way. I t  has something of 
a dialogue about it, in that it impl ies a tacit agreement, a non-aggression 
pact, a contract, as it were, of non-violence . I t imposes reciprocity , and 
a communal i ty of use. In the street, each individual is supposed not to 
attack those he meets ; anyone who transgresses this law is deemed guilty 
of a criminal act. A space of this kind presupposes the ex istence of a 
'spatial economy' closely al l ied, though not identical , to the verbal 
economy. This economy valorizes certa in relat ionsh ips between people 
in particu lar places (shops, cafes, cinemas, etc. ) ,  and thus gives rise to 
connotative discourses concerning these places; these in turn generate 
'consensuses' or conventions according to which, for example, such and 
such a place is supposed to be trouble-free, a quiet area where people 
go peacefu l ly to have a good time, and so forth . As for denotative ( i .e. 
descriptive) discourses in this context, they have a quasi- legal aspect 
which also works for consensus: there is to be no fighting over who 
should occupy a particular spot; spaces are to be left free, and wherever 
possible al lowance is to be made for 'proxemics' - for the maintenance 
of ' respectfu l '  disrances. Th is attitude enta i l s in i ts turn a logic and a 



PLAN OF TH E l'R l::S E N T  W O R K  57 

strategy of pr_�perty in space : 'pl aces and things belonging to you do 
not belong to me' .  The fact remains, however, that communal or shared 
spaces, the possession or consumption of which cannot be ent irely 
privatized, continue to exist . Cafes, squares and monuments a re cases 
in point .  The spatial consensus I have j ust described in brief constitutes 
part of civi l ization much as do prohibitions against acts considered 
vulgar or offensive to ch i ldren, women, old people or  the publ ic in  
general .  Natural ly  enough, i t s  response to  class struggle, as to  other 
forms of violence, amounts to a formal and categorical rejection .  

Every space is a l ready i n  p lace before the appearance in it of actors ; 
these actors are col lective as wel l as individual subjects inasmuch as the 
individuals are always members of groups or classes seeking to appropri­
ate the space in question .  This pre-existence of space conditions the 
subject's presence, action and discourse, h is  competence and perform­
ance ;  yet the subject's presence, action and discourse, at the same time 
as they presuppose this space, a lso negate it . The subject experiences 
space as an obstacle, as a resistan t  'objecta lity' at t imes as implacably 
hard as a concrete wall , being not only extremely difficult to modify in 
any way but a lso hedged about by Draconian rules proh ibit ing any 
attempt at  such modification. Thus the texture of space affords oppor­
tunities not only to socia l  acts with no particu lar  p lace in it and no 
particul a r  l ink with it, but also to a spatial practice that i t  does indeed 
determine, namely its col lective and individual use: a sequence of acts 
which embody a sign i fying practice even i f  they cannot be reduced to 
such a practice. Life and death are not merely conceptual ized, s imulated 
or given expression by these acts ; rather, it is in  and through them that 
l ife and death actual ly have thei r being. It is within space that  time 
consumes or devours l iv ing beings, thus giving rea lity to sacrifice, p leas­
ure and pain. Abstract space, the space of the bourgeoisie and of 
capita l i sm, bound up as i t  i s  with exchange (of goods and commodities, 
as of written and spoken words, etc . )  depends on consensus more than 
any space before it .  It hardly seems necessary to add that within this 
space violence does not always remain la tent or h idden . One of its 
contradictions is that between the appearance of security and the con ­
stant threat, and indeed the occasional eruption, o f  violence. 

The old class struggle between bourgeoisie and aristocracy produced 
a space where the signs of that struggle are stil l manifest. Innumerable 
historic towns were transformed by that confl ict, whose traces and 
resu lts may eas i ly be seen .  After i ts  polit ical triumph i n  France, for 
example, the bourgeoisie smashed the a ristocratic space of the Marais 
district in the centre of Paris, pressing it into the service of materia l  



58  PLAN OF THE PRESENT WORK 

production and instal l ing workshops, shops and apartments in the luxur­
ious mansions of the area. Th is space was thus both ugl ified and 
enl ivened, in characteristi cally bourgeois fashion, th rough a process of 
'popularization ' .  Today, a second phase of bourgeoisification is proceed­
ing apace in the Marais, as it is reclaimed for residential purposes by 
the el ite. Th is is a good example of how the bourgeoisie can retain its 
in it iative in a great h istoric city. It also keeps rhe in itiative on a much 
wider sca le, of course. Consider, for instance, the way in which 'pol lut­
ing' industries are beginn ing to be exported to less developed countries 
- to Brazil in the case of America, or to Spain in  the European context. 
It is worth noting that such trends bring about d ifferentiarion within a 
given mode of production. 

A remarkable instance of the production of space on the basis of a 
difference internal to the dominant mode of production is supplied by 
the current transformation of the perimeter of the Mediterranean in to 
a leisure-oriented space for industrial ized Europe. As such, and even in 
a sense as a 'non-work' space (set aside not just for vacations but a lso 
for convalescence, rest, retirement, and so on ) ,  this area has acquired a 
speci fic role in the socia l  division of labour. Economica l ly  and socia l ly ,  
architectura l ly  and urbanistica l ly ,  i t  has been subjected to a sort of neo­
colonization. At times this space even seems to transcend the constra ints 
imposed by the neocapital ism which governs i t :  the use to wh ich it has 
been put calls for 'ecologica l '  v irtues such as an immediate access to 
sun and sea and a close juxtaposition of urban centres and temporary 
accommodation (hotels, v i l las, etc. ) .  It has thus atta ined a certain qual i ­
tat ive distinctiveness as compared with the major industr ia l  agglomer­
ations, where a pure culture of the quantitative reigns supreme. I f, by 
abandoning all our critical faculties, we were to accept th is 'distinc­
tiveness' at face value, we would get a mental picture of a space given 
over completely to unproductive expense, to a vast wastefu lness, to an 
intense and gigantic potlatch of surplus objects, symbols and energies, 
with the accent on sports, love and reinvigoration rather than on rest 
and relaxation. The quasi-cul tist focus of loca l ities based on leisure 
would thus form a striking contrast to the productive focus of North 
Eu ropean cities. The waste and expense, meanwhile, would appear as 
the end-poin t  of a temporal sequence starting in the workplace, in 
production-based space, and leading to the consumption of space, sun 
and sea, and of spontaneous or induced eroticism, in a great 
'vacationland festival ' .  Waste and expense, then, instead of occurring at 
the beginn ing, as inaugurating events, would come at the end of the 
sequence, giving it meaning and justification . What a travesty such a 



P L A N  Of T H E  PRESENT W O R K  59  

picture would be, however, ensh rining a s  i t  does both the i l l usion o f  
transparency a n d  the i l l usion o f  natural ness. The truth is  that a l l  this 
seemingly non-productive expense is planned with the grea test care : 
centra l ized, organized, h ierarchized, symbolized and programmed to the 
nth degree, it serves the interests of the tour-operators, bankers and 
entrepreneurs of places such as London and Hamburg. To be more 
precise, and to use the terminology introduced earl ier :  in the spatia l  
practice of neocapital ism (complete with a i r  transport ) ,  representations 
of space faci l i tate the manipulation of representational spaces (sun, sea, 
fest ival ,  waste, expense) .  

There a re two reasons for bringing these considerations u p  at this 
point: to make the notion of the production of space as concrete as 
possible right away, and to show how the class struggle is waged under 
the hegemony of the bourgeoisie. 

xx 

'Change l ife ! '  'Change society ! '  These precepts mean noth ing without 
the p�oduction of an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from the 
Sovie_t constructivists of 1 920-30, and from their fai lure, is  that new 
soci�I relationships ca l l  for a new space, and vice versa . This  proposi tion, 
which is a coro l lary of our initial one, wi l l  need to be discussed at some 
length. The in junction to change l i fe originated with the poets and 
philosophers, in the context of a negative utopian ism, but i_t__�as recently 
fal len into the public ( i .e . the political )  domain . In the process- ·it- h-as 
degenerated into polit ica l  slogans - 'Live better ! ' , ' Live di fferently ! ' ,  'the 
quality of l i fe ' ,  ' l i festyle' - whence i t  is but a short step to ta lk  of 
pol lution, of respect for nature and for the environment, and so forth . 
The pressure of the world market, the transformation of the planet, the 
production of a new space - a l l  these have thus disappeared into th in  
a i r .  What we a re left with, so far from implying the creation, whether 
gradual or sudden, of a d i fferent spatia l  practice, is simply the return 
of an idea to an ideal state. So long as everyday l i fe remains in thrall 
to abstract space, with its very concrete constraints; so long as the 
only improvements to occu r a re technical improvements of detai l  (for 
example, the frequency and speed of transportation, or relatively better 
amenities ) ;  so long, in  short, as the only connection between work 
spaces, leisure spaces and l iving spaces is suppl ied by the agencies of 
political power and by their mechanisms of control - so long must the 
project of 'changing l i fe '  remain no more than a poli tical ra l ly ing-cry to 



60 P L A N  OF TH E PRESENT WO R K  

be taken up or abandoned according to  the  mood of the moment. 
Such are the c i rcumstances under wh ich theoretical thought  must 

labour as i t  attempts to negotiate the obstacles in its path. To one side, 
i t  perceives the abyss of negative utopias, the vanity of a critical theory 
which works only at the level of words and ideas ( i . e .  at the ideological 
leve l ) .  Turning in the opposi te direction, it confronts h ighly positive 
technologica l utopias :  the rea lm of 'prospectivism',  of social engineering 
and programming. Here it must of necess i ty take note of the application 
to space - and hence to existing social relationships - of cybernetics, 
electronics and information science, i f  only in  order to draw lessons 
from these developments. 

The path I shall be outl in ing here is thus bound up with a stra tegic 
hypotht:�is - that is to say, with a long-range theoretical and practical 
proiect.A.re we talk ing about a pol itica l  p roject ? Yes and no. It certa in ly 
embodies a politics of space, but at the same time goes beyond polit ics (1 inasmuch as i t  presupposes a critical ana lysis of all spatial poli tics as of 
all pol it ics i n  genera l .  By seeking to poin t  the way towards a d i fferent \ 

1. space, towards the space of a different (socia l )  l i fe and of a di fferent 
mode of production, this project straddles the breach between science 
and utopia,  rea l i ty and ideality, conceived and l ived. It aspi res to sur­
mount these oppositions by exploring the dia lectical relationship 
between 'possi ble' and ' impossible' ,  and this both objectively and subjec­
tively. 

The role of strategic hypotheses in  the construction of knowledge is 
well established. A hypothesis of this k ind serves to centre knowledge 
a round a particu lar focal point, a kernel, a concept or a group of 
concepts. The strategy involved may succeed or fa i l ;  i n  any case i t  wil l  
last for a fin i te length of time, long or short, before dissolving or 
spl itt ing. Thus, no matter how long i t  may continue to govern tactical 
operations in  the fields of knowledge and action, i t  must rema in  essen­
t ia l ly temporary - and hence subject to revision . It demands commit­
ment, yet appeals to no eternal truths. Sooner or later, the basis of 
even the most successful strategy must crumble. At which point, the 
concomitant removal of the centre wi l l  topple whatever has been set in 
place around it .  

In  recent times, a series of tactical and strategic operations have been 
undertaken with a view to the establishment (the word is apt) of a sort 
of impregnable fortress of knowledge. With a curious blend of naivety 
and cunning, the learned promoters of such movements always express 
the conviction that their claims are of an i rrefutably scientific nature, 
whi le at the same time ignoring the questions ra ised by a l l  such claims 



PLAN OF TH E PRESENT W O R K  6 1  

to scientific status, and especial ly the question o f  the justification for 
assign ing priority co what is known or seen over what is lived. The most 
recent strategic operation of this kind has sought to centre knowledge on 
l ingu istics and i ts anc i l lary discip l ines :  semantics, semiology, sem iotics. 
(Earlier efforts had given a comparable central ity to polit ical economy, 
h i story, sociology ,  and so on . )  

Th is most recent hypothesis has given rise to  a great mass of research 
and publ ication . Some of this work is  of great importance; some of it 
is  no doubt over- or underestimated. Natural ly all such j udgements, 
having noth ing eternal about them, are subject to revision. But, inasmuch 
as the hypothesis itself is based on the shaky assumption that a defin i te 
(and definit ive) centre can be establ i shed, it is l ikely to col lapse. Indeed, 
i t  is  a l ready th reatened with destruction from within and from without. 
Internally, i t  raises questions tha t  it  cannot answer. The question of the 
subject is  a case in  point. The systematic study of language, and/or the 
study of l anguage as a system, have e l iminated the 'subject' in every 
sense of the term . This is the sorr of situation where reflective thinking 
must pick up the pieces of  its broken mi rror. Lacking a 'subject' of i ts 
own, i t  seizes on the old 'subjects' of the phi losophers. Thus we find 
Chomsky readopting Desca rtes's cogito and i ts unique characteristics : 
the un icity of the deep structures of discourse and the genera l i ty of the 
field of consciousness. Witness a lso the reappearance of the Husserl ian 
Ego, a modernized version of the cogito, but one which cannot mainta in 
i t s  phi losophical (or meta-physica l )  substantia l i ty - especia l ly i n  face of 
that unconscious which was i ndeed invented as a way of escaping from 
it. 

Which brings us back to an earl ier part of our discussion, for what 
this hypothesis does is cheerfu l ly  commandeer socia l  space and physical 
space and reduce them to an  epistemological (menta l )  space - the space 
of discourse and of the Cartesian cogito. It is conveniently forgotten 
that the practical ' I ' ,  which is inseparably individual and socia l ,  i s  in  a 
space where it must either recognize itsel f or lose itse lf. Th is unconsid­
ered leap from the mental to the social and back again  effectively 
transfers the properties of space proper onto the level of discourse -
and particularly onto the level of discourse upon space. It is true that  
this approach seeks to supply some mediation between mental and social' 

by evoking the body (voice, gestures, etc. ) .  But one may wonder what 
connection exists between this abstract body, understood simply as a 
mediation between 'subject' and 'object ' ,  and a practica l and fleshy body 
conceived of as a total ity complete with spatia l  qua l i ties (symmetries, 
asymmetries) and energetic properties (d ischarges, economies, waste ) .  In 



62 PLAN OF THE PRESENT WORK 

fact, as I shal l  show later, the moment the body is envisioned as 
a practico-sensory total ity, a decentring and recentring of knowledge 
occurs. 

The strategy of centring knowledge on discourse avoids the particu­
larly scabrous topic of the relationship between knowledge and power.  
It is also incapable of supplying reflective thought with a satisfactory 
answer to a theoretical question that i t  raises i tself: do sets of non­
verbal s igns and symbols,  whether coded or not, systematized or not, 
fa l l  in to the same category as verbal sets, or are they rather irreducible 
to them ? Among non-verbal sign i fying sets must be included music, 
pa inting, sculpture, archi tecn1re, and certain ly theatre, which in addition 
to a text or p retext embraces gesture, masks, costume, a stage, a mise­
en-scene - in short, a space. Non-verbal sets are thus characterized by 
a spat ia l i ty which is in fact i rreducible to the mental realm.  There is 
even a sense in which landscapes, both rural and urban, fal l  under th is 
head. To underestimate, ignore and diminish space amounts to the 
overestimation of  texts, written matter, and writing systems, a long with 
the readable and the visible, to the point of assigning to these a monopoly 
on intel l igib i l i ty .  

S imply stated, the strategic hypothesis proposed here runs  as fol lows. 

Theoretical and practical questions relating to space are becoming 
more and more important. These questions, though they do not 
suppress them, tend to resituate concepts and problems having to 
do with biological reproduction, and with the production both of 
the means of  production themselves and of  consumer goods. 

A given mode of production does not d isappear, according to Marx,  
unti l  it has l i berated the forces of production and rea l ized i t s  ful l  
potent ia l .  This assertion may be  viewed either as a statement of the 
obvious or as a striking paradox. When the forces of production make 
a leap forward, but the capita list relations of production remain intact, 
the production of space itself replaces - or, rather, is superimposed 
upon - the production of things in space. In a number of observable 
and analysable instances, at any rate, such a production of space i tself 
is entai led by the pressure of the world market and the reproduction of 
the capitalist relations of production . Through their manipulation of 
abstract space, the bourgeoisie's enl ightened despotism and the capitalist 
system have successfu l ly establ ished partial control over the commodity 
market. They have found it harder - witness their 'monetary' problems 
- to establish control over the capital market itsel f. The combined result 



P L A N  OF T H E  PR ESENT W O R K  63 

of a very strong political hegemony, a surge in the forces of production, 
and an inadequate control of markets, is a spati a l  chaos experienced at 
the most parochia l  level j ust as on a worldwide scale .  The bourgeoisie 
and the capital ist system thus experience great difficulty in mastering 
what is a t  once their product and the tool of their mastery, namely 
space. They find themselves unable to reduce practice (the practico­
senso'ry rea lm, the body, social-spatial practice) to thei r abstract space, 
and hence new, spatial ,  contradictions a rise and make themselves felt .  
Might not the spatial chaos enge.ndered by capital ism, despite the power 
and rational ity of the state, turn out to be the system's Ach i l les' heel ? 

The question natural ly arises whether this strategic hypothesis can in 
any way influence or supplant such genera l ly accepted polit ical strategies 
as world revolution carried through political ly by a single party, in a 
single country, under the guidance of a s ingle doctrine, through the 
efforts of  a single class - in a word, from a single centre. The crisis of 
al l  such 'monocentric' strategies cleared the way not so long ago, i t  wil l  
be recal led, for another strategic hypothesis, one based on the idea of 
a social transformation accomplished by the 'third world ' .  

In actua l i ty ,  i t  cannot be a matter merely of dogmatical ly substituting 
one of these hypotheses for another, nor simply of transcending the 
opposition between 'monocentric' and 'polycentric' . The earthshaking 
transformation ha l lowed in common parlance by the term ' revolution' 
has turned out to be truly earthshaking in that it is worldwide,36 and 
hence also, necessari ly, manifold and multiform. I t  advances on the 
theoretical as well as the political plane, for in i t  theory is immanent to 
politics. I t  progresses hand in hand with technology j ust as with knowl­
edge and practice. In  some situations peasants will remain, as they have 
long been, the principal factor, active and/or passive. In  others, that 
factor may be supplied by marginal social elements or by an advanced 
sector of the working class now disposing of an unprecedented range 
of options .  There are p laces where the transformation of the world may 
take on a violent and precipitate character, while in others i t  wil l  
progress i n  subterranean fash ion, way below an apparently tranqui l  or 
pacified surface. A particular  rul ing class may succeed in presiding over 
changes capable of utterly destroying its opposite numbers elsewhere. 

The strategic hypothesis based on space excludes neither the role of 
the so-called 'underdeveloped' countries nor that of the industrial ized 
nations and their working classes. To the contrary, its basic principle and 

' ·  3' This is noc ro say rhat i t  i s reducible ro what Kosras Axelos, in his long phi losophical !llednauon in the Heracl i tean mould, refers ro as the 'game of the world' .  



64 PLAN O f  THE PRESENT W O R K  

objective is the bringing-together of dissociated aspects, the unification of 
disparate tendencies and factors . Inasmuch as i t  tries to take the p lanet­
ary experiment in  which human i ty is engaged for what i t  is - that  is  to 
say, a series of separate and distinct assays of the world's space - this 
hypothesis sets i tse lf  up in clear opposit ion to the homogenizing efforts 
of the state, of polit ical power, of the world market, and of the com­
modity world - tendencies which find the ir  practical expression through 
and in abstract space. I t  impl ies the mobi l ization of differences in a 
single movement ( including di fferences o f  natural origin ,  each of which 
ecology tends to emphasize in isolation } :  di fferences of regime, country, 
location, ethnic group, natural resources, and so on. 

One might suppose that l i ttle argument would be requ i red to establ ish 
that the ' right to be d ifferent' can only have meaning when it is  based 
on actual struggles to establish di fferences and that the di fferences 
generated th rough such theoretical and practical struggles must them­
selves differ both from natural distinguishing characteristics and from 
differentiations induced within exist ing abstract space.  The fact remains 
that the d ifferences which concern us, those di fferences upon whose 
future strength theory and action may count, can only be effect ively 
demonstrated by dint of laborious ana lysis. 

The reconstruction of  a spatial 'code' - that is, of a language common 
to practice and theory, as also to inhabitants, a rchitects and scientists 
- may be considered from the practical point of view to be an immediate 

l task. The first thing such a code would do is recapture the unity of 
d issociated elements, breaking down such barriers as that between pr i -
vate and publ ic, and identifying both confluences and oppositions in 
space that a re at p resent indiscern ib le .  I t  would thus br ing together 
levels and terms which a re isolated by existing spatia l  practice and by 
the ideologies underp inn ing it: the 'micro' or architectural level and the 
'macro' level currently treated as the province of urbanists, polit icians 
and planners; the everyday rea lm and the urban rea lm ;  inside and 
outside; work and non-work ( festival ) ;  the durable and the ephemera l ;  
and  so forth . The code would therefore comprise significant oppositions 
( i .e .  paradigmatic elements) to be found amidst seemingly disparate 
terms, and l inks (syntagmatic elements} retrieved from the seemingly 
homogeneous mass of politica l ly  controlled space. In  this sense the code 
might be said to contribute to the reversal of the dominant tendency 
and thus to p lay a role in the overal l  project. I t  is v i ta l ,  however, that 
the code itse lf  not be mistaken for a practice. The search for a l anguage 
must therefore in no circumstances be permitted to become detached 



PLAN OF TH E PRESENT W O R K  65 

from practice or from the changes wrought by practice (i.e. from the 
worldwide process of transformation ) .  

The working-our of the  code cal ls i tsel f for an effort to  stay within 
the paradigmatic sphere: that is, the sphere of essential ,  hidden, implicit 
and unstated oppositions - opposit ions susceptible of orienting a social 
practice - as opposed to the sphere of expl ic i t  relations, the sphere of 
the operational l inks between terms; in  short, the syntagmatic sphere of 
language, ordinary discourse, writ ing, reading, l i tera ture, and so on. 

A code o f  th is k ind must be correlated with a system of knowledge. 
It br ings an alphabet, a lexicon and a grammar together with i n  an 
overa l l  framework;  and it situates i tself - though not in such a way as 
to excl ude it - vis-a-vis non-knowledge ( ignorance or misunderstanding) ; 
in other words, vis-a-vis the lived and the perceived. Such a knowledge 
is conscious of its own approximativeness :  it is at once certain and 
uncerta in .  I t  announces its own relativity at  each step, undertaking (or 
at least seeking to undertake) self-criticism, yet never al lowing itsel f to 
become dissipated in apologias for non-knowledge, absolute spontaneity 
or 'pure' v iolence. This knowledge must find a middle path between 
dogmatism on the one hand and the abdication of understanding on the 
other. 

XXI 

The approach taken here may be described as ' regressive-progressive'. 
It takes as its starting-point  the real ities of the present :  the forward leap 
of productive forces, and the new technical and scientific capacity to 
transform natu ra l  space so radica l ly that it threatens nature itself. The 
effects of this destructive and constructive power are to be fel t  on a l l  
sides ; they enter into combinations, often in a larming ways, with the 
pressures of the world market. With in this global framework, as might 
be expected, the Leninist principle of uneven development appl ies in full 
force : some countries are sti l l  in the earl iest stages of the production of 
things (goods) in space, and only the most industrial ized and u rbanized 
ones can exploit to the fu ll the new possibi l i ties opened up by technology 
and knowledge. The production of space, having attained the conceptual 
and linguistic level ,  acts retroactively upon the past,  disclosing aspects 
a_nd moments of it h i therto uncomprehended. The past appears in a 
different l ight, and hence the process whereby that past becomes the 
present also takes on another aspect.

This modus operandi is a lso the one which Marx proposed in his 
chief 'methodologica l '  text. The categories (concepts) which express 
social relationsh ips in the most advanced society, namely bourgeois

Though it may seem paradoxica l a t  first sight, this method appears 
on closer i nspection to be fa irly sensi ble. For how could we come to 
understand a genesis, the genesis of the present, along with the precon­
dit ions and processes involved, other than by starting from that present, 
working our way back to the past and then retracing our steps?  Surely 
this must be the method adopted by any h istorian,  economist or sociol­
ogist - assuming, of  course, that such special ists aspire to any method­
ology at a l l .  

Though perfectly clear i n  i ts formulation and appl ication, Marx's 
approach does have its problems, and they become apparent as soon as 
he appl ies his method to the concept and real i ty of  labour. The main 
d ifficu l ty ar ises from the fact that the 'regressive' and the 'progressive' 
movements become intertwined both in the exposition and in the 
research procedure itsel f. There is a constant risk of the regressive phase 
telescoping into the p rogressive one, so interrupting or obscuring it .  The 
beginn ing might then appear at the end, and the outcome might emerge 
at the outset. A l l  of which serves to add an extra level of complex ity to 
the uncovering of those contradictions which drive every historical 
p rocess forward - and thus (according to Marx )  towards its end. 

This is indeed the very problem which confronts us in the present 
context. A new concept, that of the production of space, appears at the 
start ;  i t  must 'operate' or 'work' in  such a way as to shed l ight on 
processes from which it cannot separate itse l f  because i t  is a product of 
them. Our task, therefore, is to employ this concept by giving it free 
rein  without for a l l  that according it, after the fashion of the Hegel ians,

a l i fe and strength of i ts  own qua concept - without, in other words, 
according an autonomous rea l i ty to knowledge. Ultimately, once it 
has i l luminated and thereby val idated its own coming-into-being, the 
production of space (as theoretical concept and practical rea l ity in 
indissoluble conjunction) will become clear, and our demonstration will 
be over: we sha l l  have arrived at a truth 'in itsel f and for itself', complete 
and yet rel ative. 

In th is way the method can become progressively more dialectical 
without posing a threat to logic and consistency. Not that there i s  no 
danger of fa l l ing into obscurity or, especia l ly, into repetitiousness. Marx 
certainly fa iled to avoid such risks completely. And he was very aware 
of them : witness the fact that the exposition i n  Capital by no means 
fo l lows exactly the method set forth in the Grundrisse; Marx's great 
doctrinal dissertation starts off from a form, that of exchange value, 
and not from the concepts brought to the fore in the earl ier work, namely 
production and labour. On the other hand, the approach adumbrated in 
the Grundrisse is taken up again apropos of the accumulation of capital :  
i n  England, studying the most advanced form o f  capitalism in order to 
understand the system in other countries and the process of its actua l  
growth, Marx cleaved firmly to his init ial methodologica l precepts.

Social Space 

I 

Our project calls for a very carefu l  examination of the notions and 
terminology involved, especia l ly since the expression ' the production of 
space' comprises two terms neither of which has ever been properly 
clarified. 

I n  _ _  lj�gel ian ism, 'p.ro<;luction' has a cardinal  role: fi rst, the (absolute) 
Idea produces the world ; next, nature p roduces the human being; and 
the human being in turn, by dint of struggle and labour, produces at 
once h istory,  knowledge and sel f-consciousness - and hence that Mind 
which reproduces the in it ial and ult imate Idea.  

For Marx and Engels, the concept of production never emerges from 
the ambiguity which makes it such a ferti le idea . It has two senses, one 
very broad, the other restrictive and precise. I n  its broad sense, humans 
as socia l  beings are said to produce thei r  own l ife, their  own conscious­
ness, their O\\'.n world. There is nothing, in  h istory or in society, w_hjch 
does noi: have to be achieved and produced. 'Natu re' itse lf, as apprehen­
ded in social life by the sense organs, has been modified and therefore 
in a sense produced. Human beings have produced j u ridical, pol it ical , 
rel igious, a rtistic and ph ilosophica l  forms. Thus production in the broad 
sense of  the term embraces a multiplicity of works and a great diversity 
of forms, even forms that do not bear the stamp of the producer or of 
the production process (as is the case with the logical form:  an abstract 
form which can easily be perceived as a temporal and therefore non­
produced - that is, metaphysica l ) .  

Neither Marx nor Engels leaves the concept of production in  an  
indeterminate state of th i s  k ind .  They narrow i t  down, but  with the 
result  that works in the broad sense are no longer part of the picture ; 



SOCI A L  SPACE 69 

what they have in mind is things only :  products. This narrowing of  the 
concept brings it closer to its everyday, and hence banal ,  sense - the 
sense it has for the economists. As for the question of who does the 
producing, and how they do it, the more restricted the notion becomes 
the less it connotes creativity, inventiveness or imagination ;  rather, it 
tends to refer solely to labour. ' I t  was an immense step forward for 
Adam Smith co th row out every l imit ing specification of wealth-creating 
;ctivity [and co consider only] labour in genera l .  With the abstract 
un iversa l i ty of  wealth-creating activity we now have the un iversal i ty of 
the object defined as wealth, the product as such or again labour as 
such . > 1  Production, product, labour:  these th ree concepts, which 
emerge s imultaneously and lay the foundation for political economy, 
are abstractions with a special status, concrete abstractions that make 
possible the relations of production . So far as the concept of production 
is concerned, it does not become fully concrete or take on a true content 
unti l replies have been given to the questions that it makes possible :  
'Who produces ? ' ,  'What? ' ,  'How ?' ,  'Why and for whom ? '  Outside the 
context o f  these questions and their answers, the concept of production 
remains purely abstract. In  Marx, as in Engels,  the concept never atta ins 
concreteness. ( I t  is true that ,  very late on, Engels at his most economistic 
sought to confine the notion to its narrowest possible meaning: ' the 
ultimately determining element in h istory is the production and repro­
duction of real l i fe ' ,  he wrote in a letter to Bloch on 2 1  September 1 890. 
This sentence is at  once dogmatic and vague : production is said to 
subsume biologica l ,  economic and social reproduction, and no further 
clarification is forthcoming. ) 

What constitutes the forces of production, according to Marx and 
Engels ? Nature, first of a l l ,  p lays a pa rt, then labour, hence the organiz­
ation (or division) of labour, and hence also the instruments of labour, 
including technology and, u l timately, knowledge. 

Since the time of Marx and Engels the concept of production has 
come to be used so very loosely that it has lose practica l ly al l  definit ion. 
We speak of  the production of knowledge, or ideologies, or writings 
and mean ings, of images, of  discourses, of language, of signs and sym­
bols; and, s imi larly, of 'dream-work' or of  the work of 'operational '  
concepts, and so on.  Such is the extension of these concepts that their 
comprehension has been seriously eroded. What makes matters worse 
is tha t  the authors of such extensions of meaning qui te consciously

abuse a procedure which Marx and Engels used ingenuously, endowing 
the broad or phi losophical sense of the concepts with a posit ivity prop­
erly belonging to the na rrow or scientific (economic) sense. 

There is thus every reason to take up these concepts once more, to 
try and restore their value and to render them dialectica l, while 
attempting to Ckfine-·with some degree of rigour the rela tionship between 
'production ' and 'product', as l ikewise those between 'works' and 'prod­
ucts' and 'nature '  and 'production' It may be pointed out right away 
that, whereas a work has something i rreplaceable and unique about it, 
a product can be reproduced exactly, and is in fact the result of repetitive 
acts and gestures. Nature creates and does not produce; it provides 
resources for a creative and productive activity on the part of social 
humanity; but it suppl ies only use value, and every use value - that is 
to say, any product inasmuch as i t  is not exchangeable - either returns 
to nature or serves as a natural good. The earth and nature cannot, of 
course, be divorced from each other. 

Why do I say that nature does not produce ? The original meaning of 
the word suggests the contrary : to lead out and forward, to br ing forth 
from the depths .  And yet, n<!_ture _d�_not lab()ur:  it is even one -9-Lits 
defining characteristics that it creates. �_atitcr.e.ates, namely indiridual 
'beings'., s imply surges forth, s imply aQpears .  Nature knows nothing of 
these creations - unless one is prepared to postu late the existence within 
it of a calculating god or providence. A tree, a flower or a fruit is not 
a 'product'_- even if it is in a garden . A

i t  blooms b_ecau!e i t  blooms. In i:ne words of Angelus Si lesius, it

- ·'cares 
not whether i t  is seen ' .  It does not know that i t  is beautiful, that it 
smells good, that i t  embodies a symmetry of  the nth order. It is surely 
almost impossible not to pursue further or to return to such questions. 
'Nature' cannot operate according to the same teleology as human 
beings. The 'beings' it creates are works ;  and each has 'something' 
unique about it even if  it belongs to a genus and a species : a tree is  a 
particular  tree, a rose a particu lar rose, a horse a particular  horse. 
Nature appears as the vast territory of  births. 'Thin&s' are born,_grow 
and rip�hen wither and-die. The reality behind these words is infinite. 
As it deploys its forces, nature is violent, generous, n iggardly, bountiful ,  
and above all open. Nature's space is not staged . To ask why this i s  so 
is a strictly meaningless question :  a flower does not know that i t  i s  a 
flower any more than death knows upon whom it is vis ited. If we a re to 
believe the word 'natu re' ,  with its ancient metaphysical and theological 
credentials, what is essential occurs in the depths. To say 'natural '  is to 
say spont;ineo�s.  But today nature is drawing away fr�m us,tt>" sayrhe

very least. I t  is becqming impossible to  escape the notion that  nature i s  
being murdered by 'anti-nature' - by  abstraction, by  signs and  images, 
by discourse, as also by labour and its products. A[Qng witlLG.od...n;i_�re 
is..dying. 'Human ity' is ki l l ing both of them - and perhaps committing 
suicide in to the bargain .  

Huma_n_i ty, which is to say social practice, creates works and produces 
things.

- in either case labour is called for, but in the case of works the 
part played by labour (and by the creator qua labourer) seems secondary, 
whereas i n  the manufacture of products it predominates. 

In  clari fying the phi losophical (Hegel ian) concept of production, and 
cal l ing for this purpose upon the economists and pol itical economy, 
Marx was seeking a rational ity immanent to that concept and to its 
content ( i . e .  activity ) .  A rational i ty so conceived would release him from 
any need to evoke a pre-existing reason of divine or ' idea l '  (hence 
theologica l and metaphysica l )  origin. I t  would also el iminate any sugges­
tion of a goal governing productive activity and conceived of as preced­
ing and outlasting that activity. Production in the Marxist sense tran­
scends the phi losoph ical opposition between 'subject' and 'object', along 
with a l l  the relationsh ips constructed by the phi losophers on the basis 
of that opposit ion.  How, then, is the rationa lity immanent t-9 produqign 
to be defined ? By the fact, first of  al l ,  that i t  organizes a sequence of 
act!Qns with a certa in 'objective' ( i .e .  the object to be £_rcxiucedf� 
It imposes a temporal and spatial order upon related operations whose 
results are coextensive. From the start of an activity so oriented towards 
an objective, spatial elements - the body, l imbs, eyes - are mobi l ized, 
including both materials (stone, wood, bone, leather, etc . )  and materiel 
( tools, arms, language, instructions and agendas) .  Relations based on an 
order to be fol lowed - that is to say, on simultaneityand synchronicicy ­
"!re th�s set up, by means of intel lectual activity, between the component 
ele�ents of  the action undertaken on.the ?h¥sical plane. Al l  productive 
activ ity is defined less by invariable or constant factors than by the 
incessant to-and- fro between temporality (succession, concatenation) 
and spati al ity (s imultaneity, synchronicity ) .  Th is form is insepa rable 
fro!ll orientation towards a goa l  - and thus also from functional ity fthe 
end and meaning of the action, the energy uti l ized for the sati sfacti<:5II 
of a ' need' )  and from tb_e structure set in motion (know-how-, skills, 
gestures and co-operation in work, etc. ) .  The formal relationships which 
a llow separate actions to forma coherent whole cannot be detached 
from the material preconditions of  individual and collective act ivity; 
and this holds true whether the aim is to move a rock, to hunt game, 
or to make a simple or complex object. The rationality of  space, accord- \

ing to this ana lysis, is not the outcome of a qual ity or property of 
human action in  genera l ,  or human labou r as such, of 'man', or of social 
organization. On the contrary, it is itsel f the origin and source - not 
distantly but immediately , or rather inherently - of the rational ity of 
activ ity;  an origin which is concealed by, yet at the same time implicit 
in ,  the inevitable empiricism of those who use their hands and tools, 
who adjust and combine their gestures and direct their energies as a 
function of specific  casks. 

By and la rge, the concept of production is sti l l  that same 'concrete 
universa l '  which Marx described on the basis of Hegel's thinking, 
a l though it has since been somewhat obscured and watered down.  Th is 
fact has indeed been the justification offered for a number of critica l 
appraisals .  Only a very s l ight effort is made, however, to veil the tactical 
a im of such criticisms: the l iqu idation of this concept, of Marxist 
concepts in general ,  and hence of the concrete universal as such, in 
favour of the general ization of the abstract and the unreal istic in  a sort 
of wi lfu l  da l l iance with n ih i l ism. 2 

On the right, so to speak, the concept of production can scarcely be 
separated out from the ideology of productivism, from a crude and 
brutal  economism whose aim is to annex it for i ts own purposes. On 
the other hand, i t  must be said, in response to the left-wing or ' leftist' 
notion that words, dreams, texts and concepts labour and produce on 
their own account, that this leaves us with a curious image of labour 
without labourers, p roducts without a production process or production 
without products, and works without creators ( no 'subject' - and no 
'object' either ! ) .  The phrase 'production of knowledge' does make a 
certa in amount of sense so far as the development of concepts is coh­
cerned : every concept must come into being and must matu re. But 
without the facts, and without the discourse of social beings or 'subjects', 
who could be said to produce concepts ? There is a point beyond which 
rel iance on such formulas as 'the production of  knowledge' leads onto 
very treacherous ground:  knowledge may be conceived of on the model 
of industrial production, with the result  that the existing division of 
labour and use of machines, especia l ly  cybernetic machines, is  uncriti­
cal l y  accepted ; a l ternatively, the concept of production as wel l  as the 
concept of knowledge may be deprived of all specific content, and this 
from the point of view of the 'object' as well as from that of the

irrational ism.

sump.tion �i .e .  the enjoyment of the fruits of production ) .  Social space 
implies a great diversity of knowledge. What then is its exact status ?  
And what i s  the nature o f  its rel ationship to production ? 

'To produce space' : this combination of words would have meant 
strictly n0thingwlien the phi losophers exercised a l l  power over concepts. 
The space of the phi losophers could be created only by God, as his first  
wo;k; th is  is as true for the God of the Cartesians (Descartes, Malebran­
che, Spinoza, Leibniz)  as for the Absolute of the post-Kantians (Schel l ing, 
Fichte, Hegel ) .  Although, later on, space began to appear as  a mere 
degradation of 'being' as i t  unfolded in a temporal continuum, this 
pejorative view made no basic d ifference : though relativ ized and deva­
lued, space continued to depend on the absolute, or upon duration in 
the Bergsonian sense. 

Consider the case of a city - a space which is fash ioned, shaped and 
invested by social  activities during a finite h istorical period . ls th is city 
a work or a product? Take Venice, for instance. I f  we define works as 
un ique, original and primordial ,  as occupying a space yet associated 
with a particu lar  time, a time of maturity between rise and decl ine, then 
Venice can only be described as a work. It is a space just as highly  
expressive and significant, j ust as unique and unified as a painting or a 
sculpture. But what - and whom - does it express and sign i fy ?  These 
questions can give rise to interminable discussion, for here content and 
meaning have no l imits. Happily, one does not have to know the 
answers, or to be a 'connoisseur' ,  in  order to experience Venice as 
festiva l .  Who conceived the arch itectural and monumental unity which 
extends from each palazzo to the city as a whole ? The truth is that no 
one did - even though Venice, more than any other place, bears witness 
to the existence, from the sixteenth century on, of a unitary code or 
common language of the city. This unity goes deeper, and in a sense 



74 S O C I A L  SPACE 
h igher, than the spectacle Venice offers the tourist. It combines the city's 
real i ty with its ideal i ty, embracing the practical ,  the symbolic and the 
imaginary. In Venice, the representation of space (the sea at once domi­
nated and exal ted) and representational space (exquisite l ines, refined 
pleasures, the sumptuous and cruel dissipation of weal th accumulated 
by any and every means) are mutual ly reinforcing. Something s imi lar 
may be said of  the space of the canals and streets, where water and 
stone create a texture founded on reciprocal reflection. Here everyday 
l i fe and its functions are coextensive with, and utterly transformed by, 
a theatricality as sophisticated as it is unsought, a sort of involuntary 
mise-en-scene. There is even a touch of madness added for good measure. 

But the moment of  creation is past;  indeed, the city's disappearance 
is  a l ready imminent. Precisely because i t  is sti l l  ful l  of l i fe, though 
threatened with extinction, this work deeply  a ffects anyone who uses it 
as a source o f  pleasure and in so doing contributes in  however small a 
measu re to its demise. The same thing goes for a v i l lage, or for a fine 
vase. These 'objects' occupy a space which is not produced as such . 
Th ink now of  a flower. 'A rose does not know that it is a rose. ' 3  
Obviously, a c i ty does not present itse l f  in the same way as a flower, 
ignorant of  its own beauty. It has, after a l l ,  been 'composed' by people, 
by wel l-defined groups. Al l  the same, it has none of  the intentional 
character of  an 'art object' .  For many people, to describe someth ing as 
a work of  art is s imply the highest praise imaginable. And yet, what a 
distance there is between a work of nature and a rt's intentional ity ! What 
exactly were the great cathedra ls ?  The answer is that they were political 
acts. The ancient function of  statues was to immortalize the dead so 
that they would not harm the l iv ing. Fabrics or vases served a purpose. 
One i s  tempted to say, in fact, that the appearance of art, a short time 
prior to the appearance of its concept, implies the degeneration of 
works :  that no work has ever been created as a work of art, and hence 
that a rt - especia l ly the art of writing, or l iterature - merely heralds 
tha t  decl ine. Cou ld it be that art, as a specia l ized activity, has destroyed 
works and replaced them, slowly but implacably, by products destined 
to be exchanged, traded and reproduced ad infinitum ? Could it be that 
the space of  the finest cities came into being after the fashion of  plants 
and flowers in a garden - after the fashion, in other words, of works 
of nature, j ust as unique as they, a lbeit fashioned by h ighly civi l ized 
people ?

The question is an important one. Can works rea l l y  be said to stand 
in a transcendent relationship to products ?  Can the historica l spaces of 
v i l lage and city be adequately dea l t  with solely by reference to the notion 
of a work ? Are we concerned here with col lectivities sti l l  so close to 
nature that the concepts of  production and product, and hence any idea 
of a 'production of space', are largely irrelevant to our understanding 
of them ? Is there not a danger here too of fetishizing the notion of 
the work, and so erecting un justified barriers between creation and 
production, nature and labour, festival and toi l ,  the unique and the 
reproducible, difference and repetit ion, and, ult imately, the l iving and 
the dead ? 

Another result  of such an approach would be to force a radical break 
between the historical and economic realms. There is no need to subject 
modern towns, their outski rts and new bui ldings, to careful scrutiny in  
order to  reach the conclusion that  everything here resembles everything 
else. The more or less accentuated spl it between what is known as 
'architecture' and what is known as 'urbanism' - that is to say, between 
the 'micro' and 'macro ' levels, and between these two areas of concern 
and the two professions concerned - has not resulted in an increased 
diversity. On the contrary. I t  is obvious, sad to say, that repetition has 
everywhere defeated un iqueness, that the artificial and contrived have 
driven a l l  spontaneity and naturalness from the field, and, in short, that 
products have vanquished works. Repetitious spaces are the outcome of 
repetitive gestures ( those of the workers) associated with instruments 
which a re both dupl icatable and designed to duplicate: machines, bul l­
dozers, concrete-mixers, cranes, pneumatic dri l ls, and so on. Are these 
spaces interchangeable because they are homologous?  Or are they homo­
geneous so that they can be exchanged, bought and sold, with the 
only di fferences between them being those assessable in money - i .e .  
quantifiable - terms (as volumes, distances, etc. ) ?  At  a l l  events, repetition 
reigns supreme. Can a space of this kind rea l ly still be described as a 
'work' ? There is an overwhelming case for saying that it is a product 
strictu sensu: it is reproducible and it is the result of repetitive actions. 
Tilus space is undoubtedly produced even when the scale is not that of 
major h ighways, a i rports or publ ic works. A further important aspect 
of spaces of this kind is their increasingly pronounced visual character. 
They a re made with the visible in  mind:  the visibi l ity of people and 
things, of spaces and of whatever is contained by them. The predomi­
nance of visual ization (more important than 'spectacularization' ,  which 
is in any case subsumed by it )  serves to conceal repetitiveness. People 
look, and take sight, take seeing, for l i fe itself. We build on the basis 



76 SOCI A L  SPACE 

of papers and plans. We buy on the basis of images. Sight and seeing, 
which in the Western tradition once epitomized intel l igibi l i ty, have 
turned into a trap:  the means whereby, in socia l  space, divers i ty may 
be s imulated and a travesty of enl ightenment and intel l igibi l ity ensconced 
under the sign of transparency. 

Let us return now to the exemplary case of Venice. Venice is indeed 
1 a unique space, a true marvel . But is  it a work of art?  No, because it 
was not planned in advance. I t  was born of the sea, but gradual ly, and 
not, l ike Aphrodite, in an instant. To begin with, there was a challenge 
( to nature, to enemies) and an aim ( trade ) .  The space of the settlement 
on the l agoon, encompassing swamps, shal lows and outlets to the open 
sea , cannot be separated from a vaster space, that of a system of 
commercial exchange which was not yet worldwide but which took in 
the Mediterranean and the Orient. Another prerequisite of Venice's 
development was the continuity ensu red by a grand design, by an 
ongoing practical project, and by the dominance of a political caste, by 
the ' thalassocracy' of a merchant oligarchy. Beginning with the very 
first p i les driven into the mud of the lagoon,  every single site in  the city 
had of course to be planned and real ized by people - by political 'chiefs ' ,  
by groups supporting them, and by those who performed the work of 
construction itsel f. Closely beh ind practica l responses to the chal lenge 
of the sea ( the port, navigable channels) came publ ic gatherings, festivals, 
grandiose ceremonies (such as the marriage of the Doge and the sea) 
and architectural inventiveness. Here we can see the relationship between 
a p lace bui l t  by collective wi l l  and collective thought on the one hand, 
and the productive forces of the period on the other .  For this is a 
place that has been laboured on. Sinking pi l ings, bui lding docks and 
harbourside insta l lations, erecting palaces - these tasks also constituted 
socia l  labour, a labour carried out under d ifficult conditions and under 
the constraint of decisions made by a caste destined to profit from i t  in 
every way. Behind Venice the work, then, there assuredly lay production. 
Had not the emergence of social surplus production - a form preceding 
capital ist surplus value - already heralded th is state of things ? In the 
case of Venice, a rider must be added to the effect that the surplus 
labour and the social surplus production were not only real ized but also 
for the most part expanded on the spot - that is to say, in the city of  
Venice. The fact that  th i s  surplus production was put to an aesthetical ly 
satisfying use, in accordance with the tastes of people who were pro­
digiously gifted, and highly civi l ized for a l l  their ruth lessness, can in  no 
way conceal its origins .  All Venice's now-decl ining splendour reposes 



S O C I A L  SPACE 77 

after i ts fashion on ofr-repeated gestures on the part of carpenters and 
masons, sai lors and stevedores ; as a lso, of course, on those of patricians 
managing their affa i rs from day to day. Al l  the same, every bit of Venice 
is part of a great hymn to diversity in pleasure and inventiveness i n  
celebration, revelry and  sumptuous ritual .  I f  i ndeed there i s  a need a t  
a l l  t o  preserve the dist inction between works and  products, i ts import 
must be quite relative. Perhaps we shal l  discover a subtler relationsh ip 
between these two terms than e ither identity or opposition . Each work 
occupies a space; i t  also engenders and fashions that space. Each product 
too occupies a space, and ci rculates with in  it .  The question is therefore 
what relat ionship might exist between these two modalities of occupied 
space. 

Even in Venice, social space is produced and reproduced in  connection 
with the forces of production (and with the relations of production) .  
And these forces, as they develop, are not  taking over a pre-existing, 
empty or  neutral space, or a space determined solely by geography, 
climate, anth ropology, or some other comparable consideration .  There 
is thus no good reason for positing such a radical separation between 
works of  art and products as to imply the work's total transcendence 
of  the product. The benefit to be derived from this conclusion is  that it 
leaves us some prospect of d iscovering a dia lectical relationship in which 
works are in a sense inherent in products, while products do not press 
all creativity into the service of repeti t ion. 

A social space cannot be adequately accounted for either by nature 
(cl imate, site) or by its previous h istory. Nor does the growth of the 
forces of  production give rise in any di rect causal fashion to a part icu lar  
space or a particu lar t ime .  Mediations, and mediators, have to be taken 
into consideration : the action of groups, factors within knowledge, 
within ideology, or within the domain of representations. Social space 
contains a great diversity of objects, both natural and socia l ,  including 
the networks and pathways which fac i l i ta te the exchange of material 
th ings and information . Such 'objects ' are thus not only things but also 
relations. As objects, they possess discernible pecul iarities, contour and 
form. Social labour transforms them, rearranging thei r  positions with in  
spatio-temporal configurations without necessari ly affecting their 
materia l i ty, their natural state (as in  the case, for instance, of an island, 
gulf, river or mounta in ) .  

Let us turn now to another example:  Tuscany.  Another Italian ex­
ample, be it noted, and no doubt this is because in  Italy the h istory of 
precapital ism is especial ly rich in  meaning and the growth leading up 



78 SOCIAL S PACE 

to the industrial era particularly rapid, even if  this progress was to be 
offset during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by slowdown and 
rela tive retardation. 

From about the th irteenth century, the Tuscan urban oligarchy of 
merchants and burghers began transforming lordly domains or lat ifundia 
that they had inherited or acquired by establ ishing the metayage system 
(or colonat partiaire) on these lands: serfs gave way to metayers. A 
metayer was supposed to receive a share of what he produced and 
hence, unl ike a slave or a serf, he had a vested interest in production. 
The trend thus set in  tra in ,  which gave rise to a new social rea l ity, was 
based neither on the towns alone, nor on the country a lone, but rather 
on their (dia lectica l )  relationship in  space, a space which had i ts own 
basis in their h istory. The urban bourgeoisie needed at once to feed the 
town-dwell ers, invest in agriculture, and draw upon the territory as a 
whole as it supplied the markets that it controlled with cerea ls, wool, 
leather, and so on. Confronted by these requirements, the bourgeoisie 
transformed the country, and the countryside, according to a precon­
ceived plan, accord ing to a model .  The houses of the metayers, known 
as poderi, were arranged in  a circle around the mansion where the 
proprietor would come to stay from time to time, and where his stewards 
l ived on a permanent basis. Between poderi and mansion ran a l leys of  
cypresses. Symbol of property, immorta l i ty and perpetuity, the  cypress 
thus inscribed itsel f upon the countryside, imbuing it with depth and 
meaning.  These trees, the criss-crossing of these al leys, sectioned and 
organ ized the land. Their  arrangement was evocative of the laws of 
perspective, whose fu l lest rea l ization was s imultaneously appearing in 
the shape of the urban piazza in i ts architectural setting. Town and 
country - and the relationship between them - had given birth to a 
space which it would fal l  to the painters, and first among them in Italy 
to the Siena school, to identify, formulate and develop. 

In  Tuscany, as elsewhere during the same period ( including France, 
which we shall have occasion to discuss later in  connection with the 
' history of space' ) ,  i t  was not simply a matter of material production 
and the consequent appearance of socia l  forms, or even of a social 
production of material  rea l i ties. The new socia l  forms were not ' in­
scribed' in  a pre-existing space. Rather, a space was produced that was 
neither rural nor urban, but the result of  a newly engendered spatial 
relationsh ip between the two. 

The cause of, and reason for, this transformation was the growth of 
productive forces - of crafts, of early industry, and of agriculture. But 
growth could only occur via the town-country relationship, and hence 



SOC I A L  SPACE 79 

via those groups which were the motor of development: the urban 
oligarchy and a portion of the peasantry. The resu lt was an increase in 
wealth,  hence a lso an increase in surplus production, and this in turn 
had a retroactive effect on the init ia l  conditions. Luxurious spending on 
the construction of palaces and monuments gave artists, and primari ly 
painters, a chance to express, a fter thei r own fash ion, what was hap­
pening, to display what they perceived. These artists 'discovered' per­
spective and developed the theory of it because a space in  perspective 
lay before them, because such a space had a lready been produced. Work 
and product are only distinguishable here with the benefit of ana lytic 
hindsight. To separate them completely, to posit a radical fissure between 
them, would be tantamount to destroying the movement that brought 
both into being - or, rather, since it is al l  that remains to us, to destroy 
the concept of that movement .  The growth I have been describing, and 
the development that went hand in  hand with it, did not take p lace 
without many conflicts, without class struggle between the a ristocracy 
and the rising bourgeoisie, between populo minuto and populo grosso 
in the towns, between townspeople and country people, and so on. 
The sequence of events corresponds in large measure to the revolution 
communale that took pl ace in a part of France and elsewhere in Europe, 
but the l inks between the various aspects of the overal l  process a re 
better known for Tuscany than for other regions, and indeed they a re 
more marked there, and their effects more striking. 

Out o f  this process emerged, then, a new representation of space : the 
visual perspective shown in  the works of painters and given form first 
by architects and later by geometers. Knowledge emerged from a prac­
tice, and elaborated upon it by means of formalization and the appli­
cation o f  a logical order. 

This is not to say that during this period in Italy, even in  Tuscany 
around Florence and Siena, townspeople and vi l lagers did not continue 
to experience space in the traditional emotional and rel igious manner -
that is to say, by means of the representation of an  interplay between 
good and evil forces at war throughout the world, and especially in and 
around those places wh ich were of special significance for each individ­
ual :  his body, his house, his land, as a lso his church and the graveyard 
which received his dead. Indeed this representational space continued 
to figure in many works of painters and arch itects. The point is merely 
that some artists and men of learning arrived at a very d i fferent represen­
tation of space : a homogeneous, clearly demarcated space complete with 
horizon and vanishing-point. 



80 SOCIAL SPACE 

II 

Towards the middle of  the nineteenth century, in a few 'advanced' 
coun tries, a new real ity began to agitate populations and exercise minds 
because it posed a mult itude of problems to which no solutions were 
as yet apparent. This ' real i ty' - to use a conventional and rather crude 
term - did not offer itself either to analysis or to action in a clear and 
distinct way. In the practical realm, i t  was known as ' industry ' ;  for 
theoretica l thought, it was 'political economy' ;  and the two went hand 
in hand.  Industrial practice brought a set  of new concepts and questions 
into p lay ;  reflection on this practice, in conjunction with reflection 
on the past (h istory ) and with the critical evaluation of innovations 
(sociology) ,  gave birth to a science that would �oon come to predomi­
nate, namely political economy. 

How did the people of that time actual ly proceed, whether those who 
laid claim to responsibi l i ties in connection with knowledge 
(phi losophers, scholars, and especial ly 'economists') or those who did 
so in the sphere of  action (politicians, of course, but also capitalist 
entrepreneu rs) ? They proceeded, certainly, in a fash ion which to them 

I seemed solid, i rrefu table and 'positive' (cf. the emergence of positivism 
I at the same period ) .  ' 

Some people counted things, objects. Some, such as the inspired 
Charles Babbage, described machines ; others described the products of 
mach inery, with the emphasis on the needs that the things thus produced 
fu lfi l led, and on the markets open to them. With a few exceptions, these 
people became lost in deta i l ,  swamped by mere facts ; a l though the 
ground seemed firm a t  the outset - as indeed it was - their efforts 
s imply missed the mark. Th is was no impediment, however, in extreme 
cases, to the passing-off of the description of some mechanical device, 
or of  some sel l ing-technique, as knowledge in the highest sense of the 
term. (It scarcely needs pointing out how little has changed in this 
respect in the last century or more . )  

Things and products that  are measured, that  is to say reduced to the 
common measure of money, do not speak the truth about themselves. 
On the contrary, it is in their nature as th ings and products to conceal 
that truth. Not that  they do not speak at a l l :  they use their own language, 
the l anguage of things and products, to tout the satisfaction they can 
supply and the needs they can meet; they use it too to l ie, to dissimulate 
not only the amount of social labour that they contain, not only the 
productive labour that they embody, but a lso the socia l  rela tionships of 



SOCIAL SPACE 8 1  
exploitation and domination on which they are founded. Like al l  langu­
ages, the language of things is as useful for ly ing as i t  is for tel l i ng the 
truth . Things lie, and when, having become commodities, they l ie in 
order to conceal their origin,  namely social labour, they tend to set 
themselves up as absolutes. Products and the circuits they establish ( in  
space) are fetish ized and so become more ' real ' than real i ty i tsel f - that i s ,  
than productive activity itse lf, wh ich they thus take over. This tendency 
achieves its u l timate expression, of course, in the world market. Objects 
h ide something very important, and they do so all the more effectively 
inasmuch as we ( i .e .  the 'subject') cannot do without them ; inasmuch, 
too, as they do give us pleasure, be it i l l usory or real (and how can 
i l lusion and real i ty be distinguished in the rea lm of  pleasure ? ) .  But 
appearances and i l lusion are located not in the use made of things or 
in the pleasure derived from them, but rather within things themselves, • 
for things are the substrate of mendacious signs and meanings. The 
successful unmasking of things in  order to reveal  (social )  relationships 
- such was Marx's great achievement, and, whatever political tendencies 
may call themselves Marxist, it remains the most durable accomplish­
ment of Marxist thought .  A rock _ on a mountainside, a cloud, a blue 
sky, a bird on a tree - none 9f these, of course� can be said-to l ie .  
Nature presents itseif as it is, now cruel ,  now generous. It does not seek 
to deceive; it may reserve many an unpleasant surprise for us, but it 
never l ies. So-ca l led social rea l i ty is dual, multiple, p lura l .  To what 
extent, then, does it (urnish a real i ty at al l ?  I f  real ity is taken in the 
sense of  materia l ity, social rea l i ty no longer has real i ty, nor is it real ity. 
On 

-
the other hand, i t  conta ins and implies some terribly concrete 

abstractions ( including, as cannot be too often emphasized, money, 
commodities and the exchange of material  goods), as well as 'pure'  
forms :  exchange, language, signs, equivalences, reciprocities, contracts, 
and so on.  \ 

According to Marx (and no one who has considered the matter at a l l  
has managed to demol ish th is  basic ana lytical premise ) ,  merely to note 
the existence of things, whether specific objects or ' the object' in general, 
is to ignore what things at once embody and dissimulate, namely socia l  
rel ations and  the  forms of those relations. When no heed is paid to  the 
relations that inhere in social facts, knowledge misses i ts target; our 
understanding is reduced to a confirmation of the undefined and inde­
finable multipl icity of things, and gets lost in classifications, descriptions 
and segmentations. 

In order to arrive at an inversion and revolution of  meaning that 
would reveal authentic meaning, Marx had to overthrow the certainties 



82 SOC I A L  SPACE 

of an epoch ; the n ineteenth century's confident faith in  things, in rea l ity, 
had to go by the board. The 'posit ive '  and the 'real ' have never lacked 
for j ust ifications or for strong supporting arguments from the standpoin t  
of common sense and of everyday l i fe, so  Marx had his work cut  out  
when i t  fel l  to  h im to demolish such claims. Admittedly, a fa ir part of 
the job had a l ready been done by the phi losophers, who had considerably 
eroded the calm sel f-assurance of common sense. But it was stil l up 
to Marx to smash such ph i losophical abstractions as the appeal to 
transcendence, to conscience, to Mind or to Man : he still had to tran­
scend phi losophy and preserve the truth at the same time. 

To the present-day reader, Marx's work may seem peppered with 
polemics that were flogged to death long ago. Yet, despi te the superfluity, 
these discussions have not lost a l l  their significance (no thanks, be it 
said, to the far more superfluous commentaries of the orthodox 
Marx ists ) .  Already in Marx's time there were plenty of people ready to 
s ing paeans to the progress ach ieved th rough economic, social or political 
rationality. They readi ly envisaged such a rational i ty as the way forward 
to a ' better' real i ty .  To them, Marx responded by showing that what 
they took for progress was merely a growth in the productive forces, 
which, so far from solving so-ca lled 'socia l '  and 'politica l '  problems, 
was bound to exacerbate them. On the other hand, to those who 
lamented the passing of an earlier era, this same Marx pointed out the 
new poss ib i l i ties opened up by the growing forces of production .  To 
revolutionaries raring for immediate al l -out action, Marx offered con­
cepts; to fact-collectors, he offered theories whose 'operational '  import 
would only become apparent later on : theories of the organization of 
production as such, theories of planning. 

On the one hand, Marx retrieved the contents which the predominant 
tendency - the tendency of the rul ing class, though not so perceived -
sought to avoid at a l l  costs. Specifically, these contents were productive 
labour, the productive forces, and the relations and mode of production.  
At the same t ime, countering the tendency to fragment rea l ity , to break 
i t  down in to 'facts' and statistics, Marx identified the most general form 
of socia l  relations, namely the form of exchange (exchange value) . (Not 
their sole form, it must be emphasized, but rather the form in its 
general i ty. ) 

Now let us consider for a moment any given space, any ' interva l '  
provided that  i t  i s  not empty .  Such a space contains th ings yet is not 
itself a thing or material 'object ' .  Is it then a floating 'medium',  a simple 
abstraction, or a 'pure' form ? No - precisely because i t  has a content. 

We have a l ready been led to the conclusion that any space implies, 



SOCIAL SPACE 83 

contains and dissimulates social relationships - and this despite the fact 
that a space is not a th ing bur rather a set of rel ations between things 
(objects and products) .  Might we say that it is or tends co become the 
absolute Thing? The answer must be affirmative to the extent that every 
thing which achieves autonomy through the process of exchange ( i .e .  
attains the status of a commodity) tends to become absolute - a tend­
ency, in fact, that defines Marx's concept of fetishism (practical a l ien­
ation under capital ism) .  The Th ing, however, never quite becomes absol­
ute, never quite emancipates itself from activity, from use, from need, 
from 'social being'. What are the impl ications of this for space ? That is 
the key question. 

Whl'.n we CQ.!}template a field of w�_eat or maize,__ we are well aware 
that the furrows, the pattern of sowing, and the boundaries, be they 
hedges or wire fences, designate relations of production and property .  

�We also real ize thiolt this i s  much less true of uncul tivated land, heath 
or forest. The more a space partakes of nature, the less it enters i nto 
the social relations of production. There is nothing surprising about 
th is ;  the same holds true after al l  for a rock or a tree. On the other 
hand, spaces of this type, spaces with predominantly natura l  traits or 
containing objects with predominantly natural traits, a re, l ike natu re 
itsel f, on the decl ine. Take national or regional 'nature parks', for 
instance: it is not at a l l  easy to decide whether such places are natural 
or a rtificial .  The fact is that the once-prevalent characteristic 'natural ' 
has grown indistinct and become a subordinate feature. Inversely, the 
social character of space - those social relations that it implies, conta ins 
and diss imulates - has begun visibl)' to dominate. This typical qual i ty 
of visibi l ity does not, however, imply decipherabil ity of the inherent 
socia l  relations. On the contrary, the ana lysis of these relations has 
become harder and more paradoxica l .  

What can be said,  for example, of a peasant dwel l ing? I r  embodies 
and impl ies particu lar social relations ; i t  shelters a family - a particular 
family belonging to a particu lar country, a particu lar region, a particular 
soil ; and i t  is a component part of a particular site and a particular 
countryside. No matter how prosperous or humble such a dwel l ing may 
be, i t  is as much a work as i t  is a produce, even though i t  is invariably 
representative of a type. I t  remains, to a greater or lesser degree, part 
of nature. It is an object intermediate between work and product, 
between nature and labour, between the realm of symbols and the realm 
of signs. Does it engender a space ? Yes. Is that space natura l  or cultura l ?  
l s  it immediate or mediated - and, i f  the latter, mediated by  whom and 
to what purpose ? Is it a given or is it a rti ficial ?  The answer to such 



84 SOC I A L  SPACE 

questions must be: 'Both . '  The answer is ambiguous because the ques­
tions are too simple: between 'nature' and 'culture', as between work 
and product, complex relationships (mediations) a l ready obtain. The 
same goes for time and for the 'object' in space. 

To compare different maps of a region or country - say France - is 
to be struck by the remarkable diversity among them. Some, such as 
maps that show 'beauty spots' and historical sites and monuments to 
the accompaniment of  an appropriate rhetoric, aim to mysti fy in fairly 
obvious ways. Th is kind of map designates places where a ravenous 
consumption picks over the last remnants of nature and of the past in 
search of whatever nourishment may be obta ined from the signs of 
anything h istorical or original .  I f  the n:i�ps and gu ide�_.!!_re to be bel ieved, 
a veritable feast of authenticity awaits 

- the-tourist. The conventional 
signs used on these documents constitute a code even more deceptive 
than the things themselves, for they are at one more remove from rea l i ty .  
Next, consider an ordinary map of roads and other communications in 
France. What such a map reveals, i t s  meaning - not ,  perhaps, to the 
most ingenuous inspection, but certa inly to an intell igent perusal with 
even m inimal preparation - is at once clear and hard to decipher. A 
diagonal band traverses the supposedly one and indivisi ble Republ ic l ike 
a bandolier. From Berre-l 'Etang to Le Havre via the val leys of the Rhone 
(the great Delta), the Saone and the Seine, this stripe represents a narrow 
over-industria l ized and over-urbanized zone which relegates the rest of 
our dear old France to the rea lm of underdevelopment and 'touristic 
potential ' .  Until only recently this state of  a ffai rs was a sort of official 
secret, a project known only to a few technocrats. Today (summer 1 973 ) 
it is common knowledge - a banality. Perhaps not so banal ,  though , i f  
one turns from tourist maps to a map of  operational and projected 
mi l itary instal lations in  southern France. It will readily be seen that th is 
vast area, which has been earmarked, except for certain wel l -defined 
areas, for tourism, for national parks - that is, for economic and socia l  
decl ine - is a l so destined for heavy use by a mil i ta ry which finds such 
peripheral regions ideal for i ts diverse purposes. 

These spaces are produced. The ' raw materia l '  from which they a re 
prOduceCf is natl.!�- Th_ey are products of an  activity which involves the 
econom'ic and technical rea lms but which extends well_ beyond (f{effi� 
for these are also pol itical products, and strategic spaces. The tetrii 
'strategy' connotes a great variety of products and actions :  it combines 
peace with war, the a rms trade with deterrence in the event of crisis, 
and the use of resources from peripheral spaces with the use of riches 
from industri a l ,  urban, state-dominated centres.

-
f Space is never produced in  the sense that a ki logram of sugar or a 

rd of cloth is produced. Nor is it an aggregate of the places or 
cations of such products as sugar, wheat or cloth . Does it then come 

into being after the fashion of a superstructure ? Again ,  no. I t  would be 
more accurate to say that i t  is at once a precondition and a result of 
soci al superstructures. The state and each of its constituent i nstitutions 
cal l for spaces - but spaces which they can then organize according to 
their specific requirements; so there is no sense in which space can be 
treated solely as an a priori condition of these institutions and the state 
which presides over them . Is space a socia l  relationship ?  Certa inly - but 
one which is inherent to property relationships (especia l ly the ownership 
of the earth, of land) and a lso closely bound up with the forces of 
production (which impose a form on that earth or land ) ;  here we see 
the polyvalence of socia l  space, its 'rea l ity' at once formal and materia l .  
Though a PI_Q!/uct to be used, to be consumed, i t  is a lso a means of 
production;  networks of exchange and flows of raw materials a nd 
energy fashion space and a{e determined by it .  Thus this means of 
production, produced as such, cannot be separated either from the 
productive forces, including technology and knowledge, or from the 
socia l  division of labour which shapes it ,  or from the state and the 
superstru ctu res of socie:!.:_.J 

III 

As it develops, then, the concept of social  space becomes broader. It 
i;6i crates, even invades, the e<:mcept of production, becoming part -
perha..e_s the es��al part - of its co!J!�!}t. Thence it sets a very specific 
dialectiz-Tn

-
motion, which, while it does not abolish the 

production-consumption relationship as this appl ies to things (goods, 
commodities, objects of  exchange) ,  certainly does modify i t  by widening 
it. Here a unity transpires between levels wh ich analysis often keeps 
separate from one another: the forces of production and their  component 
elements (nature, l abour, technology, knowledge) ; structures (property 
relations) ; superstructures ( institutions and the state itsel f) . 

How many maps, i n  the descriptive or geographical sense, might be 
needed to deal exhaustively with a given space, to code and decode a l l  
its meanings and contents ? I t  is doubtful whether a finite number can 
ever be given in answer to this sort of question. What we are most l ikely 
confronted with here is a sort of instant infiniry, a s ituation reminiscent 
of a Mondrian painting. I t  i s  not only the codes - the map's legend, the 



86 SOCIAL SPACE 

conventional signs of map-making and map-reading - that are l iable to 
change, but also the objects represented, the lens through which they 
are viewed, and the scale used. The idea that a small number of maps 
or even a single (and singular) map might be sufficient can only apply 
in a special ized area of study whose own self-affirmation depends on 
isolation from its context. 

There are data of the greatest relevance today, furthermore, that it 
would be very d ifficult, i f  not impossible, to map at a l l .  For example, 
where, how, by whom, and to what purpose is information stored and 
p rocessed ? How is computer technology deployed and whom does it 
serve ? We know enough in this a rea to suspect the existence of a space 
pecul iar  to information science, but not enough to describe that space, 
much less to claim close acquaintanceship with it. 

We are confronted not by one socia l  space but by many - indeed, by 
an unl imit�d �ult ipl ici ty or uncountable set of social spaces wb.iChwe 
refer  to generical ly as 'so�ial space'> No space disappears in the course 
of  growth and development: the worldwide does not abolish the local. 
This is not a consequence of the law of uneven development, but a law 
in its own right .  The intertwine.ment of social spaces is also a law. 
Considered in isolation, such spaces are mere abstractions. As concrete 
abstracti�;s ,  however, they attain 'rea l '  existence by vl rtueOTnetwoi:'ks 
and path"'Wllys,· by vtnue-of ouifrhes or (Justers of relationships. Instances 
of this a re the worldwide networks of communication, exchange and 
information. It is important to note that such newly developed networks 
do not eradicate from their socia l  context those earlier ones, superim­
posed upon one another over the years, wh ich constitute the various 
markets : local, regional ,  national and i nternational markets ; the market 
in commodities, the money or capital market, the labour market, and 
the market in  works, symbols and signs ;  and lastly - the most recently 
created - the market in spaces themselves. Each market, over the centur­
ies, has been consol idated and has attained concrete form by means of  
a network : a network of buying- and sel l ing-points in the case of the 
exchange of commodities, of banks and stock exchanges in the case of 
the circulation of capita l ,  of labour exchanges in the case of the labour 
market, and so on.  The corresponding buildings, in the towns, bear 
materi al testimony to this evolution . Thus social space, and especial ly 
urban space, emerged in al l  i ts divers i ty - and with a structure far more 
reminiscent of flaky mille-feuille pastry than of the homogeneous and 
isotropic space of classical (Euclidean/Cartes ian) mathematics.

l imit ing boundaries and which col l ide because of their contours or as a 
resu lt  of inert ia .  Figurative terms such as 'sheet' and 'stratum '  have 
serious drawba'Cks: being metaphorical rather than conceptual, they 
assimi la te space to things and thus relegate i ts concept to the rea lm of 
abstraction.  Visible boundaries, such as walls or enclosures in general, 
give rise for thei r part to an appearance of separation between spaces 
where in fact what exists is  an ambiguous continuity. The space of a 
room,  bedroom, house or garden may be cut off in a sense from social 
space by barriers -and walls, by al l  the signs of private property, yet 
still remain fup.damental ly part of that space. Nor can such spaces be 
considered empty 'mediums', in the sense of containers dist inct from 
their contents. Produced over time, distinguishable yet not separable, 
they can be compared neither to those local spaces evoked by astron­
omers such as Hoyle, nor to sedimentary substrata, a lthough this last 
comparison is certainly more defensible than any to be derived from 
mathematics. A much more fruitful  ana logy, it seems to me, may be 
found in hydrodynamics, where the principle of the superimposition of 
small movements teaches us the importance of  the roles played by scale, 
dimension and rhythm .  Great movements, vast rhythms, immense waves 
- these all col l ide and ' in terfere' with one another; lesser movements, 
on the other hand, interpenetrate. I f  we were to follow this model, we 
would say that any socia l  locus could only be properly understood by 
taking two kinds ·or determinations into account :  on the one hand, that 
lociis-would be mobil ized, carried forward and sometimes smashed apart 
by'ffiajor tendencies, those tendencies which ' interfere' with one another; 
on the other hand, i t  would be penetrated by, and shot through with, 
the weaker tendencies characteristic of networks i!lld pathways. 

This does not, of course, expla in what i t  is that produces these various 
movements, rhythms and frequencies; nor how they are sustained ; nor, 
again, how precarious h ierarchical relationships are preserved between 
major and minor tendencies, between the strategic and tactica l levels, 
or between networks and locations. A further problem with the meta­
phor of the dynamics of fluids is that i t  suggests a particu lar  analysis 
and explication ; i f  taken too far, that analysis could lead us into serious 
error. Even i f  a viable parallel may be drawn with physical phenomena 
(waves, types of waves, their associated 'quanta '  - the classification of 
radiation i n  terms of wavelengths ) ,  this analogy might guide our analysis, 
but must not be al lowed to govern the theory as a whole. A paradoxical 
implication of this paradigm is that the shorter the wavelength the 
greater the relative quantum of energy attach ing to each d iscrete element. 
Is there anything in social space comparable to this law of  physical 



8 8  SOCIAL SPACE 

space ? Perhaps so, inasmuch, at any rate, as the practical and social 
'base'  may be said to preserve a concrete existence, inasmuch as the 
counter-violence which arises in response to a given major strategic 
trend invariably has a specific and local source, namely the energy of 
an 'element' at the base - the energy, as it were, of 'elementa l '  movement. 

Be that as it may, the places of social space are very different from 
those of natural space in that they are not simply juxtaposed: they may 
be intercalated, combined, superimposed - they may even sometimes 
collide. Consequently the local (or 'punctua l', in the sense of 'determined 
by a particular "point" ') does not disappear, for it is never absorbed 
by the regional, national or even worldwide level. The national and 
regional levels take in innumerable 'places' ; national space embraces the 
regions; and world space does not merely subsume national spaces, but 
even (for the time being at least) precipitates the formation of new 
national spaces through a remarkable process of fission. All these spaces, 
meanwhile, are traversed by myriad currents. The hypercomplexiry of 
social space should by now be apparent, embracing as it does individual 
entities and peculiarities, relatively fixed points, movements, and flows 
and waves - some interpenetrating, others in conflict, and so on. 

The princjple_of_J_he in.terpenet.ration _and supe1impositio_n _ _ Q.f social 
spaces has one very helpful result, for it means that each fragment of 
space subject�d tQ, analysi� masks not jui{ Of)e s().�ial relationship but a 
host of them that, analysis can potenti�ly discliJSe. It will be. recalled 
that the same "goes for objects : corresponding to needs, they result from 
a division of fabour, enter into the ciriuits of exchange,_ and so forth. 

Our initia l hyp�thesis having now been considerably expanded, a 
number of remarks are ca l led for. 

1 There is a certain similarity between the present situation, in both its 
practical and its theoretical aspects, and the one which came to prevail 
in the middle of the nineteenth century. A fresh set of questions - a 
fresh 'problematic' as the philosophers say - is in the process of usurping 
the position of the old problems, substituting itself for them and superim­
posing itself upon them without for all that abolishing them completely. 

The most 'orthodox' among the Marxists will doubtless wish to deny 
this state of affairs. They are firmly and exclusively committed to the 
study of production in the usual sense of the production of things, of 
'goods', of commodities. They are even reluctant to acknowledge that, 
inasmuch as the 'city' constitutes a means of production (inasmuch as 
it amounts to something more than the sum of the 'productive factors' 
that it embodies), there is a conflict between the social character of this 



SOC I A L  SPACE 89  

production and  the private ownersh ip o f  its location. This attitude 
triv ia l izes thought in general and critical thought in particu lar .  There 
are even some people, seemingly, who go so far as to cla im that any 
d iscussion of space, of the city, of the earth and urban sphere, tends 
only to obscure 'cl ass consciousness' and thus help demobi l ize the 
workers so far as class struggle is concerned. One should not have to 
waste t ime on such asinin ity but, sad to say, we shal l be obliged to 
come back to this complaint later on .  

2 Our chief concern is with space. The problematic of space, which 
subsumes the problems of the urban sphere {the city and i ts extensions) 
and of  everyday l i fe (programmed consumption ) ,  has displaced the 
problematic of industria l ization . I t  has not, however, destroyed that 
earlier set of problems: the social rel ationships that obtained previously 
sti l l  obta in ;  the new problem is, precisely, the problem of their repro­
duction. 

3 Jn Marx's time, economic science (or, rather, attempts to elevate 
political economy to the rank of a science) became swal lowed up in 
the enumeration and description of products (objects, things) - in the 
application to them of the methods of book-keeping. Al ready at that 
time there were special ists wait ing to divide up these tasks, and to 
perform them with the help of concepts or pseudo-concepts which were 
not yet referred to as 'operational '  but which were a lready an effective 
means for class ifying and counting and mentally pigeonholing ' things ' .  
Marx replaced th i s  study of things taken ' in  themselves ' , in isolation 
from one another, with a critical analysis of productive activity i tself 
(socia l  labour; the relations and mode of production) .  Resuming and 
renewing the i nitiatives of the founders of so-ca l led economic science 
(Smith, Ricardo) ,  he combined these with a fundamental crit ique of 
capital ism, so achieving a h igher level of knowledge .

ments space and cuts it up into _pieces. I t  enumerates the things, the 
various objects, that space conta,Ws. Specia l izations divide space among 
theman(fact upon its truncated parts, setting up mental barriers and 
practico-social frontiers. Thus a�chi tects a re assigned archi tectural space

in accordance with the social division of labour. I t  bases i ts image of 
the forces occupying space on the idea that space is a passive receptacle. 
Thus,_instedd�f uncovering __ilie social relationships ( including class 
relationships) that are latent in spaces, i nstead of corn;�n_!ratjng our 
attention on the production of space and the social relationships inherent 
to it --relationships which introduce specific contradictions into pro­
duction, so- echoing the contradiction between. the private ownership of 
the means of  production . and the social character of tlfr productive 
forces - we fal l  into the trap of t;eating space as space · ' in  itself' , as 
space as such. We come to th ink in terms ofspat ia l i ty, and so to fetishize - -
space in a way reminiscent of the old fetishism of commodi ties, where 
the trap lay in  exchange, and the error was to consider 'things ' in 
isolation, as 'things in themselves ' .  

5 There can be no doubt that  the problematic of  space results from a 
growth in the forces of production. (Talk of 'growth'  tout court is better 
avoided, since this abstraction is forever being used in an ideological 
manner. ) The forces of production and technology now permit of inter­
vention at every level of space : local ,  regional ,  national, worldwide. 
Space as a whole, geographical or historical space, is thus modified, but 
without any concomitant abolition of its underpinnings - those in it ia l  
'points' ,  those first foci or nexuses, those 'places' ( local i ties, regions, 
countries) lying at different levels of a social space in which nature's 
space has been replaced by a space-qua-product. In  this way reflex ive 
thought passes from produced space, from the space of production (the 
production of th ings in  space) to the production of space as such, which 
occurs on account of  the ( relatively) continuous growth of  the productive 
forces but which is confined within the (relatively) discontinuous frame­
works of the dominant relations and mode of production. Consequently, 
before the concept of the production of space can ful ly be grasped, it  
wi l l  be necessary to dispel ideologies which serve to conceal the use of  
the  productive forces with in modes of production in general ,  and within 
the dominant mode of production in particular. The ideologies wh ich 
have to be destroyed for our immediate purposes are those which 
promote (abstract) spatia l ity and segmented representations of space. 
Naturally, such ideologies do not present themselves for what they are ;  
instead, they pass themselves off as establ ished knowledge. The difficulty 
and complexity of our critica l task derives from the fact that it appl ies 
at once to the (menta l )  forms and practical ( socia l )  contents of space. 

6 The search for a science of space has been going on for years, and 
this from many angles of approach : phi losophy,  epistemology, ecology, 



SOCIAL SPACE 9 1  
geopolit ics ,  systems theory (deci sion-making systems; cognitive systems), 
anth ropology, ethnology, and so on.  Yet such a science, forever teetering 
on the brink of existence, has yet to come into being. Th is situation is 
truly tanta l iz ing for workers i n  these fields, but the reason for it i s  
noi: far to seek. Knowledge of spaces wavers between description and 
dissection.  Th ings in space, or p ieces of space, are  described. Part-spaces 
are carved out for inspection from social space as a whole. Thus we are 
offered a geographical space, an ethnological space, a demographic 
space, a space pecul iar to the information sciences, and so on ad 
infinitum. Elsewhere we hear of pictu ral, musical or plast ic spaces . What 
is a lways overlooked is the fact that this sort of fragmentation tal l ies 
not only with the tendency of language i tsel f, not only with the wishes 
of special ists of all kinds, but a lso with the goals of existing society, 
which, with in the overal l  framework of a strictly controlled and thus 
homogeneous total i ty, spl its itself up into the most heterogeneous spaces : 
housing, labour, leisure, sport, tourism, astronautics, and so on. The 
resu l t  is that all focus is lost as the emphasis shifts either to what exists 
in space (things considered on their own, in reference to themselves, 
their past, or their names), or else to space emptied, and thus detached 
from what i t  contains :  either objects in  space or else a space without 
objects, a neutral space. So i t  is indeed because of its predilection for 
partia l  representations that this search for knowledge is confounded, 
integrated unintentionally into existing society and forced to operate 
within that society's framework. I t  i s  continual ly abandoning any global 
perspective, accepting fragmentation and so coming up with mere shards 
of knowledge. From time to time it makes an a rbitrary 'total ization' on 
the basis of some issue or other, thus creating yet another 'area of 
special ization' .  What is urgently required here is a c lear distinction 
between an imagined or sought-after 'science of space' on the one hand 
and real knowledge of the production of space on the other. Such a 
knowledge, in contrast to the dissection, interpretations and represen­
tations of a would-be science of space, may be expected to rediscover 
time (and in the fi rst place the time of production ) in and through space. 

7 The rea l  knowledge that we hope to attain would have a retrospective 
as well as a prospective import. Its implications for h istory, for example, 
and for our understanding of time, wil l  become apparent i f  our hypoth­
esis turns out to be correct. I t  will help us to grasp how societies generate 
their (socia l )  space and time - their representational spaces and their 
representations of space. I t  should a lso al low us, not to foresee the 
future, but to bring relevant factors to bear on the future in prospect -



92 SOCIA L  SPACE 

on the project, in other words, of another space and another time in 
another (possible or impossible) society. 

IV 

To suggest out of the blue that there is a need for a 'critique of space' 
is l iable to seem paradoxical or even intel lectual ly outrageous. In the 
first place, i t  may well be asked what such an expression might mean;  
one normal ly criticizes a person or a th ing - and space is neither. In 
phi losophical terms, space is neither subject nor object. How can it  be 
effectively grasped ? It is inaccessible to the so-ca lled critical spir i t  (a 
spirit which apparently reached its apogee in the watered-down Marxism 
of  'critical theory ' ) .  Perhaps this difficulty explains why there is no 
a rch itectural or urbanistic cri ticism on a par with the criticism of art, 
l i terature, music and theatre. There would certainly seem to be a need 
for such criticism : its 'object' is at least as important and interesting as 
the aesthetic objects of everyday consumption. We are talking, after a l l ,  
of the setting in which we l ive .  Criticism of l i teratu re, ar t  or drama is 
concerned with people and institutions: with painters, dealers, gal leries, 
shows, museums, or else with publishers, au thors and the culture market. 
Architectural and urbanistic space seems, by contrast, out of range. On 
the mental level, i t  is evoked in daunting terms : readabil i ty, vis ibi l i ty, 
intel l igibi l i ty .  Socia l ly ,  it appears as the intangible outcome of h istory, 
society and culture ,  all of which are supposedly combined with in it. 
Should we conclude tha t the absence of a criticism of space is simply 
the result of a lack of an appropriate terminology ? Perhaps - but, i f  so, 
the reasons for this l ack themselves need explaining. 

At a l l  events, a criricism of space is certainly called for inasmuch as 
spaces cannot be adequately explained on the basis either of the myth ical 
image .. of pure transparency or of its opposite, the myth of the opacity 
of nature; inasmuch, too, as spaces conceal their contents by means of 
meanings, by means of an absence of meaning or by means of an 
overload of meaning; and inasmuch, last ly ,  as spaces sometimes l ie just 
as th in�_s l ie, ev�n though they _e_re not _themselves !h ings. 

-

Eventually, moreover, it would also fa l l  to a critique of this kind to 
rip aside appearances which have noth ing particu larly mendacious about 
them. Consider a house, and a street, for example. The house has six 
storeys and an air of stabi l i ty about it. One might a lmost see it as the 
epitome of immovabil ity, with its concrete and its stark, cold and rigid 



S O C I A L  SPACE 93 

outlines. (Bui l t  around 1 950 :  no metal or plate glass yet. ) Now, a critical 
analysis would doubtless destroy the appearance of sol idity of this house, 
stripping it ,  as it were, of its concrete slabs and its thin non-load-bearing 1 
walls, which are rea l ly glorified screens, and uncovering a very di fferent · 
picture. In the l ight of this imaginary ana lysis, our house would emerge 
as permeated from every direction by streams of energy which run in 
and out of it by every imaginable route:  water, gas, electricity, te lephone 
l ines, radio and television signals, and so on.  Its image of immobi l i ty 
would then be replaced by an image of a complex of mobi l i ties, a nexus 
of in and out conduits .  By depicting this convergence of waves and 
currents, this new image, much more accurately than any drawing or 
photograph, would at  the same time disclose the fact that this piece of 
' immovable property' i s  actual ly a two-faceted machine analogous to 
an active body:  at once a machine cal l ing for massive energy supplies, 
and an  information-based mach ine with low energy requirements. The 
occupants of  the house perceive, receive and manipulate the energies 
which the house i tse lf  consumes on a massive scale (for the l i ft, kitchen, 
bathroom, etc. ) .  

Comparable observations, o f  cou rse, might b e  made apropos of the 
whole street, a network of ducts constituting a structure, having a global 
form, fu lfi l l ing functions, and so on. Or aprqpos of the city, which 
consumes ( in  both senses of the word) truly colossal quantities-of energy,  
both physical and human, and which i s  in effect a constantly burning, 
blazing bonfire. Thus as  exact a picture as pOS$ible of th.is space would 
differ con�iderably from the-one embodied in lhe representational space 
which i ts j_rihabi tants have i�  the ir  minds, and which for all its inaccuracy 
plays an in tegral role in social practice. 

-

The er.Wr - or i l lusion - generated here con.sists in the fact that, when 
social space is  placed beyon_d our range of v ision in  this way, its practical 
character vanishes and i t  i� transformed in  philosoph ica l fash ion into a 
ki�d of:ibsolure. In face of this fet ishized- abstraction, 'users' spon­
ta;eously turn themselves, their presence, their ' l ived experience' and 
their bodies into abstractions too.  Fetishizesi abstract space thus gives 
r.ise tQ.. tw.o... practical abstractions :  'users' who cannot recogn ize them­
selves within it ,  and a thought which cannot conceive of adopting a 
critical stance towards it .  If this state of affa i rs were to be successfu l ly  
reversed, i t  would become clear that  the critical analysis of space as 
�!_rectly experienced poses more serious problems than any partial 
ag_ivity, no matter h"Qw important, including l i terature, reading and 
w,!ll.\ug, art, music, and the rest . Vi��-a-vis l iy_�cj ex�rience, space is 
neither a mere ' frame', a fter the fash ion of the frame of a painting, nor 



94 SOCIAL SPACE 

a forf11_qf contain_er au_ virtually neutral kind, designed simply to 
receive whatever is poured into it. Space is social morphology: it is to 
lived experience what form itself is to the living organism, and jITTtaS 
intimately bound up with function and structure. To picture space as a 
'frame' or container info which nothing can be put unless it is smaller 
than the recipient, and to imagine that this container has no other 
purpose than to preserve what has been put in it - this is probably the 
initial error. But is it error, or is it ideology ? The latter, more than 
lik�ly. If so, who promotes it ? Who exploits it ? And why and hov.{ do. 
they do so ? 

T_he theoretical error is to be content to see a space without conceiving 
of it, without concentrating discrete perceptions by means of a mental 
act, without assembling detai ls into a whole 'reality', without apprehend­
ing contents in terms of their interrelationships within the containing 
forms. The rectification of this error would very likely lead to the 
dissolution of not a few major ideological illusions. This has been the 
thrust or.the preceding remarks, in which I have sought to show that a 
space that is apparently 'neutral ', 'objective', fixed, transparent, innocent 
or indifferent implies more than the convenient establishment of an 
inoperative system of knowledge, more than an error that can be avoided 
by evoking the 'environment', ecology, nature and anti-nature, culture, 
and so forth. Rather, � .. <:!. whole set of errors, a complex of illusions, 
which can even cause us to forget completely that there is a total subject 
which acts continu_ajJy to majntain and reproduce its..o_wn conditions of 
existence, namely th� state (::Jl9ng with its foundation. in specific social 
classes and fractions of classes). We also_ forget th.at th.ere is a total 
ubject, namely absolute political space - that strategic space which seeks 
to impose itself as reality despite the fact that it is an abstraction, albeit 
one endowed with enormous powers�-becau� it is the locus and medium_ 
of Power. Whence the abstraction of the 'user' and of that so-called 
critical thinking which loses all its critical capacities when confronted 
by the great Fetishes. 

There are many lines of approach to this truth. The important thing, 
however, is to take one or other of them instead of making excuses or 
simply taking flight (even if it is forward flight). In the ordinary way, 
the study of ' real' (i.e. social) space is referred to specialists and their 
respective specialities - to geographers, town-planners, sociologists, et 
a/ii. As for knowledge of 'true' (i .e. mental) space, it is supposed to fall 
within the province of the mathematicians and philosophers. Here we 
have a double or even multiple error. T�in with, the �lit be_twe_�m ' r�;md. �true'. serv.es only.m ;ivoid any. �_@Jrontation bem:_cen pr3ctise

and theory, b�w��D Jittd ex�rice and coru:�pts, so tha.Lllmh_ sides 
oftrlese dua l i ties are distorted from the outset. Another trap i s  the resort 
to spec1almes whlcl1-antedate 'mod��;ity\�hich are themselves older 
than capita l i sm's  absorption of the enti rety of space for its own purposes, 
older than the actual possibi l i ty, thanks to science and technology, of 
producing space. Surely it is the supreme i l lusion to defer to architects, 
urban ists or p lanners as being experts or ul t imate authorities in matters 
relat ing to space. What the ' interested parties' here fa i l  to apprecia te is 
that they are bending their demands ( from below) to suit  commands 
( from above) ,  and that this  unforced renunciation on their part actual ly 
runs ahead of the wishes of the manipulators of consciousness. The real 
task, by contrast, is  to uncover and stimulate demands even at the risk 
of their wavering in face of the i mposition of oppressive and repressive 
commands.  le  is, one suspects, the ideological error par excellence to go 
instead in  search of specia l ists of  ' l ived experience' and of the mor­
phology of everyday l ife .  

Let everyone look at the space around them. What do they see ? Do 
,iliey see time ? They l ive time, a fter a l l ;  they are in time. Yet aJ.1 any<2.!le 
sees is movements. In nature, rime is apprehended with in space - in the 
very heart of  space : the hou� of the day, the season, the elevation- of 
the sun a bove the horizon, (he position of the moon and stars in  the 
heave11s, the cold and the heat, the age of  each natural being, and so 
on. Unti l  nature became localized in underdevelopment, each place 
showed its age and, l ike a tree trunk, bore the mark of the years i t  had 
taken it to grow. Time was thus inscribed in  space, and natural space 
was merely the lyrical and tragic script of natural time. (Let us not 
follow the bad example of those phi losophers who speak in this connec­
tion merely of the degradation of duration or of the outcome of 
'evolution ' . )  Wit.b the adY..ent oLmod_erlli.ty time has vanishe.dj(om soci�I 
�- It is recorded solely on measuring-instruments, on clocks, that 
are as isolated and functional ly specia l ized as this time i tsel f. Lived time 
loses its form and its social_ interest - with the exception, that  is, oJ�line 
spent working. Economicspace subordinates time to i tself; polit ical 
space expels it as threatening and dangerous ( to power) . The pri�a�y 
of the economic and above a l l  of the polit ical impl ies the supremacy of 
space over time. It is thus possible that the error concerning space that 
we have been discussing actual ly concerns time more d irectly, more 
intimately, than it does space, time being even closer to us, and more 
fundamenta l .  Our  time, then, this rnos_t_{'.ssential p�rt of lived experience, 
tbis greate_st go9d of all .guods, is  no- longer visible to us, no longer i�ible. It cannot be _£.QJJS.trqcted. It .  is .cons_umed, exhausted, and

that is _i!lh.l.LleaY.es_ no traces. I t  is conct!al�pace, hidden under a 
pi le of debris to be disposed of as soon as possible;  after a l l ,  rubbish is 
a po l lutant. 

This manifest expuls ion of time is arguably one of the ha l lmarks of 
moderni ty. It must surely have more far-reach ing impl ications than the 
simple effacement of marks or the erasing of words from a sheet of 
paper .  S ince t ime can apparently be assessed in terms of money, however, 
since it can be bought and sold j ust l ike any object ( ' time is money ' ) ,  
l i tt le wonder that  i t  disappears a fter the fashion of an object. At  which 
point it is no longer even a dimension of space, but merely an incompre­
hensible scribble or scrawl that a moment's work can completely rub 
out. It is reasonable to ask if this expuls ion or erasure of time is 
directed at historical time. The answer is :  certa inly, but only for symbolic 
purposes. It is ,  rather, the time needed for l iv ing, time as an irreducible 
good, which eludes the logic of visual ization and spatial ization (if indeed 
one may speak of  logic in this context) . Time may have been promoted 
to the level of ontology by the phi losophers, but it has been murdered 
by society. 

How could so disturbing, so outrageous an operation have been 
carried out without causing an outcry ? How can it have been passed 
off as 'normal ' ?  The fact i s  that i t  has been made part and parcel of 
socia l  norms, of  normative activity . One wonders j ust how many errors, 
or worse, how many l ies, have their roots in  the modernist trio, triad 
or trinity of readabi l ity-visib i l i ty-intel l igib i l ity. 

We may seem by now to have left the practico-social rea lm far behind 
and to be back once more amidst some very old distinctions :  appearance 
versus rea l ity, truth versus l ies, i l l usion versus revela tion . Back, in short, 
in phi losophy. And that is true, certainly,  inasmuch as our analysis is 
an extension of the phi losophical p roject; this, I hope, has already been 
made abundantly clear. On the other hand, the 'object' of criticism has 
shifted : we are concerned with practica.L_and social activi ties which .are 
supposed to _em60gy aQ"d ' show' _ili� tru_Lh.,_ l;mt which actual ly comminute 
space and 'show' nothing besides the deceptive fragments thus produced. 
The claim is that  spa

.ce can be shown-by means of space itself. Such a 
procedure (a lso known as tautology) uses and abuses a

.fami l iar  tech­
nique that is indeed as  easy to abuse as i t  i s  to use - namely, a shift 
from the part to the whole : metonymy. Take images, for example:  
photographs, advertisements, films. Can images of this kind real ly be 
expected to expose errors concerning space ? Hardly. Where there is 
error or i l lusion, the image i s  more l ikely to secrete it and reinforce it 
than to reveal it .  No matter how 'beautifu l '  they may be, such images 



SOCI A L  S P A C E  97 

belong ro an incriminated 'medium' Where the error consists in  a 
segmentation of space, moreover - and where the i l l usion consists i n  
the  fa i lure to  perceive this dismemberment - there i s  simply no possibi l i ty 
of any image rect ifying the mistake. On the contrary, im�es fra_gment; 
they are themsel��s fragments of space. Cutting things up and rearrang­
ing them, decoupage and montage - these are the alpha and omega of 
the art of image-making. As for error and i l lusion, they reside a l ready 
in  the artist's eye and gaze, in the photographer's lens, in the draftsman's 
pencil and on his blank sheet of paper. Error insinuates i tself into the 
very objects that the artist discerns, as into the sets of objects that he 
selects. Wherever there is i l l usion, the optical and visua l  world plays an

Our space has strange effects . For one thing, it unleashes desire<:lt 
pres�desir� with a 'transp�rency' which e�cour;ges it to surge forth 
in an attempt to lay claim to an apparently clear field. Of course this 
foray comes to naught, for desi re encounters no object, nothing desir­
able, and no work results from its action . Searching in vain for plenitude, 
desire must make do with words, with the rheroric of desire. Disi l l usion 
leaves space empty - an emptiness that words convey. Spaces are devas­
tated - and devastating; incomprehensibly so (without prolonged reflec­
tion at least) .  'Nothing is a l lowed. Nothing is  forbidden ' ,  in the words 
of one inhabitant. Spaces are strange : homogeneous, rational ized, and 
as such constra ining; yet at the same time utterly dislocated. Formal 
boundaries are gone between rown and country, between centre and 
periphery, between suburbs and city centres, between the domain of 
automobiles and the domain of people. Berween happiness and unhappi­
ness, for that matter. And yet everything ( 'publ ic facil it ies', blocks of  
flats, 'envi ronments for l iving') is separa ted, assigned in isolated fashion

to unconnected 'sites ' and 'tracts ' ;  the spaces themselves are specia l ized 
just  as operations are in the socia l  and technical division of labour. 

It may be said olthis .space that it- presupposes and i mplies a logic of  
visualization. Whenever a ' logic' governs an operiJ.tiona l  seq1,1eng, a 
strategy, whether conscious or unconscious, is necessari ly involved. So, 
i f  there is a ' logic of  visual ization . here, we need to understand how it 
is formed and how applied. The arroganr vertica lity of skyscrapers, and 
espeaally of publ ic and state bui ldings, introduces a phall ic or more 
precls�ly  a phal locratic element into the visual rea lm;  the purpose of 
this display, of  this need to impress, is to convey an impression of 
authori ty to each spectator. Vertical i ty and great height h_ave ever be!,!n 
the spatial expression of potential ly violent power. Th is very particu lar 
type of  spatial ization, though it may seem 'normal '  or even 'natural '  to 
many people, embodies a twofold ' logic' ,  which is to say a twofold 
strategy, in respect of  the spectator. On the one hand, _ _ �t embodies a 
metonymic logic con�isting in a continual to-and-fro moveme;[::::­
enforced �ith carrot and stick - between the part and the whole. In an 
apartment bui lding com.prising stack a fter stack of  'box�s -for ! iv�, 
for example, the spectators-cum-tenants grasp the relationship between 
part and whole directly ;  furthermore, they recognize themselves in that 
relationsh ip.  By constantly expanding the scale of things, this movement 
serves to compensate for _the pathetica l ly small size of each set of 
l iv ing-quarters ; it posits, presupposes and imposes homogeneity in  the 
subdivision of space ;  and, ultimately, i t  takes on the aspect of pure logic 
- and hence of tautology : space contains space, the v isible contains the 
vis ible - and boxes fit  into boxes. 

The second ' logic' embodied in this spatial ization is  a,_Jogic (and 
stg�egy) of metaphor - or, rather,-of co!fstant  metaphorization. Living 
bodies, the bodies of  'users' - are caught up not only in the toi ls  of 
parcel l ized space, but a lso in the web of what phi losophers call 'analo­
gons' :  images , s igns and symbols .  Th�e bo�lies are transported out of 
themselves, transferred _ �11d empJied o_u.t, as i t  were, via- the ey_!!s :  every 
kind of appeal, incitemrot and seduction is mobil ized-ta· tempt them 
with doubles of  them�dves in pretti6.�d,  smiling and h@PY poses; and 
th is campaign to void. them .succeeds exactly to the . degr�!! that the 
images proposed correspond to 'needs' that those same __ i!:llage.s .have 
-helped fas�l_Qil. So it is that a massiveinllux of information, of messages, 
runs head on into an inverse flow constituted by the evacuation from 
the innermost body of al l  l i fe and des ire. Even cars may fulfi l  the 
function of analogons, for they are at once extensions of the body and 
mobile homes, so to speak, fu l ly equipped to receive these wandering 



SOCIAL S P A C E  99 

bodies .  Were it not for the eyes and the dominant form of space, 
words and d ispersed fragments of discourse would be quite incapable of 
ensuring this 'transfer' of bodies . 

Metaphor and metonymy, then . These fami l iar concepts are borrowed, 
of  course, from l inguistics. Inasmuch, however, as we are concerned not 
with words but rather with space and spatial practice, such conceptual 
borrowing has to be underwritten by a carefu l examination of the 
relationship between space and language. 

Any determinate_ and he!lce demarcated space necessari ly embraces 
some thwgs and excludes others; what it rejects may be relegated to 
i{"ostalgi.i" or it may be simply forbidden. Such a space asserts, negates 
and depies. It has some characteristics of a 'subject', and some of an 
'object ' .  Consider the great power of a fai;ade, for example. A fai;ade 
admits certa in acts to the rea lm of what is visible, whether they occur 
on the fai;ade itsel f (on balconies, window ledges, etc . )  or are to be seen 
from the fa"ade (processions in the street, for example ) .  Many other 
acts, by contrast, i t  condemns to obscenity :  these occur behind the 
fac;ade. All of which a l ready seems to suggest a 'psychoanalysis of space' .  

In  connection with the c i ty and i ts extensions (outski rts, suburbs) , 
one occasional ly hears talk of a 'pathology of space' , of 'a i l ing neigh­
bourhoods', and so on. Th is kind of l'hraseology makes it easy for 
people who use it - archi tects, urbanists or planners - to suggest the 
idea that they are, in  effect, 'doctors of space ' .  This is to promote the 
spread of some particularly mystifying notions, and especial ly the idea 
that the modern city is a product not of the capitalist or neocapital ist 
system but rather of some putative 'sickness' of society. Such formu­
lations serve to divert attention from the criticism of space and to replace 
critical analysis by schemata that are at once not very rational and very 
reactionary. Taken to their logical l im its, these theses can deem society 
as a whole and 'man'  as a social being to be sicknesses of nature. Not 
that such a position is  utterly i ndefensible from a strictly phi losophical 
viewpoint :  one is at l iberty to hold that 'man '  is a monster, a mistake, 
a failed species on a failed planet. My point is merely that this phi losophi­
cal view, l ike many others, leads necessarily to nihi l ism. 

v 

Perhaps i t  would make sense to decide without further ado to seek 
inspiration in Marx's Capital - not in the sense of s ifting it for quotations 
nor in  the sense of subjecting it to the 'ult imate exegesis ' ,  but in the 



100 S O C I A L  S PACE 

sense of following Capital's plan in dealing with space .  There are several 
good arguments in favour of doing so, including the parallels I mentioned 
earlier between the set of problems with which we are concerned and 
the set which existed in  Marx's t ime.  In view of the fact that there a re 
plenty of 'Marxists' who th ink that discussing problems related to space 
(problems of cities or of the management of the land) merely serves to 
obfuscate the real pol i tical problems, such an association between the 
study of space and Marx's work migh t  also help dispel some gross 
misunderstandings. 

The plan of Capital, as it has emerged from the many commenta ries 
on and rereadings of  the book (the most l iteral -minded of which seem, 
incidental ly, to be the best) ,  itsel f constitutes a strong argument in favour 
of proceeding in this way. In his work preparatory to Capital, Marx 
was able to develop such essential concepts as that of (socia l )  labour. 
Labour has existed in a l l  societies, as have representations of it (pain, 
punishment, etc . ) ,  but only in the eighteenth century did the concept 
itsel f emerge. Marx shows how and why this was so, and then, having 
dealt with these prel iminaries, he proceeds to the essential ,  which is 
neither a substance nor a 'rea l i ty', but rather a form. In i tia l ly,  and 
eentra l ly, Marx uncovers an (a lmost) pure form, that of the circulation 
of material goods, or  exchange. This is a quasi- logical form simi lar ro, 
and indeed bound up with, other 'pure' forms ( identity and difference, 
equiva lence, consistency, reciprocity, recurrence, and repetition ) .  The 
circulation and exchange of material goods are distinct but not separate 
from the circulation and exchange of signs ( language, discourse ) .  � 
'pure' form here has .. a bipolar structure (use value versus exchange 
value) ,  and it has fl.lnctions wh ich Capital sets forth . fli.. a_sofifrete 
abstra.c.tion, i.Lis dex_eloped by thought - just as it developed in time 
and space - unti l  i t  reaches the level of social practice : via moner._�nd 
via labour aq,d its determinants ( i .e .  its d ialectic : i.nflividual versus social ,  
divided versus global, particulir versus mean, qual itative _JJ§ll_US 
,quantitative ) .  This kind of development is more fruitful conceptual ly 
than classical deduction, and suppler than induction or construction . In  
th i s  case, of course, i t  culminates in the notion of surplus value. The 
pivot, however, remains unchanged : by vi rtue of a dia lectical paradox, 
that pivot is a quasi-void, a near-absence - namely the form of exchange, 
which governs socia l  practice. 

Now, as for the form of social space, we are acquainted with it; it 
has a lready been identified. Another concrete abstraction, i t  has emerged 
in several stages ( in  certain  philosoph ies and major scien tific theories) 
from representations of space and from representational spaces. This 



SOCI A L  SPACE 1 0 1  

has occurred qu ite recently .  Like that o f  exchange, the form o f  social  
space l1as anaffinity with logical forms :  i t  ca l ls  for a content and caririot 
be.....(:onceivecCof as having_riS> content; but, thanki to abstraction, it i s  
in fact conceived of, precisely, as ill"dependent of  .any specific content. 
Simi larly ,  the form of materia l  exchange does not determine what is 
excnariged : i t  merely st ipulates that something, which has a use, is  
a lso an object of exchange. So too with the form of non-materia l  
communication, wh ich does not  d�termine what  sign is to  be  communi­
cated, but simply that there_.!_Tlust be a stock of distinct signs, a message, 
a channel and a code. Nor, final ly ,  does a logical form decide what is 
consistent, or what is thought, a lthough i t  does prescribe the necessity, 
i f  thought is to exist, for formal consistency . 

The form of social space is encounter, assembly, s imu ltaneity .  But 
what asse!Tlbl_es, or what is assembled ? The answer is :  everything that 
tllere is  in space, everyth ing that  is produced either by nature or by 
society, either th rough their co-operation or th rough their conflicts. 
Everyth ing: living beings, things, objects, workS, signs and symbols. 
Natura l  space j uxtaposes -- and thus disperses:  it puts places and that 
which occupies them side __ by side. I t  particu lariz�s. By contr!lst, s�_cial  
space impl ies actual  or potential assembly at a si�gle point ,  or around 
that poil)t. It implies, therefore, the possib i l i ty of accumulation (a possi­
bi l i ty that is _real ized under specific conditions) . Evidence in support of 
this proposition is suppl ied by the space of the vl![.?ge,_by tht_� of 
the  dwel l i_ng; i t  i s  overwhelmingly confirmed by  urban space, wlilch 
cleai-ly reveals many basic aspects of  social space that are sti l l  hard to 
discern in v i l lages. Urban space gathers crowds, products in the markets, 
acts and symbols. I t  concentrates all these, and accumulates them. To 
say 'urban space' is to say centre and central ity, and i t  does not matter 
whether these are actual or merely possible, saturated, broken up or 
under fire, for we are speaking here of a dia lectical centra l i ty .  

It wou ld thus be qu ite possible to elaborate on th is  form, to i l luminate 
its structures (centre/periphery ) ,  its socia l  functions, i ts relationship  to 
labour (the various markets) and hence to production and reproduction, 
its connections with precapital ist and capital ist production relations, the 
roles of  h istoric cities and of the modern urban fabric, and so on. One 
might a lso go into the dia lectical processes bound up with this relation­
ship between a form and i ts contents :  the explosions, the saturation 
points, the cha l lenges arising from internal contradictions, the assaults 
mounted by contents being pushed out towards the periphery, and so 
forth . In and of i tself, socia l  space does not have a l l  of the characteristics 
of 'things' as opposed to creative act iv ity .  Social space per se is at once 



1 02 S O C I A L  SPACE 

work and product - a 111ateria l ization_ of ' social being'. ln specific sets 
of circumstances, however, it may take on fetish ized and autonomous 
characteristics of things (of commodities and money) .  

There is thus no lack of arguments for undertaking the ambitious 
project we have been discussing. A number of objections may a lso be 
reasonably raised, however - quite aside from those based on the very 
immensity of the task . 

In the first place, the plan of Capital is not the only one Marx ever 
formulated. Its aims concern expos ition rather than content ;  i t envisages 
a strict forma l  structure, but one which impoverishes because of its 
reductionism. In the Grundrisse we find a di fferent project, another 
plan and a more fruitfu l one. Whereas Capital stresses a homogenizing 
rational i ty founded on the quasi -'pure' form, that of (exchange) value, 
the Grundrisse ins ists at  all levels on difference. Not that the Grundrisse 
leaves form out of the picture; rather, it goes from one content to the 
next and generates forms on the basis of these contents. Less rigour, 
less emphasis on logical consistency, and hence a less elaborate formaliz­
ation or axiomatization - al l leave the door open to more concrete 
themes, especia l ly in connection with the (d ialectical ) relations between 
town and country, between natural rea l i ty and social rea l i ty .  In the 
Grundrisse Marx takes all the h istorical mediations into consideration, 
including the v i l l age community, the family, and so on.5 The 'world of 
the commodity' is less far removed from its h istorical context and 
practical conditions, matters which are only taken up in the concluding 
(and unfin ished) portion of Capital. 

Secondly, there have after al l  been some changes and new develop­
ments in the l ast hundred years. Even i f  we want to keep Marx's 
concepts and categories ( including the concept of production) i n  their 
central theoretical position, i t is sti l l  necessary to incorporate a number 
of categories tha t Marx considered only at the end of h is l i fe. A case in 
point is the reproduction of the relations of production, which superim­
poses itse l f  upon the reproduction of the means of production, and 
upon the (quan t itatively) expanded reproduction of products, but which 
remains distinct from these. When reproduction i s  treated as a concept, 
however, it brings other concepts in i ts wake: repetition, reproducibi l i ty, 
and so on. Such ideas had no more place in Marx's work than did the 
terms 'urban' , 'everyday l i fe ' or 'space' .

of nature ) ,  and if therefore this tendency, when pushed to its l imit - or, 
better, when it has overcome its l imits - must eventual ly give rise to a 
new mode of production which is neither state capitalism nor state 
socia l ism, but the col lective management of space, the socia l  manage­
ment of nature, and the transcendence of the contradiction between 
natu re and anti-nature, then clea rly we cannot rely solely on the appli­
cation of the 'classica l ' categories of Marxist though�. 

Th irdly (though what I am about to say actual ly takes in and extends 
the first two points ) ,  another new development since Marx's time is the 
emergence of a plethora of discipl ines known as 'socia l '  or 'human' 
sciences. Their vicissitudes - for each has had its own particular ups 
and downs - have occasioned not a li ttle anxious inquiry concerning 
disparities of development, crises, sudden expansions fol lowed by equ­
ally sudden decl ines, and so on. The special ists and specia lized insti­
tutions natural ly seek to deny, combat or si lence whatever is liable to 
damage their reputation, but their efforts in this di rection have been 
largely in vain. Resounding fa i lures and catastrophic col lapses have been 
frequent. The early economists, for example, deluded themselves into 
thinking that they could safely ignore the Marxist inj unctions to give 
critical thought priority over model-bui lding, and to treat political 
economy as the science of poverty . Their consequent humi l iation was 
an eminently public event, al l their attempts to prevent this notwith­
standing. As for linguistics, the i l l usions and the fai lure here could 
scarcely be more obvious, especia l ly in view of the fact that , fol lowing 
the earlier examples of history and poli tical economy, this special ization 
set itse lf up as the epitome of science - as the 'science of sciences', so 
to speak. In actual iry l inguistics can legitimately concern itse l f only with 
the deciphering of texts and messages, with coding and decoding. After 
all, 'man' does not l ive by words a lone. In recent decades, l inguistics 
has become a metalanguage, and an analysis of metalanguages; an 
analysis, consequently, of social repetitiveness, one which a llows us -
no more and no less - to apprehend the enormous redundancy of past 
writings and discourse. 

Despite the uneven character and v icissitudes of their development, 
the existence of these sciences cannot be denied. In Marx's time, by 
contrast, they did not exist, or existed only in virtual or embryonic 
form ; their degree of special ization was negligible and their future 
expansionist ambitions were as yet inconceivable. 

These areas of specia l ized knowledge, at once isolated and imperial­
istic - the two are surely connected - have specific relationships with 
mental and socia l space. Some groups of scholars have simply sl iced off 



1 04 S O C I A L  SPACE 

thei r share, so to speak - staking out and enclosing their particular 'field' 
Others, fol lowing the example of  the mathematicians, have constructed a 
mental space so designed as to faci l itate the in terpretation , according to 
their particu lar  principles, of theoretical and practical (socia l )  history ; 
i n  this way they have arrived at specific representations of space. Archi­
tecture offers plenty of instances of procedures of this kind, which are 
essentia l ly  ci rcular  in form. Arch i tects have a trade. They raise the 
question of archi tectu re's 'specificity '  because they want to establ ish that 
trade's cla im to legitimacy. Some of them then draw the conclusion 
that there are such th ings as 'arch i tectural space' and 'arch itectural 
production' (specific, of  course) .  Whereupon they close their case. This 
relationship between cutting-up and representation, as it  refers to space, 
has a lready found its p lace in  the order (and the disorder) of the 
connections we have been examining. 

Sections and interpretations of this kind can be understood and taken 
up not as a function of some 'science of space' ,  or of  some total iz ing 
concept of 'spatial ity', but rather from the standpoint of productive 
activ ity. Special ists have a l ready inventoried the objects in space, some 
of them catalogu ing those that come from nature, others those that  a re 
produced. When knowledge of space (as a product, and not as an 
aggregate of  objects produced) is substituted for knowledge of things in 
space, such enumerations and descriptions take on anot�r meanirrg . .!t 
is possible to conceive .of  a 'political economy of space' which would 
go back to the old polit ical economy and rescue i t  from bankrl\l2tcy, .as 
it were, by offering i t  a new object: the production of space. I f  the 
critique of political economy (wh ich was for Marx identical with knowl­
edge of the economic realm)  were then to be resumed, it  would no 
doubt demonstrate how that polit ical economy of space corresponded 
exactly to the self-presentation of space as the worldwide medium of 
the definitive instal lation of capita l ism. A simi lar approach might well 
be adopted towards h istory, psychology, anth ropology, and so on -
perhaps even towards psychoanalysis .  

This orientation cal ls for thorough ly cla rified distinctions to be drawn 
between thought and discourse in space ( i .e .  in one particu lar  space, 
dated and located) ,  thought and discourse about space (i .e. restricted to 
words and signs, images and symbols) , and thought adequate to the 
understanding of space ( i .e. grounded in developed concepts ) .  These 
dist inctions a re themselves founded on a more fundamental one : they 
presuppose careful critical attention, on the one hand, to the materials 
used (words, images, symbols, concepts) , and, on the other hand, 
to the materiel used (col lection procedures, tools for cutting-up and 



SOCIAL SPACE 105 

reassembl ing, etc . )  - al l this within the framework of the scientific 
divis ion of labour. 

The dist inction between materia ls and materiel, though originally 
developed in other conceptual contexts, is in fact wel l  worth borrowing 
for our purposes. Materials are indispensable and durable : stone, brick, 
cement and concrete, for example - or, in the musical sphere, scales, 
modes and tones. Materiel, by contrast, is quickly used up; it must be 
replaced often ; i t is comprised of tools and directions for their use; and 
its adaptative capabil i ty is l imited : when new needs arise, new materiel 
must be invented to meet them. Instances of materiel in music would 
be the piano, the saxophone or the lute . In the construction industry, 
new techniques and equipment fa l l  under this rubric. This distinction 
may achieve a certain 'operationa l '  force inasmuch as it can be used to 
discriminate between what is ephemeral and what is more permanent :  
to decide what, i n  a particu lar scientific discipline, i s  worth preserving 
or reassigning to new tasks, and what deserves only to be rejected or 
relegated to a subsidiary role. For obsolete materiel can have only 
marginal appl ications ; it often ends up, for example, in the rea lm of 
pedagogy . 

Our re-evaluation of subdivisions and representations, along with 
their materials and materiel, need not be confined to the special ized 
disciplines we have been discussing. On the contrary, it should extend 
to phi losophy, which after all does propose representations of space and 
time. Nor should a crit ique of phi losoph ical ideologies be assumed to 
release us from the need to examine pol itical ideologies in so far as they 
relate to space. And in point of fact such ideologies relate to space in a 
most significant way, because they intervene in space in the form of 
strategies. Their effectiveness in this role - and especial ly a new develop­
ment, the fact that worldwide strategies are now seeking to generate a 
global space, their own space, and to set it up as an absolute - is another 
reason ,  and by no means an insignificant one, for developing a new 
concept of space. 

VI 

Reduction is a scientific procedure designed to deal with the complexity 
and chaos of brute observations. This kind of simplification is necessary 
at first, but i t must be quickly fol lowed by the gradual restoration of 
what has thus been temporari ly set aside for the sake of ana lysis. 
Otherwise a methodological necessity may become a servitude, and the 



1 06 SOC I A L  S PACE 

legitimate operation of reduction may be transformed into the abuse of 
reductionism. This is a danger that ever l ies in wait for scientific endeav­
our. No method can obviate it, for i t is latent in every method. Though 
indispensable, all reductive procedures are also traps . 

Reductionism thus infiltrates science under the flag of science itself. 
Reduced models are constructed - models of society, of the city, of 
institutions, of the family, and so forth - and things are left at that . 
Th is is how social space comes to be reduced to mental space by means 
of a 'scientific' procedure whose scientific status is real ly nothing but a 
vei l for ideology. Reductionists are unstinting in their praise for basic 
scientific method, but they transform this method first into a mere 
posture and then, in the name of the 'science of science' (epistemology) , 
into a supposed absolute knowledge. Eventual ly, critical thought (where 
it is not proscribed by the orthodox) wakes up to the fact that systematic 
reduction and reductionism are part and parcel of a political practice. 
The state and political power seek to become, and indeed succeed 
in becoming, reducers of contradictions. In this sense reduction and 
reductionism appear as tools in the service of the state and of power: 
not as ideologies but as establ ished knowledge; and not in the service 
of any specific state or government, but rather in the service of the state 
and power in genera l . Indeed, how could the state and political power 
reduce contradictions ( i .e . incipient and renewed intrasocial confl icts) 
other than via the mediation of knowledge, and this by means of a 
strategy based on an admixture of science and ideology ? 

It is now genera l ly acknowledged that not too long ago a functional ism 
held sway which was reductionistic with respect to the real i ty and 
comprehension of societies; such functional reductionism is readily sub­
jected to criticism from all sides. What is not s imilarly acknowledged, 
and indeed passed over in si lence, is that structuralism and formalism 
propose, after their fashion, equally reductive schemata. They are 
reductionist in that they give a privileged status to one concept - because 
they extrapolate; conversely, their reductionism encourages them to 
extrapolate. And, when the need to correct this error, or to compensate 
for it, makes itself felt, ideology stands ready to step into the breach 
with its verbiage ( its ' ideological discourse', to use the jargon) and with 
its abuse of a l l  signs whether verbal or not. 

Reduction can reach very far indeed in its impl ications. It can 'descend' 
to the level of practice, for instance. Many people, members of a variety 
of groups and classes, suffer (a lbeit uneven ly) the effects of a multipl icity 
of reductions bearing on their capacities, ideas, 'values' and, u l timately, 
on their possibi l i ties, their space and their bodies. Reduced models 



SOC I A L  SPACE 1 07 
constructed by one particular special ist or other are not always abstract 
in the sense of being 'empty ' abstractions. Far from it, in fact: designed 
with a reductive practice in mind, they manage, with a little l uck, to 
impose an order, and to constitute the elements of that order. Urban ism 
a11d a rchitecture provide good examples of  this . The working class, in 
particu lar, suffers the effects of such ' reduced models ' ,  inc luding models 
of space, of consumption and of  so-ca l led culture. 

Reductionism presses an exclusively analytic and non-critical knowl­
edge, along with i ts attendant subdivisions and interpretations, into the 
service of power. As an ideology that does not speak its name, it 
successfu l ly passes itself off as 'scientific' - and this desp ite the fact that 
it rides roughshod over establ ished knowledge on the one hand and 
denies the possibi l i ty of knowing on the other .  Th is is the scientific 
ideology par excellence, for the reductionist attitude may be actual ized 
merely by passing from method to dogma, and thence to a homogenizing 
p ractice camouflaged as science. 

At the outset, as I pointed out above, every scientific undertaking 
must p roceed reductively. One of the misfortunes of  the special ist is that 
he makes this methodological moment into a permanent niche for 
h imsel f where he can curl up happi ly in the warm. Any special ist who 
clearly stakes out his ' field' may be sure that as long as he is prepared 
to work i t  a l ittle he will be able to grow someth ing there. The field he 
selects, and what he 'cultivates ' , are determined by the local conditions 
in his  specia l i ty and by that special ity's position in  the knowledge 
market. But these are precisely the things that the specia l i st does not 
want to know about. As for the reduction upon which his procedures 
are founded, he adopts a posture that serves in its own way to j ustify 
it :  a posture of denia l .  

Now, it is  hard to think of any special ized discipl ine that is not 
involved, immediately or mediately, with space. 

In the fi rst p lace, as we have a l ready learnt, each specia l ization stakes 
out its own particu lar  mental and social space, defining it in a somewhat 
arbitrary manner, carving it out from the whole constituted by 'nature/ 
society ', and at the same time concealing a portion of the activ i ty 
of segmentation and rearrangement involved in th is procedure (the 
sectioning-off of a ' field', the assembling of statements and reduced 
models relating to that field, and the shift from mental to socia l ) .  Al l  
of which necessari ly cal ls in addition for the adduction of propositions 
justifying - and hence interpreting - that activity . 

Secondly, a l l  specia l ists must work within the confines of systems for 
naming and classifying things found in space. The verification, descrip-



108 SOCIAL S PACE 

tion and classification of objects in space may be viewed as the 'positive' 
activity of  a particular special ization - of geography, say, or anthro­
pology, or sociology . At best (or at worst) a given discipline - as for 
example political science or 'systems analysis' - may concern itsel f with 
statements about space. 

Lastly, specia l ists may be counted on to oppose a reduced model of 
the knowledge of space (based either on the mere noting of objects in 
space or else on propositions concern ing - and segmenting - space) to 
any overa l l  theory of (socia l )  space. For them this stance has the added 
advantage of el iminating time by reducing it to a mere 'variable' . 

We should not, therefore, be particularly surprised i f the concept of 
the production of space, and the theory associated with it , were chal­
lenged by specia l i sts who view social space through the optic of their 
methodology and their reductionistic schemata. This is a l l the more l ikely 
in view of the fact that both concept and theory threaten interdiscipl inary 
boundaries themselves : they threaten, in other words, to alter, if not to 
erase, the specialists' carefu l ly drawn property l ines. 

Perhaps I may be permitted at this point to imagine a dialogue with 
an in terlocutor at once fictit ious (because indeed imaginary) and real 
(because his objections are real enough ) .  

' I  am not  convinced by your arguments. You talk of "producing 
space " What an absolutely un intel ligible phrase! Even to speak of 
a concept in th is connection would be to grant you far too much. 
No, there are only two possibi l ities here. Either space is part of 
nature or i t  is a concept. If it is part of nature, human - or " socia l" 
- activity marks i t ,  invests it and modifies its geographical and 
ecological characteristics; the role of knowledge, on th is reading, 
would be l imited to the description of these changes . If space is a 
concept, it is as such already a part of knowledge and of mental 
activ i ty, as in mathematics for example, and the job of scientific 
thought is to explore, elaborate upon and develop it . In neither 
case is there such a thing as the production of space . '  

'Just a moment. The separations you are taking for granted 
between nature and knowledge and nature and culture are simply 
not val id. They are no more valid than the widely accepted 
"mind-matter" split . These distinctions are simply no improve­
ment on their equal ly unacceptable opposite - namely, confusion. 
The fact is that technological activity and the scienti fic approach 
are not satisfied with simply modifying nature. They seek to master 
it, and in the process they tend to destroy it ; and, before destroying 



S O C I A L  SPACE 1 09 

it, they misinterpret it. Th is process began with the invention of 
tools. ' 

'So now you are going back to the Stone Age ! Isn't that a l i ttle 
early ? '  

'Not at a l l .  The beginning was the first premeditated act o f  
murder; the first tool and the first weapon - both of which went 
hand in hand with the advent of language . '  

'What you seem to be saying i s  that humankind emerges from 
nature. It can thus only understand nature from without - and it 
only gets to understand it by destroying it . ' 

'Well , if one accepts the general ization "humankind" for the 
sake of the argument, then, yes, humankind is born in nature, 
emerges from nature and then turns against nature with the unfor­
tunate results that we are now witnessing. ' 

'Would you say that th is ravaging of nature is attributable to 
capita l ism ? '  

'To a large degree, yes. But I would add the rider that capital ism 
and the bourgeoisie have a broad back. It is easy to attribute a 
multitude of misdeeds to them without addressing the question of 
ho� they themselves came into being. ' 

'Surely the answer is to be found in mankind itself, in human 
nature ? '  

'No. In the nature of Western man perhaps. ' 
'You mean to say that you would blame the whole h istory of 

the West, i ts rational ism, i ts Logos, i ts very language ? '  
' I t  is the West that is_responsible for the transgression of nature . 

It woufCrcertaiii°ly be interesting to know how and why "this has 
come a�out, but those questions are strictly secondary. Th� simple 
fact is that the West has broken the bounds. "O fel ix culpa ! "  a 
theologian might say. And, indeed, the West is thus responsible 
for what Hegel cal ls the power of the negative, for violence, terror 
and permanent aggression directed against l i fe . lt has generaliz.�q 
and global ized violence - and forged the globa)Jevel itse lf th rough 
that violence. Space as locus of production, as itself p_roduc.umd 
production, is both the weapon and the sign of this struggle. If it 
is to be carried through to the end - there is in anycase""llo way 
of turning back - this gigantic task now calls for the immediate 
production or creation of something other than nature :  a second, 
di fferent or new nature, so to speak. This means the . . production 
of space, urban space, both as a product and as a work, in the 
sense in which art created works. I f  this project fa ils, the fai lure

will be total , and the consequences of that are impossible to 
foresee. ' 

VII 

Every social space is the outcome of a process with many aspects and 
many contributing currents, signifying and non-signifying, perceived and 
directly experienced, practical and theoretica l .  In short, every socia l  
space has a h istory, one invariably grounded in nature, in natural 
conditions that are at once primordial and unique in the sense that they 
are always and everywhere endowed with specific characteristics (site, 
climate, etc. ) .  

When the history of a particu lar space i s  treated as such, the relation­
ship of that space to the time which gave rise to it takes on an aspect 
that differs sharply from the picture general ly accepted by h istorians. 
Traditional h istoriography assumes that thought can perform cross­
sections upon time, arresting its flow without too much difficulty; its 
analyses thus tend to fragment and segment temporality. In the h istory 
of space as such, on the other hand, the h istorical and diachronic realms 
and the generative past are forever leaving their inscriptions upon the 
writing-tablet, so to speak, of space. The uncertain traces left by events 
are not the only marks on (or in) space : society in its actual ity also 
deposits its script, the result and product of social activities. Time has 
more than one writing-system. The space engendered by time is a lways 
actual and synchronic, and it a lways presents itse lf as of a piece; its 
component parts are bound together by interna l l inks and connections 
themselves produced by time. 

Let us consider a primary aspect, the simplest perhaps, of the history 
of space as it proceeds from nature to abstraction. Imagine a time when 
each people that had managed to measure space had its own units of 
measurement, usually borrowed from the parts of the body: thumb's 
breadths, cubits, feet, palms, and so on. The spaces of one group, l ike 
their measures of duration, must have been unfathomable to al l others . 
A mutual interference occurs here between natural pecul iarities of space 
and the pecul iar nature of a given human group. But how extraordinary 
to think that the body should have been part and parcel of so idiosyn­
cratica l ly gauged a space. The body's relationship to space, a social 
relationship of an importance quite misapprehended in later times, sti l l 
retained in those early days an immediacy which would subsequently 



SOC I A L  SPACE 1 1 1  

degenerate and be lost: space, along with the way it was measured and 
spoken of, sti l l held up to al l the members of a society an image and a 
l iving reflection of their own bodies. 

The adoption of another people's gods always entai ls the adoption of 
their space and system of measurement. Thus the erection of the Pan­
theon in Rome pointed not only to a comprehension of conquered gods 
but also to a comprehension of spaces now subordinate to the master 
space, as it were, of the Empire and the world. 

The status of space and its measurement has changed only very slowly; 
indeed the process is sti l l far from complete. Even in France, cradle of 
the metric system, odd customary measures are sti l l used when it comes, 
for example, to garment or shoe sizes. As every French schoolch i ld 
knows, a revolution occurred with the imposition of the abstract gener­
a l i ty of the decimal system, yet we cont inue to make use of the duodeci­
mal system in deal ing with time, cycles, graphs, circumferences, spheres, 
and so on. Fluctuations in the use of measures, and thus in represen­
tations of space, parallel general history and indicate the direction it has 
taken - to wit, i ts trend towards the quantitative, towards homogeneity 
and towards the e l imination of the body, which has had to seek refuge 
in art. 

VIII 

As a way of approaching the history of space in a more concrete fashion, 
let us now for a moment examine the ideas of the nat ion and of 
national ism. How is the nation to be defined ? Some people - most, in 
fact - define i t as a sort of substance which has sprung up from nature 
(or more specifical ly from a territory with 'natural' borders) and grown 
to maturity within h istorical time. The nation is thus endowed with a 
consistent ' rea l i ty' which is perhaps more defini tive than well defined. 
This thesis, because it j ustifies both the bourgeoisie's national state and 
its general attitude, certa in ly suits that class's purposes when it promotes 
patriotism and even absolute nationalism as 'natural ' and hence eternal 
truths. Under the influence of Sta l in ism, Marxist thought has been 
known to endorse the same or a very similar position (with a dose of 
historicism thrown in for good measure ) .  There are other theorists, 
however, who maintain that the nation and national ism are merely 
ideological constructs. Rather than a 'substantial rea lity' or a body 
corporate, the nation is on this view scarcely more than a fiction 
projected by the bourgeoisie onto its own h istorical conditions and 



1 12 SOCIAL SPACE 
origins, to begin with as a way of magnifying these in imaginary fashion, 
and later on as a way of masking class contradictions and seducing the 
working class into an il lusory nationa l  so l idarity. It is easy, on the basis 
of this hypothesis, to reduce national and regional questions to l inguistic 
and cultural ones - that is to say, to matters of secondary importance. 
We are thus led to a kind of abstract internationalism. 

Both of these approaches to the question of the nation, the argument 
from nature and the argument from ideology, leave space out of the 
picture. The concepts used in both cases are developed in a mental space 
which thought eventually identifies with real space, with the space of 
social and political practice, even though the latter is really no more 
than a representation of the former, a representation itself subordinate 
to a specific representation of historical time. 

When considered in relationship to space, the nation may be seen to 
have two moments or cor;ditions. First, nationhood implies the existe.r1ce 
of a;�market_gra�ually built up over a historica l period....Qf varying length. 
Such a market is a complex ensemble of commercial relations and 
communication networks. It subordinates local or regional markets to 
the national one, and thus must have a hierarchy of levels. The social ,  
economic and political development of a national market has been 
somewhat different in character in places where the towns came very 
early on to dominate the country, as compared with places where the 
towns grew up on a pre-existing peasant, rural and feudal foundation. 
The outcome, however, is much the same everywhere: a focused space 
embodying a hierarchy of centres (commerci.al-GeAt-res-fo1�1osqran, 
buf·ars0rehg1ous-ones-;-•·c�lt�r-;1 ·  ones, and_ so  on )  aµP,_a.main cen(!L-
i.e. the national capital. 

- · 

Secondly, nationhood implies violence 1 the violence of-a mi lita�y 
state, be it feudal ,  bourgeois, imperialist� or some other variety. It 
iffiplles, in other words, a political power controlling and exPfoiting the 
resources of the market or the growth of the productive forces in order 
to maintain and further its rule. 

We have yet to ascertain the exact relationship between 'spontaneQlls' 
economic growth on the one hand and violence on the other, as well as 
their precise respective effects, but our hypothesis does affirm that_t�e 
two 'moments' indeed combine forces and produce a space: the W-�e 
of the nation state. Such a state cannot therefore be defined in terms of 
a s·ubstarrrive 'legal person' or in terms of a pure ideological fiction or 
'specula r  centre' . Yet to be evaluated, too, are the connections between 
nationa l  spaces of this kind and the world market, imperialism and its 
strategies, and the operational  spheres of multinational corporations. 



SOCIA L SPACE 1 1 3 

Let us now turn to a very general view of our subject. Producing an 
object invariably involves the modification of a raw materia l  by the 
appl ication to it of an appropriate knowledge, a technical procedure, 
an effort and a repeated gesture { labour) . The raw material comes, 
whether directly or indirectly, from nature: wood, wool, cotton, si lk, 
stone, meta l .  Over the centuries, more and more soph isticated - and 
hence less and less 'natura l '  - materials have replaced substances 
obtained directly from nature. The importance of technical and scientific 
mediation has increased constantly. One only has to think of concrete, 
of man-made fibres, or of plastics. I t is true, none the less, that many 
of the earl iest materials, such as wool, cotton, brick and stone, are sti l l 
with us. 

The object produced often bears traces of the materiel and time that 
have gone into its production - clues to the operations that have 
modified the raw material used. This makes it possible for us to recon­
struct those operations. The fact remains, however, that productive 
operations tend in the main to cover their tracks ; some even have this 
as their prime goal : polishing, sta in ing, facing, plastering, and so on. 
When construction is completed, the scaffolding is taken down; l ikewise, 
the fate of an author's rough drafr is to be torn up and tossed away, 
while for a painter the distinction between a study and a painting is a 
very clear one. It is for reasons such as these that products, and even 
works, are further characterized by their tendency to detach themselves 
from productive labour. So much so, in fact, that productive labour is 
sometimes forgotten al together, and i t is this ' forgetfulness' - or, as a 
phi losopher might say, this mystification - that makes possible the 
fetishism of commodities : the fact that commodities imply certa in social 
relationships whose misapprehension they also ensure. 

It is never easy to get back from the object (product or work) to the 
activity that produced and/or created it . It is the only way, however, to 
i l luminate the object's natu re, or, i f  you wil l , the object's relationship 
to nature, and reconsti tute the process of its genesis and the development 
oT i ts meaning. All other ways of proceeding can succeed only in 
constructing an abstract obje�. - a model .  I t is not sufficient, in any 
case, merely to bring out an object's structure and to understand that 
structure: we need to generate an object in its enti rety - that is, to 
reproduce, by and in thought, that object's forms, structures and func­
tions. 

How does one (where 'one' designates any 'subject') perceive a picture, 
a landscape or a monument ? Perception natura l ly depends on the 'sub­
ject' : a peasant does not perceive 'his ' landscape in the same way as a 



1 14 SOCI A L  SPACE 
town-dweller strol l ing through it. Take the case of a cultured art-lover 
looking at a painting. His eye is neither that of a professional nor that 
of an uncultivated person. He considers first one and then another of 
the objects depicted in the painting; he starts out by apprehending the 
relationships between these objects, and al lows h imsel f to experience 
the effect or effects intended by the painter. From this he derives a 
certain pleasure - assuming that the painting in question is of the type 
supposed to give pleasure to eye or mind. Bue our amateur is also aware 
that the picture is framed, and that the internal relations between colours 
and forms are governed by the work as a whole. He thus moves from 
consideration of the objects in the painting to consideration of the 
picture as an object, from what he has perceived in the pictural space 
to what he can comprehend about that space. He thus comes to sense 
or understand various 'effects ' ,  i ncluding some which have not been 
intentionally sought by the painter. He deciphers the pictu re and finds 
surprises in it, but a lways within the l imits of its formal framework, 
and in the ratios or proportions dictated by that framework. His dis­
coveries occur on the p lane of (pictura l )  space. At this point in his 
aesthetic inquiry, the 'subject' asks a number of questions :  he seeks to 
solve one problem in particular, that of the relationship between effects 
of meaning that have been sought by means of technique and those 
which have come about independently of the artist's intentions (some 
of which depend on him, the ' looker' ) .  In this way he begins to trace a 
path back from the effects he has experienced to the meaning-producing 
activ i ty that gave rise to them; his aim is to rediscover that activity and 
to try and identify (perhaps i l lusori ly ) with it . His 'aesthetic' perception 
thus operates, as one would expect, on several levels. 

It is not hard to see that this paradigm case is paral leled by a trend 
in the history of phi losophy that was taken up and advanced by Marx 
and by Marxist thought. The post-Socratic Greek phi losophers analysed 
knowledge as social practice ; reflecting the state of understanding itself, 
they inventoried the ways in which known objects were apprehended. 
The high-point of this theoretical work was Aristotel ian teaching on 
discourse (Logos) ,  and on the categories as at once elements of discourse 
and means for apprehending (or class ifying) objects. Much later, i n  
Europe, Cartesian phi losophy refined and modified the definition of 
'Logos' .  Phi losophers were now supposed to question the Logos - and 
put it into question : to demand its credentials, i ts pedigree, its cert ificate 
of origin, i ts citizenship papers. With Descartes, therefore, phi losophy 
sh i fted the posit ion of both questions and answers. It changed its focus, 
moving from 'thought thought' to 'th inking thought' , from the objects 



SOC I A L  S PACE 1 15 

of thought to the act of thinking, from a discourse upon the known to 
the operation of knowing. The result was a new 'problematic' - and 
new difficul ties. 

Marx recommenced this Cartesian revolution, perfecting and broaden­
ing it in the process. His concern was no longer merely with works 
generated by knowledge, but now also with things in i ndustrial practice. 
Following Hegel and the British economists, he worked his way back 
from the resu l ts of productive activity to productive activity itse lf. Marx 
concluded that any rea l i ty presenting itsel f in space can be expounded 
and explained in terms of its genesis in time. But any activity developed 
over ( h istorical ) time engenders {produces) a space, and can only attain 
practica l ' real ity' or concrete existence with in that space. This view of 
matters emerged in Marx's thinking only in an i l l -defined form ; it was 
in fact inherited by him in that form from Hegel . It appl ies to any 
landscape, to any monument, and to any spatial ensemble (so long as 
it is not 'given ' in nature), as it does to any picture, work or product. 
Once deciphered, a landscape or a monument refers us back to a creative 
capacity and to a sign i fying process. Th is capacity may in principle be 
dated, for it is a historical fact. Not, however, in the sense that an event 
can be dated : we are not referring to the exact date of a monument's 
inauguration, for example, or to the day that the command that it be 
erected was issued by some notabil ity. Nor is it a matter of a dare in 
the institutional sense of the word : the moment when a particu lar social 
organization acceded to a pressing demand that it embody itself in a 
particular edifice - the judiciary in a courthouse, for instance, or the 
Church in a cathedral. Rather, the creative capacity in questiolLhere is 
invariably that of a community or--col lectivity, of a group, of a fraction 
of a class in action, or of an: ' agent ' ( i .e. 'one who acts' ) .  Even .. though 
'commanding' and 'demanding' may be the functions of distinct groups, 
no individual or entity may be considered ult imately responsible for 
production itself : such responsibi l ity may be attributed only to a socia l 
real ity capable of investing· a space - capable, given the resources 
(productive forces, technology and knowledge, means of labour, etc . ) ,  
of producing that space. Manifestly, if a countryside exists, there must 
have been peasants to give it form, and hence too communities (v i l lages) ,  
whether autonomous or subject to a higher (politica l ) power. Simi larly, 
the existence of a monument implies its construction by an urban-group 
which may also be either free or subordinate to a (politica l )  authority. 
It is certainly necessary to descri be such states of affairs, but i t  is hardly 
sufficient. It would be utterly inadequate from the standpoint of an 
understanding of space merely to describe first rural landscapes, then 



1 1 6  SOCI A L  S PACE 

industrial landscapes, and final ly urban spatia l i ty , for this would simply 
leave al l transitions out of the picture. Inasmuch as the quest for the 
relevant productive capacity or creative process leads us in  many cases 
to political power, there arises the question of how such power is 
exercised. Does it merely command, or does it 'demand' also ? What is 
the nature of its rel ationship to the groups subordinate to it, which are 
themselves 'demanders', sometimes a lso 'commanders', and invariably 
'participants ' ?  Th is is a h istorical p�oblem - that of al l cities, a l l  monu­
ments, a l l landscapes. The analysis of any space brings us up against 
the dialectical relationship between demand and command, a long with 
its attendant questions : 'Who ? ' , 'For whom ?' , 'By whose agency ? ' ,  'Why 
and how ? '  If and when this dialectical (and hence conflictua l )  relation­
ship ceases to obtain - if demand were to outlive command, or vice 
versa - the history of space must come to an end. The same goes for 
the capacity to create, without a doubt. The production of space might 
proceed, but solely according to the dictates of Power :  production 
without creation - mere reproduction. But is it rea l ly possible for us to 
envision an end to demand ? Suffice it to say that si lence is not the same 
thing as quietus. 

What we are concerned with, then, is the long history of space, even 
though space is neither a 'subject' nor an 'object' -but rather a socia l  
real i ty - that is to say, a set -of rela_tjons and forms. This h istory is to 
be distinguished from an inventory of things in space (or wbat has 
recently been call"ed material cu-ltur��or civi l ization ) ,  -as also from ideas 
and discourse about space. It must account for both representational 
spaces and representatio.ns of space, but �bove al l  for_ their interrelation­
ships and their l inks with social practice. The history of space thus has its 
plac� between anthropology and p_olitic�l economy-:-The nomenclature, 
description ancf .Classification of objects certainly has a contri bution to 
make to traditional h istory, especial ly when the h istorian is concerned 
with the ordina ry objects of dai ly l i fe, with types of food, kitchen 
utensils and the preparation and presentation of meals, with cloth ing, 
or with the bui lding of houses and the materia ls and materiel it cal ls 
for. But everyday l i fe also figures in representational spaces - or perhaps 
it would be more accurate to say that it forms such spaces. As for 
representations of space (and of time), they a re part of the h istory of 
ideologies, provided that the concept of ideology is not restricted, as it 
too often is, to the ideologies of the phi losophers and of the ru ling 
classes - or, in other words, tQ the 'noble' ideas of phi losqphy, rel igion 
and ethics. A history of space would expla in the development, and hence 
the temporal conditions� of those realities which some gengraphers c_ali 



SOCI A L  S PACE 1 1 7 

'networks' and which are subordi nated to the frameworks....o.Lp.alitics. 
The h istory of space does not have to choose between 'processes' 

and 'structures ' ,  change and invariabi l i ty, events and institutions. Its 
periodizations, moreover, will di ffer from genera l ly accepted ones. Nat­
ural l y, the h istory of space should not be distanced in any way from 
the history of time (a h istory clearly distinct from al l philosophical 
theories of time in genera l ) .  The departure point for this h istory of space 
is not to be found in geographical descriptions of natura l space, but 
rather in the study of natural rhythms, and of the modification of those 
rhythms and their inscription in space by means of human actions, 
especia l ly work-related actions. It begins, then, with the spatio-tempo_ra l  
rhy'thms of nature as transformed by a socia l practice. 

The first determinants to consider will be anthropological ones, necess­
ari ly bound up with the elementary forms of the appropriation of nature: 
numbers, opposi tions and symmetries, images of the world, myths.6 In 
deal ing with these elaborated forms, it is often hard to separate knowl­
edge from symbolism, practice from theory, or denotation from conno­
tation ( in the rhetorical sense ) ; the same goes for the distinctions between 
spati a l arrangements (subdivision, spacing) and spatia l interpretations 
( representations of space ) ,  and between the activities of partial groups 
( fami ly , tribe, etc . )  and those of global societies. At the most primitive 
level, behind or beneath these elaborate forms, lie the very earliest 
demarcations and orienting markers of hunters, herders and nomads, 
which would eventually be memorized, designated and invested with 
symbol ism . 

Thus mental and social activity impose their own meshwork upon 
nature's space, upon the Heraclitean flux of spontaneous phenomena, 
upon that chaos which precedes the advent of the body; they set up an 
order which, as we shal l see, coincides, but only up to a point, with the 
order of words. 

Traversed now by pathways and patterned by networks, natural space 
changes : one might say that practica l activity writes upon nature, a lbeit 
in a scrawling hand, and that this writ ing implies a particular r�P.r._e,sen-

tation of space. Places are marked, noted, named. Between them, within 
the 'holes in  the net', are blank or marginal spaces. Besides Holzwege 
or woodland paths, there a re paths through fields and pastures. Paths 
are more important than the traffic they bear, because they are what 
endures in the form of the reticu lar patterns left by animals, both wild 
and domestic, and by people ( i n  and around the houses of vi l lage or 
small town, as in the town's immediate environs) . Always distinct and 
clearly indicated, such traces embody the 'values' assigned to particular 
routes : danger, safety, waiting, promise. This graphic aspect, which was 
obviously not apparent to the original 'actors' but which becomes quite 
clear with the aid of modern-day cartography, has more in common 
with a spider's web than with a drawing or plan. Could it be cal led a 
text, or a message ? Possibly, but the analogy would serve no particu larly 
useful purpose, and it would make more sense to speak of texture rather 
than of texts in this connection. Similarly, it is helpfu l  to think of 
architectures as 'archi-textures', to treat each monument or bui lding, 
viewed in its surroundings and context, i n  the populated area and 
associated networks in which it is set down, as part of a particular 
production of space. Whether th is approach can he lp clarify spatial 
practice is a question to which we shal l be return ing. 

Time and space are not separable within a texture so conceived : space 
impl ies time, and vice versa . These networks are not closed, but open 
on all sides to the strange and the foreign, to the threatening and the 
propitious, to friend and foe. As a matter of fact, the abstract distinction 
between open and closed does not rea l ly apply here. 

What modes of existence do these paths assume at those times when 
they are not being actual ized through practice, when they enter into 
representational spaces ? Are they perceived as lying within nature or as 
outside it? The answer is neither, for at such times people animate these 
paths and roads, networks and itineraries, through accounts of mythical 
'presences', genies and good or evil spirits, which are conceived of as 
having a concrete existence. There is doubtless no such thing as a myth 
or symbol unassocia ted with a mythical or symbolic space which is also 
determined by practice. 

It is certa inly not impossi ble, moreover, that such anthropological 
determinants, carried down through the centuries by a particu lar group, 
perhaps abandoned only to be taken up once more, displaced or trans­
ferred, should have surv ived into the present. On the other hand, careful 
investigation is called for before any conclusions can possibly be drawn 
about structural invariabi l ity or patterns of repetition and reproduction.

Let us turn with this in mind to the case of Florence. 7 In 1 1 72 the 
commune of Florence reorganized its urban space in response to the 
growth of the town, its traffic and its ju risdiction. This was an undertak­
ing of global intent, not a matter of separate architectural projects each 
having its own repercussions on the city ; it included a town square, 
wh.arves, bridges and roads. The h istorian can fairly easily trace the 
interplay of command and demand in this instance. The 'demanders' 
were those people who wished to benefit from the protections and 
advantages, including an improved enceinte, that the city could vouch­
safe them. The command aspect stemmed from an ambitious authority, 
with the wherewithal to back up its ambitions. The Roman walls were 
abandoned, and the four existing city gates were replaced by six main 
gates and four secondary ones on the right bank of the Arno, and three 
more in the Oltrarno, which was now incorporated into the city. The 
urban space thus produced had the form of a symbolic flower, the rose 
des vents or compass-card. Its configuration was thus in accord with an 
imago mundi, but the historian of space ought not to attribute the same 
degree of importance to this representational space, wh ich originated in 
a far distant and far di fferent place, as he does to the upheavals which 
were s imultaneously transforming the contado or Tuscan countryside 
and its relationship to its centre, namely Florence, giving rise in the 
process to a new representation of space. The fact i s that what was 
anthropological ly essential in ancient times can become purely tangential 
in the course of history. Anthropologica l factors enter h istory as 
material, apt to be treated variously according to the circumstances, 
conjunctures, avai lable resources and materiel used. 8 The process of 
h istorical change, which entai l s al l kinds of displacements, substitutions 
and transfers, subordinates both materia ls and materiel. In Tuscany we 
have a period of transition from a representational space (an image of 
the world ) to a representation of space, namely perspective. This al lows 
us to date an important event in the history under consideration . 

The h istory of space wil l begin at the point where anthropological

factors lose their supremacy and end with the advent of a production 
of space which is  expressly industrial in  nature - a space in which 
reproducibi l i ty, repetition and the reproduction of socia l  relationships 
are deli berately given precedence over works, over natural reproduction, 
over nature itsel f and over natural t ime. This area of study overlaps 
with no other. I t  is clearly circumscri bed, for this history has a beginning 
and an end - a preh istory and a 'post-h istory ' .  In prehistory, nature 
dominates soci.alsp.ace ; jn post-history, a loca l ized nature recedes. Thus 
demarcated, th_e h istory of space is lndispensaole. Neither i ts be-ginning 
nor its end can be dated in the sense in which -traditional h istoriography 
dates events. The beginning alone took up a period traces of which 
remain even now in our houses, vi l l ages and towns. In the course of 
this process, which may be properly referred to as h istorica l ,  certain 
abs.tract relations were established : exchange value became genera l ,  first 
th@ks ro�:.SilveJ .and gold ( i . e.;::__theii_ func.tions) ,  then thanks to capital .  
These abstractions, which are socia l  relations implying forms;-&ecome 
tangible in two ways. In the fi rst place, the instrument and general 
equivalent of exchange value, namely money, takes on concrete form in 
coins, in  'pieces' of money_ Secondly, the commercial relations which 
the use of money presupposes and induces atta in social existence only 
once they are projected onto the terrain in .  the shape of relational 
networks (communications, markets) and of hierarchically organized 
centres ( towns) .  It must be presumed that in each period a certain  
balance is established between the  centres ( i . e .  the  functioning of each 
one) and the whole. One might therefore quite reasonably speak here 
of  'systems' ( urban, commercia l ,  etc. ) ,  but th is i s  real ly only a minor 
aspect, an impl ication and consequence of that fundamental activ ity 
which is the production of space. 

With the twentieth century, we are general ly supposed to have entered 
the modern era .  Despite - and because of - thei r famil iarity, however, 
such crude terms as 'century', 'modern' and 'modernity' serve to conceal 
more than one paradox ; these notions are in fact in urgent need of 
analysis and refinement. So far as space is concerned, decisive changes 
occurred at th is j uncture which are effectively obscu red by invariant, 
surviving or stagnant elements, especial ly on the plane of represen­
tational space. Consider the house, the dwell ing. In the cities - and even 
more so in the 'u rban fabric' wh ich proliferates around the cities pre­
cisely because of their disintegration - the House has a merely historico­
poetic real i ty rooted in folklore, or (to put the best face on it )  in 
ethnology. This memory, however, has an obsessive qual i ty :  it persists 
in a rt, poetry, drama and philosophy .  What is more, it runs th rough

the terrible urban real i ty which the twentieth century has instituted, 
embell ishing it with a nostalgic aura while also suffusing the work of 
its critics. Thus both Heidegger's and Bachelard's writings - the import­
ance and influence of which are beyond question - deal with th is i dea 
in a most emotional and indeed moving way. The dwelling passes 
everywhere for a specia l , still sacred, quasi-religious and in fact almost 
absolute space. With his 'poetics of space' and 'topophi l ia ' , Bachelard 
l inks representational spaces, which he travels through as he dreams 
(and which he distinguishes from representations of space, as developed 
by science ) ,  with this intimate and absolute space.9 The contents of the 
House have an almost ontological dignity in Bachelard :  drawers, chests 
and cabinets are not far removed from their natural analogues, as 
perceived by the phi losopher-poet, namely the basic figures of nest, 
shel l , corner, roundness, and so on. In the background, so to speak, 
stands Nature - maternal i f not uterine. The House is as much cosmic 
as it i s  human. From cel lar to attic, from foundations to roof, it has a 
density at once dreamy and rational, earth ly and celestia l . The relation­
ship between Home and Ego, meanwhile, borders on identity. The shell, 
a secret and directly experienced space, for Bachelard epitomizes the 
virtues of human 'space ' .  

As for Heidegger's ontology - his notion of building as close to 
thinking, and his scheme according to which the dwel l ing stands opposed 
to a wandering existence but is perhaps destined one day to a l ly with 
it i n  order to welcome in Being - this ontology refers to things and non­
things which are also far from us now precisely inasmuch as they are 
close to nature: the jug, 1 0  the peasant house of the Black Forest, 1 1 the 
Greek temple. 1 2  And yet space - the woods, the track - is nothing more 
and noth ing other than 'being-there' , than beings, than Dasein . And, 
even i f  Heidegger asks questions about its origin, even i f  he poses 
'historica l '  questions in this connection, there can be no doubt about 
the main thrust of his thinking here :  time counts for more than space ;  
Being ha s  a history, and history i s  nothing bu t  the History of Being.

This leads him to a restricted and restrictive conception of production, 
which he envisages as a causing-to-appear, a process of emergence which 
brings a thing forth as a thing now present amidst other already-present 
things. Such quasi-tautologica l  propositions add l ittle to Heidegger's 
admirable if enigmatic formulation according to which 'Dwel l ing is the 
basic character of Being in keeping with which morta ls exist. ' 1 3  Langu­
age for Heidegger, meantime, is simply the dwel l ing of Being. 

This obsession with absolute space presents obstacles on every side 
to the kind of history that we have been discussing (the h istory of 
space I the space of history ; representations of space I representational 
space) .  It pushes us back towards a purely descriptive understanding, 
for it stands opposed to any analytic approach and even more to any 
global account of the generative process in which we are interested. 
More than one specific and partial discipl ine has sought to defend this 
stance, notably anthropology (whose aims may readily be gauged from 
the qualifiers so often assigned to i t :  cultural, structural, etc. ) .  It is from 
motives of this sort that anthropology lays hold of notions derived from 
the study of vi l lage l i fe (usual ly the Bororo or Dagon vi l lage, but 
occasionally the Proven�al or Alsatian one), or from the consideration 
of traditional dwel l ings, and, by transposing and/or extrapolating them, 
applies these notions to the modern world. 

How is it that such notions can be transferred in this way and sti l l  
retain any meaning at al l ? There are a number of reasons, but the 
principal one is nostalgia. Consider the number of people, particularly 
young people, who flee the modern world, the difficult l i fe of the cities, 
and seek refuge in the country, in folk traditions, in arts and crafts or 
in anachronistic small -scale farming. Or the number of tourists who 
escape into an elitist (or would-be elit ist) existence in underdeveloped 
countries, including those bordering the Mediterranean. Mass migrations 
of tourist hordes into rustic or urban areas which their descent only 
helps to destroy (woe unto Venice and Florence ! )  are a manifestation 
of a major spatial contradiction of modernity : here we see space being 
consumed in both the economic and the literal senses of the word . 

The modern world's brutal l iquidation of h istory and of the past 
proceeds in a very uneven manner. In some cases entire countries -
certain Islamic countries, for example - are seeking to slow down 
industrialization so as to preserve their traditional homes, customs and 
representational spaces from the buffeting of industrial space and indus­
trial representations of space. There are other - very modern - nations 

1.1 Heidegger, 'Bui lding Dwe l l ing Thinking', in Poetry, Language, Thought, p. 1 60. 



SOCIAL SPACE 1 23 
which also try to maintain their l iving-arrangements and spaces 
unchanged, along with the customs and representations which go a long 
with them. In Japan, for instance, wh ich is a hyper-industrial ized and 
hyper-urbanized nation, traditional l iving-quarters, dai ly l i fe, and rep­
resen tational spaces survive intact - and this not in any merely folkloric 
sense, not as relics, not as stage management for tourists, not as con­
sumption of the cultural past, but indeed as immediate practical 'real ity '  
This intrigues visitors, frustrates Japanese modernizers and technocrats, 
and del igh ts humanists. There is an echo here, a lbeit a distant one, of 
the West's infatuation with vi l lage l i fe and rustic homesteads. 

This kind of perseveration is what makes Amos Rapoport's book on 
the 'anthropology of the home' so interesting. 1 4  The traditional peasant 
house of the Perigord is indeed just as worthy of study as those anthropo­
logical loci classici, the Eskimo's igloo and the Kenyan 's hut. The 
l imitations of anthropology are nonetheless on display here, and indeed 
they leap off the page when the author seeks to establish the general 
validity of reductionistic schemata based on a binary opposition - i.e. 
does the dwel l ing strengthen or does i t  reduce domesticity ? - and goes 
so far as to assert that French people always ( ! )  entertain in ca fes rather 
than at home. 1 5  

Much as they might l ike to, anthropologists cannot hide the  fact that 
the space and tendencies of modern i ty ( i .e . of modern capital ism) wi l l 
never be discovered either in Kenya or among French or any other 
peasants. To put studies such as these forward as of great importance 
in this connection is to avoid reality, to sabotage the search for knowl­
edge, and to tu rn one's back on the actual 'problematic' of  space. I f  we 
are to come to grips with this 'problematic', instead of turning to 
ethnology, ethnography or anthropology we must address our attention 
to the 'modern' world itself, with its dual aspect - capital ism, modern i ty 
- which makes it so hard to discern clearly. 

The raw material of the production of space is not, as i n  the case of 
particular objects, a particular materia l : it is rather nature itse lf, nature 
transformed into a product, rudely manipulated, now th reatened in its 
very existence, probably ruined and certainly - and most paradoxical ly 
- localized. 

It might be asked at this juncture if there is any way of dating what 
might be cal led the moment of emergence of an awareness of space and 
its production : when and where, why and how, did a neglected know!-

edge and a misconstrued real i ty begin to be recognized ? I t so happens 
that this emergence can indeed be fixed : i t  is to be found in the 'h istoric' 
role of the Bauhaus. Our critica l analysis will touch on this movement 
at several points. For the Bauhaus did more than locate space in its real 
context or supply a new perspective on it: it developed a new conception, 
a global concept, of space. At that time, around 1 920, just after the 
First World War, a l ink was discovered in the advanced countries 
(France, Germany, Russia, the United States ) ,  a l ink which had al ready 
been dealt with on the practical plane but which had not yet been 
ra tional ly articulated : that between industrialization and urbanization, 
between workplaces and dwel l ing-places. No sooner had this l ink been 
incorporated into theoretical thought than it turned into a project, even 
into a programme. The curious thing is that this 'programmatic' stance 
was looked upon at the time as both rationa l  and revolutionary, a lthough 
in reality i t was tai lor-made for the state - whether of the state-capita l ist 
or the state-socia l ist variety. Later, of course, this would become obvious 
- a truism. For Gropius or for Le Corbusier, the programme boiled 
down to the production of space. As Paul Klee put it, artists - painters, 
sculptors or architects - do not show space, they create it . The Bauhaus 
people understood that things could not be created independently of 
each other in space, whether movable ( furniture) or fixed (bu i ldings), 
without taking into account their interre lationships and their relation­
ship to the whole. It was impossible simply to accumulate them as a 
mass, aggregate or col lection of items . In the context of the productive 
forces, the technological means and the specific problems of the modern 
world, things and objects could now be produced in their relationsh ips, 
along with their relationsh ips. Formerly ,  artistic ensembles - monu­
ments, towns, furnishings - had been created by a variety of artists 
according to subjective criteria :  the taste of princes, the intel l igence of 
rich patrons or the genius of the artists themselves. Architects had thus 
bui l t palaces designed to house specific objects ( ' furniture') associated 
with an aristocratic mode of l i fe, and, a longside them, squares for the 
people and monuments for socia l  institutions. The resulting whole might 
constitute a space with a particular style, often even a dazzling style -
but it was sti l l a space never rationally defined which came into being 
and disappeared for no clear reason. As he considered the past and 
viewed it in the l ight of the present, Gropius sensed that henceforward 
socia l  practice was destined to change. The production of spatial 
ensembles as such corresponded to the capacity of the productive forces, 
and hence to a specific rational ity. It was thus no longer a question of 
in troducing forms, functions or structures in isolation, but rather one

of mastering global space by bringing forms, functions and structures 
together in accordance with a unitary conception. This insight confirmed 
after its fashion an idea of Marx's, the idea that industry has the power 
to open before our eyes the book of the creative capacities of 'man' ( i .e . 
of socia l  being) . 

The Bauhaus group, as artists associated in order to advance the total

rt, discovered, along with Klee, 16 that an observer 

could move around any object in social space - including such objects 
as houses, publ ic buildings and palaces - and in so doing go beyond 
scrutinizing or studying it under a single or special aspect. Space opened 
up to perception, to conceptual ization, just as it did to practical action .  
And the artist passed from objects in space to the concept of space 
itse l f. Avant-garde painters of the same period reached very similar 
conclusions : al l aspects of an object could be considered simultaneously, 
and this s imultaneity preserved and summarized a temporal sequence. 
This had several consequences. 

1 A new consciousness of space emerged whereby space (an object 
in its surroundings) was explored, sometimes by deliberately 
reducing it to its outline or plan and to the flat surface of the 
canvas, and sometimes, by contrast, by breaking up and rotating 
planes, so as to reconsti tute depth of space in the picture plane. 
This gave rise to a very specific dialectic. 

2 The fai;ade - as face directed towards the observer and as 
privileged side or aspect of a work of art or a monument -
disappeared. (Fascism, however, placed an increased emphasis 
on fac;ades, thus opting for total 'spectacularization' as eariy as 
the 1 920s. ) 

3 Global space established itsel f in the abstract as a void waiting 
to be fi l led, as a medium waiting to be colonized. How this 
could be done was a problem solved only later by the social 
practice of capitalism : eventual ly, however, this space would 
come to be fi lled by commercial images, signs and objects . Th is 
development would in turn result in the advent of the pseudo­
concept of the environment (which begs the question : t'?J 
environment of whom or of what ? ) .  

The historian of space who is concerned with modernity may qu ite 
confidently affirm the h istoric role of the Bauhaus. By the 1 920s the 

1 6  In 1 920 Klee had this to say: 'Art does not reflect the visi ble; i t  renders v is ible.' 



126  SOCIAL SPACE 

great phi losophical systems had been left behind, and, aside from the 
investigations of mathematics and physics, all thinking about space and 
time was bound up with social practice - more precisely, with industrial 
practice, and with architectural and urbanistic research. This transition 
from philosophical abstraction to the analysis of social practice is worth 
stressing. Whi le it was going on, those responsible for it, the Bauhaus 
group and others, believed that they were more than innovators, that 
they were in fact revolu tionaries. With the benefit of fifty years of 
hindsight, it is clear that such a claim cannot legitimately be made for 
anyone in that period except for the Dadaists (and, with a number of 
reservations, a few surreal ists) . 

It is easy enough to establ ish the h istoric role of the Bauhaus, but not 
so easy to assess the breadth and l imits of th is role. Did it cause or 
justify a change of aesthetic perspective, or was it merely a symptom of 
a change in socia l  practice ? More l ikely the latter, pace most h istorians 
of art and archi tecture. When it comes to the question of what the 
Bauhaus's audacity produced in the long run, one is obl iged to answer : 
the worldwide, homogeneous and monotonous architecture of the state, 
whether capitalist or social ist . 

How and why did this happen ? I f  there is such a thing as the history 
of space, i f space may indeed be said to be specified on the basis 
of h istorical periods, societies, modes of production and relations of 
production, then there is such a thing as a space characteristic of 
capitalism - that is, characteristic of that society which is run and 
dominated by the bourgeoisie. It is certainly arguable that the writings 
and works of the Bauhaus, of Mies van der Rohe among others, outl ined, 
formulated and helped real ize that particu lar space - the fact that 
the Bauhaus sought to be and proclaimed itsel f to be revolutionary 
notwithstanding. We shal l have occasion to discuss this irony of 'History ' 
at some length l ater on. 1 7  

The first initiative taken towards the development o f  a h istory of 
space was Siegfried Giedeon 's . 1 8  Giedeon kept his distance from practice 
but worked out the theoretical object of any such h istory in some deta i l ;  
he put space, and not some creative genius, not the 'spirit of the times', 
and not even technologica l progress, at the centre of history as he 
conceived it. A�J;prdin_g_�o Giedeon -ther.e...hav.e. . .  been chm;_ �ucces§ive

p�riods. During the first of these (ancient Egypt and Greece) , arch itec­
tural volumes were conceived and real ized in the context of their social 
relationships - and hence from without. The Roman Pantheon i l l ustrates 
a second conception, under which the interior�pace of the m01iliment 
became paramount . Our own period, by contrast, supposedly seeks to 
surmount the exterior-interior dichotomy by grasping an interaction or 
unity between these two spatial aspects. Actually, Giedeon succeeds here 
only in inverting the rea l i ty of social space .  The fact is that the Pantheon, 
as an image of the world or mundus, i s an opening to the l ight ;  the 
imago mundi, the interior hemisphere or dome, symbol izes this exterior. 
As for the Greek temple, i t encloses a sacred and consecrated space, the 
space of a localized divinity and of a divine locality, and the political 
centre of the city. 1 9  The source of such confusion is to be found in an 
initial error of Giedeon's, echoes of which occur throughout his work: 
he posits a pre-existing space - Euclidean space - in which al l human 
emotions and expectations proceed to invest themselves and make them­
selves tangible. The spiritualism latent in this phi losophy of space 
emerges clearly in  Giedeon's later work The Eternal Present.20 Giedeon 
was indeed never able to free h imself from a na'ive osci l lation between 
the geometrica l and the spiritualistic. A further problem was that he 
fai led to separate the history he was developing from the history of art 
and architecture, although the two are certainly quite different. 

The idea that space is essential ly empty but comes to be occupied by 
visual messages also l imits the th inking of Bruno Zevi .2 1 Zevi holds chat 
a geometrical space is animated by the gestures and actions of those 
who inhabit it . He reminds us, in a most timely manner, of the basic 
fact that every bui lding has an interior as well as an exterior. This 
means that there is an architectural space defined by the inside-outside 
relationship, a space which is a tool for the architect in his social action .  
The remarkable thing here, surely, is that i t should be necessary to recal l 
this dual ity several decades after the Bauhaus, and in Italy to boot, 
supposedly che 'birthplace' of archi tecture. We are obl iged to conclude 
that the critical analysis of the fa<;ade mentioned above has simply 
never taken hold, and that space has remained strictly visual, entirely 
subordinate to a ' logic of visual ization' .  Zevi considers that the visual 
conception of space rests upon a bodily (gestura l )  component which the

trained eye of the expert observer must take into account. Zevi 's book 
brings this ' l ived' aspect of spatial experience, which thanks to its 
corporal nature has the capacity to ' incarnate', into the realm of knowl­
edge, and hence of 'consciousness' , without ever entertaining the idea 
that such a bodily component of optical (geometrico-visua l )  space might 
put the priority of consciousness i tsel f into question. He does not appear 
to understand the impl ications of his findings beyond the pedagogical 
sphere, beyond the tra in ing of architects and the education of con­
noisseurs, and he certain ly does not pursue the matter on a theoretical 
level. In the absence of a viewer with an acquired mastery of space, 
how could any space be adjudged 'beautifu l '  or 'ugly', asks Zevi ,  and 
how could this aesthetic yardstick attain its primordial value ? To answer 
one question with another, how could a constructed space subjugate or 
repel otherwise than through use ?n

so conceived that i t will undergo a serious transformation. Its objectiv ity 
wil l be deepened inasmuch as it wil l come to bear no longer solely upon 
the production of things and works, and upon the (dual ) h istory of that 
production, but will reach out to take in space and time and, using 
nature as its 'raw material ' , broaden the concept of production so as to 
include the production of space as a process whose product - space -
itself embraces both things (goods, objects) and works. 

The outl ine of h istory, i ts 'compendium' and ' index' ,  is not to be 
found merely in phi losophies, but also beyond philosophy, in that

production which embraces concrete and abstract, h istoricizing both 
instead of leaving them in the sphere of phi losoph ical absolutes. Likewise 
history is thus thoroughly relativized instead of being made into a 
substitute metaphysics or 'ontology of becoming' . This gives real mean­
ing to the dist inctions between prehistorica l ,  h istorical and post-h i stori­
cal . Thus the properly historical period of the h istory of space corre­
sponds to the accumulation of capital , beginning with its primitive stage 
and ending with the world market under the reign of abstraction. 

As for dialectica l material ism, it also is ampl ified, verified - and 
transformed. New dialectics make their appearance : work versus prod­
uct, repetition versus difference, and so on. The dialectical movement 
immanent to the division of labour becomes more complex when viewed 
in the light of an exposition of the relationship between productive 
activity (both global labour - i.e. social labour - and divided or par­
cel led-out labour) and a specific product, unique in that it is also itsel f 
a tool - namely, space. The al leged ' reality' of space as natural substance 
and i ts a l leged 'unreal i ty ' as transparency are simultaneously exploded 
by this advance in our th inking. Space sti l l  appears as ' real ity' inasmuch 
as it is the milieu of accumulation, of growth , of commodities, of money, 
of capita l ;  but th is ' real ity' loses its substantia l and autonomous aspect 
once its development - i.e. its production - is traced . 

There is one question which has remained open in the past because 
it has never been asked : what exactly is the mode of existence of social 
relationships ? Are_ they substantia l ?  

·
n.aturaf? or form� l ly abstract ? The 

study of space offers an answer according to which the social 
·
r!!lations 

of production have a social existence to the extent that they have a 
spatial existence; they project themselves into a space, becoming 
inscribed there, and in the process producing that space itsel f. Fai l ing 
this, these rel ations would remain in the realm of 'pure' abstraction -
that is to say, in the realm of representations and hence...o.f ideology : 
the rea lm of verbal ism,_ ygbiage and..empty w.o.rds. 

Space itsel( at once a product of the capitalist mode of production 
and an economico-political instrument of the bourgeoisie, will now be 
seen to embody i ts own contradictions. The dialectic thus emerges from 
time and actual izes itsel f, operating now, in an unforeseen manner, in 
space. The contradictions of space, without abolishing the contradictions 
which arise from historical time, leave h istory behind and transport 
those old contradictions, i n  a worldwide simultaneity, onto a h igher 
level ; there some of them are blunted, others exacerbated, as this contra­
dictory whole takes on a new meaning and comes to designate 'some­
thing else' - another mode of production .

Not everything has been said - far from it - about the inscription of 
time in space : that is, about the temporal process which gives rise to, 
which produces, the spatial dimension - whether we are concerned with 
bodies, with society, with the universe or with the world. 

Phi losophy has left us but the poorest of indications here. The world 
is described as a sequence of i l l -defined events occurring in the shadows. 
The Cosmos amounts to a luminous simultaneity. Heraclitus and his 
fol lowers propose an ever-new universal flux which carries 'beings' 
along and in which al l stability is merely appearance. For the Eleatics, 
on the other hand, only stabil ity constitutes the 'real' world and renders 
it intell igible, so that any change is merely appearance. Hence the 
absolute primacy of now difference (a lways and continual ly - and 
tragica l ly - the new) , now repetition (always and everywhere - and 
comically - the same thing over and over aga in ) .  For some, then, space 
means decline, ruin - a slipping out of time as time itself sl ips out of 
(eterna l )  Being. As a conglomeration of things, space separates, disperses, 
and shatters unity, enveloping the finite and concealing its finiteness. 
For others, by contrast, space is the cradle, birthplace and medium of 
nature's communications and commerce with society ; thus it is always 
fertile - always full of antagonisms and/or harmonies. 

It is surely a l i ttle-explored view of time and space which proposes 
that time's self-actualization in space develops from a kernel ( i .e. from 
a relative and not an absolute origin ) , that this actualizing process is 
l iable to run into difficulties, to halt for rest and recuperation, that it 
may even at such moments turn in upon itself, upon its own inner 
un iqueness as both recourse and resource, before starting up again and 
continuing unti l i t reaches its point of exhaustion. 'Feedback', to the 
extent that it played any part at all in such a view of things, would not 
set in morion a system appropriate to the moment ; rather, it would 
establ ish synchrony with that diach ronic unity which never disappears 
from any l iving ' being' . As for time's aforementioned inner resources, 
and fundamental avai labi l ity, these stem from the real origins.

I have a l ready ventured a few statements concerning the relations 
between language and space. It is not certain that systems of non-verbal 



SOC I A L  SPACE 1 3 1  
� answer t o  the same concepts and categories a s  verbal systems, or 
even that they are properly systems at a l l ,  s ince their elements and 
moments are related more by contiguity and similarity than by any 
coherent systematization .  The question, however, is st i l l an open one. 
It is true that parts of space, like parts of discourse, are articulated in 
terms of reciprocal inclusions and exclusions. In language as in space, 
there is a before and an after, while the present dominates both past 
and future. 

The following, therefore, are perfectly legit imate questions. 

1 Do the spaces formed by practico-social activity, whether land­
scapes, monuments or bui ldings, have meaning? 

• 2 Can the space occupied by a social group or several such groups 
be treated as a message ? 

3 Ought we to look upon architectural or urbanistic works as a 
type of mass medium, a lbeit an unusual one ? 

4 May a social space viably be conceived of as a language or 
discourse, dependent upon a determinate practice ( reading/ 
writing) ? 

The answer to the first question must, obviously, be yes . The second 
calls for a more ambiguous 'yes and no' : spaces contain messages - but 
can they be reduced to messages ? It is tempting to reply that they imply 
more than that, that they embody functions, forms and structures quite 
unconnected with discourse. This is an issue that ca l l s for careful scru­
tiny. As for the third and fourth questions, our replies will have to 
include the most serious reservations, and we shal l be returning to them 
later. 

We can be sure, at any rate, that an understanding of language and 
of verbal and non-verba l systems of signs wil l be of great uti l ity in any 
attempt to understand space. There was once a tendency to study each 
fragment or element of space separately, seeking tO relate it to i ts own 
particular past - a tendency to proceed, as it were, etymological ly. 
Today, on the other hand, the preferred objects of study are ensembles, 
configurations or textu res . The resul t  is an extreme formalism, a fetishiz­
ation of consistency in knowledge and of coherence in practice : a cult, 
in short, of words. 

This trend has even generated the claim that d iscourse and thought 
have nothing to express but themselves, a position which leaves us with 
no truth, but merely with 'meaning' ; with room for 'textua l '  work, and 
such work only. Here, however, the theory of space has someth ing to 



1 32 SOCIA L SPACE 
contri bute. Every language is located in a space. Every discourse says 
someth ing about a space (places or sets of pl aces) ; and every d iscourse 
is emitted from a space. Distinctions must be drawn between discourse 
in space, discourse about space and the discourse of space. There are 
thus relationships between language and space which are to a greater 
or lesser extent misconstrued or disregarded. There is doubtless no such 
thing as a 'true space' , as once postulated by classical phi losophy -
and indeed sti l l postulated by that philosophy's continuation, namely 
epistemology and the 'scientific criteria' it promotes. But there is cer­
tain ly such a thing as a 'truth of space' wh ich embodies the movement 
of critical theory without being reducible to it . Human beings - why 
do we persist in saying 'man ' ?  - are in space ;  they cannot absent 
themselves from it, nor do they al low themselves to be excluded from 
it . 

Apart from what i t  ' re-marks' in relation to space, discourse is nothing 
more than a lethal void - mere verbiage. The analogy between the 
theory of space (and of its production) and the theory of language (and 
of its production) can only be carried so far. The theory of space 
describes and analyses textures. As we shal l see, the straight l ine , the 
curve (or curved l ine) , the check or draughtboard pattern and the 
radial-concentric ( centre versus periphery )  are forms and structures 
rather than textures. The production of space lays hold of such structures 
and integrates them into a great variety of wholes ( textures) .  A texture 
implies a meaning - but a meaning for whom? For some 'reader' ? No: 
rather, for someone who l ives and acts in the space under consideration, 
a 'subject' with a body - or, sometimes, a 'collective subject' . From the 
point of view of such a 'subject' the deployment of forms and structures 
corresponds to functions of the whole. Blanks ( i .e. the contrast between 
absence and presence) and margins, hence networks and webs, have a 
lived sense which has to be raised intact to the conceptual level . 

Let us now try to pursue this discussion to its logical conclusion. At 
present, in France and elsewhere, there are two phi losophies or theories 
of language. These two orientations transcend squabbles between di ffer­
ent schools of thought and, though they often overlap, they are basical ly 
distinct. 

1 According to the first view, no sign can exist in isolation. The l inks 
between signs and their articulation are of major importance, for i t is 
only through such concatenation that signs can have meaning, can 
signify . The sign thus becomes the focal point of a system of knowledge, 
and even of theoretical knowledge in general (semiology, semiotics ) .  



SOCIAL SPACE 133  

Language, the vehicle of understanding, gives rise to an understanding 
of itsel f  which is an absolute knowledge . The (unknown or misconstrued) 
'subject' of language can only atta in sel f-certitude to the extent that it 
becomes rhe subject of knowledge via an understanding of language as 
such. 

The methodical srudy of chains of signifiers is thus placed at the forefront 
of rhe search for knowledge (connaissance) . This search is assumed to 
begin with linguistic signs and then to extend to anything susceptible of 
carrying sign ificance or meaning: images, sounds, and so on. In this way 
an absolute Knowledge (Savoir) can construct a mental space for itself, the 
connections between signs, words, things and concepts not d iffering from 
each other in any fundamental manner . Linguistics wil l thus have estab­
l ished a realm of certainty which can gradually extend its sovereignty to 
a good many other areas. The science of language embodies the essence 
of knowledge, the principle of absolute knowledge, and determines the 
order in which knowledge is acquired. It provides our understanding with 
a stable basis to which a series of extensions may be added - epistemology, 
for example, which indeed deals with acquired knowledge and the lan­
guage of that knowledge ; or semiology, which concerns itse lf with 
systems of non-verbal s igns; and so on. Seen from this angle, everything 
- music, painting, archi tecture - is language. Space itse lf, reduced to 
signs and sets of signs, becomes part of knowledge so defined. As, l i tt le 
by l i ttle, do al l objects in that space. 

The theory of signs is connected to set theory, and hence to logic -
that is , to 'pure' relationships such as those of commutativity, transitivity 
and distributivity (and their logical opposites) .  Every mental and social 
relationship may thus be reduced to a formal relation of the type : A is 
to B as B is to C. Pure formal ism becomes an (a lbeit empty) hub for 
the tota l ization of knowledge, of d iscourse, of phi losophy and science, 
of percept ibi l ity and intell igibi l i ty, of time and space, of 'theoretical 
practice' and social practice. 

It is scarcely necessary to evoke the great success that this approach 
has enjoyed recently in France. (In the English-speaking countries it is 
general ly considered to be a substitute for logical empiricism. )  But what 
are the reasons for this success ? One is, certa inly, that such an orientation 
helps ensconce knowledge, and hence the university, in a central position 
whence, it is thought, they may dominate socia l space in its entirety. 
Another reason is that in the last analysis this view of things attempts 
to save a Cartesian, Western, and Europe-centred Logos which is 
compromised, shaken, and assailed on a l l  sides, from within as from 
without. The notion is, and everyone is surely famil iar with it by now, 



134 SOCIA L S PACE 
that linguistics, along with its auxi l iary disciplines, can be set up as a 
'science of sciences' capable of rect i fying the shortcomings, wherever 
they might occur, of other sciences such as polit ical economy, history 
or sociology. The irony is that l inguistics, in seeking to furnish knowl­
edge with a solid core, has succeeded only in establ ishing a void, a 
dogmatical l y posited vacuum which, when not surrounded by si lence, 
is buried in a mass of meta language, empty words and chit-chat about 
discourse. Caution - scientific caution - forbids any rash attempt to 
bridge the (epistemologica l )  chasm between known and not-known; the 
forbidden frui t of l ived experience flees or disappears under the assaults 
of reductionism ; and si lence reigns around the fortress of knowledge. 

2 'kh kann das Wort so hoch unmoglich schatzen ' :  'I cannot grant the 
word such sovereign merit . '  Thus Goethe's Faust, Part l . 23 And indeed 
it is impossible to put such a h igh value upon language, on speech, on 
words. The Word has never saved the w�r:ld and it never wi l l .  

For the second view of language al luded to above, an examination of 
signs reveals a terrible reality. Whether letters, words, images or sounds, 
signs are rigid, glacial ,  and abstract in a peculiarly menacing way. 
Furthermore, they are harbingers of death . A great portion of their 
importance lies in the fact that they demonstrate an intimate connection 
between words and death, between human consciousness and deadly 
acts : breaking, ki l l ing, suicide. In this perspective, all signs are bad signs, 
th reats - and weapons. This accounts for their cryptic nature, and 
explains why they are l iable to be hidden in the depths of grottoes or 
belong to sorcerers (Georges Batail le evokes Lascaux in this connection ) .  
Signs and figures of the invisible threaten the visible world. When 
associated with weapons, or found amidst weapons, they serve the 
purposes of the wil l to power. Written, they serve authority . What are 
they ? They are the doubles of things . When they assume the properties 
of things, when they pass for things, they have the power to move us 
emotionally, to cause frustrations, to engender neuroses. As repl icas 
capable of disassembling the 'beings' they replicate , they make possible 
the breaking and destruction of those beings, and hence also their 
reconstruction in different forms. The power of the sign is thus extended 
both by the power of knowledge over nature and by the sign's own 
hegemony over human beings ; this capacity of the sign for action 
embodies what Hegel called the 'terrible power of negativiry'. As com­
pared with what is signified, whether a thing or a 'being', whether actual

SOC I A L  SPACE 1 35  
or possible, a sign ha s  a repetitive aspect in that i t adds a corresponding 
representation. Between the signified and the sign there is a mesmerizing 
difference, a deceptive gap :  the shift from one to the other seems simple 
enough, and it is easy for someone who has the words to feel that they 
possess the th ings those words refer to. And, indeed, they do possess 
them up to a certa in point - a terrible point. As a vain yet also effective 
trace, the s ign has the power of destruction because it has the power of 
abstraction - and thus a lso the power to construct a new world di fferent 
from nature's init ial one. Herein l ies the secret of the Logos as foundation 
of al l power and al l authority; hence too the growth in Europe of 
knowledge and technology, industry and imperial ism. 

Space is also felt to have this deadly character: as the locus of 
communication by means of signs, as the locus of separations and the 
mi l ieu of prohibitions, spatia l i ty is characterized by a death instinct 
inherent to l i fe - which only prol iferates when it enters into conflict 
with itsel f and seeks i ts own destruction. 

Th is pessimistic view of signs has a long pedigree. I t i s to be found 
in Hegel 's notion of a negativity later compensated for by the positivity 
of knowledge.24 I t  occurs, in a more acute and emphatic form, in 
Nietzsche the phi lologist-poet and phi losopher (or metaphilosopher) . 25 
For Nietzsche, language has an anaphorical even more than a metaphor­
ical character. It always leads beyond presentness, towards an elsewhere, 
and above all towards a hypervisual ization which eventual ly destroys 
it. Prior to knowledge, and beyond it, are the body and the actions of 
the body: suffering, desire, pleasure. For Nietzsche the poet, poetry 
consists in a metamorphosis of signs. In the course of a struggle which 
overcomes the antagonism between work and play, the poet snatches 
words from the jaws of death. In the chain of signifiers, he substitutes 
l ife for death, and 'decodes ' on this basis . The struggle is as terrible as 
the trap-ridden and shifting terra in upon which it i s waged. Happily for 
the poet, he does not fight without succour: musicians, dancers, actors 
- all travel the same road; and, even if there is much anguish along the 
way, incomparable pleasures are the prize. 

It is facile in this context - and simply too convenient - to draw a 
distinction between a poetry which intensifies l i fe (Goethe's Faust, or 
Nietzsche's Zarathustra )  and a poetry of death (Ri lke, Mal larme) . 26

These two orientations in the theory (or phi losophy) of language have 
rarely been presented separately - in their 'pure' forms, so to speak. 
French authors have for the most part sought a compromise of some 
kind, though Georges Batail le and Anton in Artaud are notable excep­
tions. This widespread eclecticism has been faci l i tated by psychoanalysis . 
A transition from discourse-as-knowledge to a 'science of discourse' is 
made suspiciously pain lessly, as though there were no abyss between 
them. The science of discourse is next easily made to embrace the 
spoken, the unspoken and the forbidden, which are conceived of as the 
essence and meaning of l ived experience. By which point the science of 
discourse is wel l on the way to bringing social discourse as a whole 
under its aegis . The death instinct, proh ib i tions (especial ly that against 
incest ) , castration and the objectification of the phal l ic, writ ing as the 
projection of the voice - these are j ust so many way-stations along this 
expansionist route. Semiotics, we are told, is concerned with the instincts 
of l i fe and death , whereas the symbolic and semantic a reas are the 
province of signs properly speaking. 27 As for space, it is supposedly 
given along with and in language, and is not formed separately from 
language. Fi l led with signs and meanings, an indistinct intersection point 
of discourses, a container homologous with whatever it contains, space 
so conceived is comprised merely of functions, articulations and connec­
tions - in which respect it closely resembles discourse. Signs are a 
necessity, of course, but they are sufficient unto themselves, because the 
system of verbal signs (whence written language derives) a lready embod­
ies the essential l inks in the chain, spatial l inks included. Unfortunately, 
th is proposed compromise, which sacrifices space by handing it on a 
platter to the phi losophy of language, is quite unworkable. The fact is 
that signi fying processes (a signifying practice) occur in a space which 
cannot be reduced either to an everyday discourse or to a l i terary 
language of texts. I f  indeed signs as deadly instruments transcend them­
selves through poetry, as Nietzsche claimed and sought to show in 
practice, they must of necessity accomplish this perpetual self-transcend­
ence in space. There is no need to reconcile the two theses concerning 
signs by means of an eclecticism which is somehow respectful of both 

17 See Ju l ia  Kristeva's doctoral thesis, 'Langage, sens, poesie' ( 1 973) ,  which puts much 
emphasis on this distinction berween the semiotic realm ( involving instincts) and the 
symbolic one ( involving language as a system of communications) .  Indeed, Kristeva goes 
even fu rther in this di rection than Jacques Lacan in his  Ecrits (Paris: Seu i l ,  1 966) .  The 
author most adept at keeping both these bal ls in the a i r  is Roland Barthes, as witness his 
entire work. The problem is forceful ly posed br Hermann Hesse in his Glass Bead Game 
(see above, p. 24, note 30) ,  but Hesse offers no solution . 



SOCI A L  SPACE 1 37  

'pure' knowledge and ' impure' poetry. The task confronting u s  i s  not 
to speculate on an ambiguity but rather to demonstrate a contradiction 
in order to resolve it, or, better, in order to show that space resolves it. 
The deployment of the energy of living bodies in space is forever going 
beyond the l i fe and death instincts and harmonizing them. Pain and 
pleasure, which are poorly distinguished in nature, become clearly dis­
cernible in (and thanks to) socia l space. Products, and a fortiori works, 
are destined to be enjoyed (once labour, a mixture of painfu l  effort and 
the joy of creation, has been completed) .  Although spaces exist which 
give expression to insurmountable separations - tombs being a case in 
point - there are a lso spaces devoted to encounter and gratification. 
And, i f  poets struggle against the iciness of words and refuse to fa l l  into 
the traps set by signs, it is even more appropriate that arch i tects should 
conduct a comparable campaign, for they have at the ir disposal both 
materials analogous to signs (bricks, wood, steel , concrete) and materiel 
analogous to those 'operations' which l ink signs together, articulating 
them and conferring meaning upon them (arches, vaults, pi l lars and 
columns; openings and enclosures ; construction techniques; and the 
conjunction and dis junction of such elements ) .  Thus it is that arch itec­
tura l genius has been able to real ize spaces dedicated to voluptuousness 
( the Alhambra of Granada) , to contemplation and wisdom (cloisters ) ,  
to power ( castles and chiiteaux) or to heightened perception Uapanese 
gardens) . Such gen ius produces spaces fu l l  of meaning, spaces which 
first and foremost escape morta l i ty :  enduring, radiant, yet also inhabited 
by a speci fic local tempora lity. Arch itecture produces l iving bodies, each 
with its own distinctive traits. The animating principle of such a body, 
its presence, is neither visible nor legible as such, nor is i t the object of 
any discourse, for it reproduces itsel f within those who use the space in 
question, within their l ived experience. Of that experience the tourist, 
the passive spectator, can grasp but a pale shadow. 

Once brought back into conjunction with a (spatial and signifying) 
social practice, the concept of space can take on its fu l l  meaning. Space 
thus rejoins material production : the production of goods, things, objects 
of exchange - clothing, furnishings, houses or homes - a production 
which is d ictated by necessity . I t a lso rejoins the productive process 
considered at a h igher level , as the result of accumulated knowledge; at 
th is level labour is penetrated by a material ly creative experimental 
science. Lastly, i t  rejoins the freest creative process there is - the signify­
ing process, which contains within itself the seeds of the 'reign of 
freedom', and which is destined in principle to deploy its possibi l ities 
under that reign as soon as labour dictated by blind and immediate

necessity comes to an end - as soon, in other words, as the process of 
creating true works, meaning and pleasure begins. (It may be noted in 
passing that such creations are themselves very diverse : for example, 
contemplation may involve sensual pleasure, which, though i t  includes 
sexual gratification, is not l imited to i t . )  

Let us now consider a seminal text of Nietzsche's on language, written 
in 1 873 .  More of a phi lologist than a phi losopher, and a lover of 
language because he approached it as a poet, Nietzsche here brought 
forward two concepts which were then a lready classic, and wh ich have 
since been vulgarized : metaphor and metonymy. For the modern school 
of l inguistics, which takes its inspiration from Saussure, these two figures 
of speech go beyond primary language; in other words, they transcend 
the first level of discourse. Th is is consistent with the meaning of the 
Greek prefix meta- :  metaphor and metonymy are part of meta language 
- they belong to the second level of language. 

In Nietzschean thought (which appears very different today from the 
way it appeared at the turn of the century ) ,  meta- is understood in a 
very radical manner. Metaphor and metonymy make their appearance 
here at the simplest level of language: words as such are already meta­
phoric and metonymic for Nietzsche - Kofmann, who seems to think 
that these terms apply only to concepts, notwithstanding.28 Words 
themselves go beyond the immediate, beyond the perceptible - that is 
to say, beyond the chaos of sense impressions and stimul i .  When this 
chaos is replaced by an image, by an audible representation, by a word 
and then by a concept, i t undergoes a metamorphosis. The words of 
spoken language are simply metaphors for things. 29 The concept arises 
from an identification of things which are not identical - i.e. from 
metonymy. We take a language for an instrument of veracity and a 
structure of accumulated truths. In  real i ty, according to Nietzsche, it is 
'A mobi le army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms - in 
short , a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, 
and embell ished poetical ly and rhetorical ly , and which after long use 
seem firm, canonical ,  and obl igatory to a people' . 3 0  In more modern 
terms : language in action is more important than language in general 
or discourse in general ; and speech is more creative than language as a 
system - and a fortiori than writing or reading. Language in action and

t he  spoken word are inventive; they restore l i fe to  signs and concepts 
that are worn down l ike old coins. But j ust what is i t that 'figures of 
speech ', metaphors, metonyms and metamorphoses invent, cal l forth, 
translate or betray? Could it be that rea l i ty is grounded in the imagin­
ation ? That the world was created by a god who was a poet or a dancer? 
The answer - at least so far as the social rea lm is concerned - must be 
no. The fact is that a 'pyramidal order', and hence a world of castes 
and classes, of laws and privi leges, of h ierarchies and constra ints, stands 
opposed to the world of first impressions as 'that which is firmest, most 
general, best known, most human, and hence that which regulates and 
rules' .-� 1 A society is a space and an architecture of concepts, forms and 
laws whose abstract truth is imposed on the rea l i ty of the senses, of 
bodies, of wishes and desires. 

At several points in his phi losophical (or metaphi losoph ical ) and 
poetic work, Nietzsche stresses the visual aspect predominant in the 
metaphors and metonyms that constitute abstract thought : idea, vision, 
clarity, enl ightenment and obscurity, the vei l , perspective, the mind's 
eye, mental scrutiny, the 'sun of intel l igib i l ity', and so on. This is one 
of Nietzsche's great discoveries (to use another visual metaphor) . He 
points out how over the course of history the visual has increasingly 
taken precedence over elements of thought and action deriving from the 
other senses (the faculty of hearing and the act of l istening, for instance, 
or the hand and the voluntary acts of  'grasping', 'holding', and so on) . 
So far has this trend gone that the senses of smel l , taste, and touch have 
been a lmost completely annexed and absorbed by sight. The same 
goes for sexual i ty, and for desire (which survives in travestied form as 
Sehnsucht) . Here we see the emergence of the anaphorical aspect of 
language, which embraces both metaphor and metonymy. 

The fol lowing conclusions may thus be drawn. 

Metaphor and metonymy are not figures of speech - at least not at 
the outset. They become figures of speech . In principle, they are acts. 
What do such acts accomplish ? To be exact, they decode, bringing forth 
from the depths not what is there but what is sayable, what is susceptible 
of figuration - in short, language. Here is the source of the activities of 
speech, of language in action, of discourse, activities which might more 
properly be named 'metaphorization ' and 'metonymization' . What is the 
point of departure of these processes ? The body metamorphosed. Do 
representations of space and representational spaces, to the degree that

they make use of such 'figures ' , tend to 'natura l ize ' the spatial realm ? 
No - or not merely - because they also tend to make it evaporate, to 
dissolve it in a luminous (optical and geometrica l )  transparency . 
2 These procedures involve displacement, and hence also transposition 
and transfer. Beyond the body, beyond impressions and emotions, 
beyond l i fe and the rea lm of the senses, beyond pleasure and pain, l ies 
the sphere of distinct and articulated unit ies, of signs and words - in 
short, of abstractions. Metaphorization and metonymization are defining 
characteristics of signs. It is a 'beyond' , but a nearby one, which creates 
the il l usion of great remoteness. Although 'figures of speech ' express 
much, they lose and overlook, set aside and place parentheses around 
even more. 
3 It is perhaps legitimate to speak of a logic of the metaphorical and a 
logic of the metonymic, because these ' figures of speech' give bi rth to a 
form, that of coherent and articu late discourse, which is analogous to 
a logical form, and above all because they erect a mental and social 
archi tecture above spontaneous life . In discourse, as in the perception 
of society and space, there is a constant to-and-fro both between the 
component elements and between the parts and the whole. 
4 Th is immense movement has myriad connections : on the one hand 
with rational ity, with the Logos, with reasoning by analogy and by 
deduction; and on the other hand with socia l  structures which are bound 
up in their turn with pol itical structures - that is to say, with power. 
Hence the ever-growing hegemony of vision, of the visible and the legible 
(of the written, and of writing) . All these elements - these forms, 
functions and structures - have complex spatial i nterrelationships which 
can be analysed and explained. 

So, i f  there is fetishism (of a visual, intel l igible and abstract space ) ,  and 
i f  there is fascination (with a natural space which has been lost and/or 
rediscovered, with absolute politica l or religious spaces, or with spaces 
given over to voluptuousness or death ) ,  then theory is well able to trace 
their genesis, which is to say thei r production.

What is i t  that obscures the concept of production as it relates to space? 
Sufficient attention has a l ready been paid to the proponents of absol ute 
knowledge and to the new dogmatists, and there is no fu rther need here 



SOCIAL SPACE 1 4 1  
to examine their talk o f  a n  epistemological field o r  base, o f  the space 
of the episteme, and so forth. We saw earlier how they reduce the socia l 
to the mental and the practical to the intel lectual , at the same time 
underwriting the extension of the laws of private property to knowledge 
itself. I have not dealt, however, with the fact that a number of notions 
which tend to confuse the concept with which we are concerned derive 
from semiology, notably the thesis according to which social space is 
the result merely of a marking of natural space, a leaving of traces upon 
it . Though made use of by the semiologists, notions such as those 
of marks, marking and traces do not actual ly originate with them. 
Anthropologists, among others, used them earlier. The semiological use, 
however, p laces more emphasis on meaning: marks are supposed to 
signify, to be part of a system, and to be susceptible of coding and 
decoding. Space may be marked physical ly , as with animals ' use of smells 
or human gr-;ups' use of visual �� auditory ··lndicarors; a lternatively, it 
may be marked abstractly, by means of discourse, by means of signs. 
Space thus acquires symbolic value. Symbols, on this view, always imply 
an emotional investment, an affective charge (fear, attraction, etc. ) ,  
whichis so to speak deposited at a particular place and thereafter 
' reJiresented ' for the benefit of everyone elsewhere. In point Of--fact, 
early agricultural and pastoral societies knew no such split b_e1�een the 
practica l and the symbolic. Only very much later was this distinction 
detected by analytical th inking. To separate these two spheres is to 
render 'physica l '  symbols incomprehensible, and l ikewise practice, wh ich 
is thus portrayed as the practice of a society without the capacity for 
abstraction. It is reasonable to ask, however, whether one may properly 
speak of a production of space so long as marking and symbol ization 
of this kind are the only way of relating to space. And the answer to 
this question has to be: not as yet, even though l iving bodies, mobile 
and active, may a l ready be said to be extending both their spatial 
perception and their occupation of space, l ike a spider spinning its web .  
I f and to the extent that production occurs, it w i l l  be restricted for a 
long time to marks, signs and symbols, and these wil l not significantly 
affect the material rea l i ty upon which they are imprinted. For all that 
the earth may become Mother Earth, cradle of l i fe, a symbolical ly sexual 
ploughed field, or a tomb, it wi l l sti l l  be the earth. 

I t sho.uld bs note.d that the type of activity that consists in marking 
particular locations and indicating routes by means of markers or-blazes 
is characteristic only of the very earliest stages of organized-society. 
During these primitive phases, the itineraries of hunters and fishermen, 
along with those of flocks and herds, are marked out, and �Q_oi (soon 



1 42 SOCIAL S PA C E  
to become lieux-dits, or 'places ca lled' such and such) are indicated by 
stones or cairns wherever no natural landmarks such as trees or shrubs 
are to hand. These are times during which natural spaces are merely 
traversed. Social labour scarcely affects them at a l l .  Later on, marking 
and symbolization may become individualized or playful procedures, as 
for example when a child indicates her own corner because it amuses 
her to leave behind some trace of her presence. 

This mistaken notion of the semiologists has given rise to the diametri­
cal ly opposite but complementary idea that 'artificia l '  space is solely the 
resu l t of a denaturing or denatura l ization of some objective, authenti­
cally 'natural ' space. What forces are said to be respons ible for th i s ?  
The obvious ones: science and technology, and hence abstraction. The 
problem with this view is that i t studiously ignores the divers i ty of social 
spaces and of their h istorical origins, reducing all such spaces to the 
common trait of abstraction (which is of course inherent to al l conceiv­
able activi ty involving knowledge) .  

Semiology is a lso the source of the c la im that space is susceptible of 
a 'reading', and hence the legit imate object of a practice (reading/ 
writing ) .  The space of the city is said to embody a discourse, a lan­
guage.32 

Does i t  make sense to speak of a ' reading' of space ? Yes and no. Yes, 
inasmuch as it is possible to envisage a ' reader' who deciphers or decodes 
and a 'speaker' who expresses himself by translating his progression 
into a discourse. But no, in that socia l  space can in no way be compared 
to a blank page upon which a specific message has been inscribed (by 
whom ? ) .  Both natural and urban spaces are, i f anything, 'over-inscribed' :  
everything therein resembles a rough draft, jumbled and self-contradic­
tory . Rather than signs, what one encounters here are directions -
multifarious and overlapping instructions. If there is i ndeed text, inscrip­
tion or writing to be found here, it is in a context of conventions, 
intentions and order (in the sense of socia l order versus social disorder ) .  
That space signifies is incontestable. But what it signifies is dos and 
don'ts - and th i s brings us back to power. Power's message is invariably 
confused - del i berately so ; diss imulation is necessari ly pa rt of any 
message from power. Thus space indeed 'speaks' - but it does not tel l 
al l . Above al l , it prohibits. Its mode of existence, its practical 'reality' 
( including its form) differs radical ly from the real i ty (or being-there) of 
something written, such as a book. Space is at once result and cause, 
product and producer; i t is also a stake, the locus of projects and actions 

32 See Roland Barthes i n  A rchitect1<re d'a1<jo1<rd'h1<i, nos 132 and 1 5 3 .  



SOCIAL SPACE 143 

deployed as part of specific strategies, and hence also the object of 
wagers on the future - wagers which are articu lated, i f  never completely. 

As to whether there is a spatial code, there are actua l ly several . This 
has not daunted the semiologists, who blithely propose to determine the 
h ierarchy of levels of interpretation and then find a residue of elements 
capable of getting the decoding process going once more. Fair enough ,  
but this is to mistake restrictions for signs in general .  Activ i ty in space 
is restricted by that space; space 'decides' what activity may occur, but 
even this 'decis ion ' has l im its placed upon it. Space lays down the law 
because i t implies a certain order - and hence also a certain disorder 
( just as what may be seen defines what is obscene) . Interpretation comes 
later, almost as an afterthought. Space commands bodies, prescribing 
or proscribing gestures, routes and distances to be covered. It is produced 
with this purpose in mind; this is its raison d'etre. The ' reading' of space 
is thus merely a secondary and practica l ly i rrelevant upshot, a rather 
superfluous reward to the individual for blind, spontaneous and lived 
obedience. 

So, even if the reading of space (a lways assuming there is such a 
thing) comes first from the standpoint of knowledge, it certainly comes 
last in the genesis of space itself. No ' reading of the space' of Roman­
esque churches and their surroundings ( towns or monasteries ) ,  for exam­
ple, can i n  any way help us predict the space of so-ca lled Gothic churches 
or understand their preconditions and prerequis ites: the growth of the 
towns, the revolution of the communes, the activ ity of the gui lds, and 
so on. Th is space was produced before being read; nor was it produced 
in order to be read and grasped, but rather in order to be lived by 
people with bodies and l ives in their own particu la r urban context. In 
short, ' reading' fol lows production in al l cases except those in which 
space is produced especial ly in order to be read. Th is raises the question 
of what the virtue of readabi l ity actual ly is. I t  turns out on close 
examination that spaces made (produced) to be read are the most 
deceptive and tricked-up imaginable . The graphic impression of read­
abi l i ty is a sort of trompe-l 'oeil conceal ing strategic intentions and 
actions. Monumentality, for instance, always embodies and imposes a 
clearly intell igible message. It says what it wishes to say - yet it h ides 
a good deal more: being poli tica l , mi l i tary, and ult imately fascist in 
character, monumental bui ld ings mask the will to power and the arbi­
trariness of power beneath signs and surfaces which claim to express 
col lective wi l l  and collective thought. In the process, such signs and 
surfaces also manage to conjure away both possibi l i ty and time. 

We have known since Vitruvius - and in modern times since Labrouste

(d. 1 8 75 ) ,  who was forever harping on it - that in arch itecture form 
must express function. Over the centuries the idea conta ined in the term 
'express' here has grown narrower and more precise. Most recently, 
'expressive' has come to mean merely ' readable' .33 The archi tect is 
supposed to construct a signifying space wherein form is to function as 
signifier is to signified; the form, in other words, is supposed to enunciate 
or procla im the function. According to this principle, which is espoused 
by most 'designers' , the environment can be furnished with or animated 
by signs in such a way as to appropriate space, in such a way that space 
becomes readable ( i .e .  'plausibly' l inked) to society as a whole. The 
inherence of function to form, or in other words the appl ication of the 
criterion of readabi l i ty , makes for an instantaneousness of reading, act 
and gesture - hence the tedium which accompanies this quest for a 
formal-functional transparency. We are deprived of both internal and 
external distance : there is nothing to code and decode in an 'environment 
without environs' . What is more, the significant contrasts in a code of 
space designed specifical ly to signify and to ' be' readable are extremely 
commonplace and simple. They boil down to the contrast between 
horizontal and vertical l ines - a contrast which among other things 
masks the vertica l ' s impl ication of hauteur. Versions of this contrast are 
offered in visual terms which are supposed to express i t with great 
intensity but which, to any detached observer, any ideal 'walker in the 
city', have no more than the appearance of intensity. Once again, the 
impression of intel l igibi l ity conceals far more than i t reveals . It conceals, 
precisely, what the visible/readable ' is ' , and what traps it holds; i t 
conceals what the vertical ' is ' - namely, arrogance, the wi l l  to power, 
a display of mil i tary and police-like machismo, a reference to the phal lus 
and a spatial analogue of mascu line brutality. Nothing can be taken for 
granted in space, because what are involved are real or possible acts, 
and not mental states or more or less well-told stories. In produced 
space, acts reproduce 'meanings' even if no 'one' gives an account of 
them. Repressive space wreaks repression and terror even though it 
may be strewn with ostensible signs of the contrary (of contentment, 
amusement or delight ) .  

This tendency has gone so far that some architects have even begun 
to cal l either for a retu rn to ambiguity, in the sense of a confused and 
not immediately interpretable message, or else for a diversification of

space which would be consistent with a l iberal and plura l istic society .34 
Robert Venturi, as an archi tect and a theorist of architecture, wants to 
make space dialectica l .  He sees space not as an empty and neutral milieu 
occupied by dead objects but rather as a field of force ful l  of tensions 
and distortions. Whether this approach can find a way out of func­
tional ism and formalism that goes beyond merely formal adj ustments 
remains (in 1972) to be seen. Painting on buildings certainly seems l ike 
a rather feeble way of retrieving the richness of 'classica l '  architecture. 
ls it rea l ly possible to use mural surfaces to depict social contradictions 
while producing something more than graffiti ? That would indeed be 
somewhat paradoxical i f, as I have been suggesting, the notions of 
'design ' ,  of reading/writing as practice, and of the 'sign ifier-signified' 
rel ationship projected onto things in che shape of the 'form-function' 
one are all directed, whether consciously or no, towards the dissolving 
of conflicts into a general transparency, into a one-dimensional present 
- and onto an as i t were 'pure' surface. 

I daresay many people wi l l respond to such th inking somewhat as 
follows. 

Your arguments are tendentious. You want to re-emphasize the 
signified as opposed to the sign ifier, the content as opposed to the 
form. But true innovators operate on forms; they invent new forms 
by working in the realm of signifiers. I f  they are writers, this is 
how they produce a discourse. The same goes for other types of 
creation. But as for architects who concern themselves primarily 
with content, as for 'users', as for the activity of dwel l ing itself -
al l these merely reproduce outdated forms. They are in no sense 
innovative forces. 

To which my reply might be something like this : 

I have no quarrel with the proposition chat work on signifiers and 
the production of a language are creative activ ities ; that is an 
incontestable fact. But I question whether this is the whole story 
- whether this proposition covers al l circumstances and all fields. 
Surely there comes a moment when formalism is exhausted, when 
only a new injection of content into form can destroy i t and so 
open up the way to innovation. The harmonises invented a great

musical form, for instance, yet the formal discoveries about har­
mony made by the natural phi losophers and by theorists of music 
such as Rameau did not take the exploration and exploitation of 
the possibi l i ties that far. Such progress occurred only with the 
advent of a Mozart or a Beethoven. As for architecture, the builders 
of palaces worked with and on signifiers ( those of power) . They 
kept within the boundaries of a certain monumental ity and made 
no attempt to cross them. They worked, moreover, not upon texts 
but upon (spatia l ) textures. Invention of a formal kind could not 
occur without a change in practice, without, in other words, a 
dialectical interaction between signi fying and signified elements, as 
some signifiers reached the exhaustion point of their formalism, 
and some signified elements, with their own peculiar violence, 
infi l tra ted the realm of sign ifiers. The combinatorial system of the 
elements of a set - for our purposes a set of signs, and hence of 
signifiers - has a shorter l ife than the individual combinations that 
it embraces. For one thing, any such combinatorial system of signs 
loses its interest and emotional force as soon as it is known and 
recognized for what it is ; a kind of saturation sets in, and even 
changing the combinations that are included or excluded from the 
system cannot remedy matters. Secondly, work on signifiers and 
the production of a discourse facil itate the transmission of messages 
only i f the labour involved is not patent. I f  the 'object' bears traces 
of that labour, the reader's attention will be diverted to the writing 
itse lf and to the one who does the writing. The reader thus comes 
to share in the fatigue of the producer, and is soon put off. 

It is very important from the outset to stress the destructive (because 
reductive) effects of the predominance of the readable and visible, of 
the absolute priority accorded to the visual realm, which in turn implies 
the priority of reading and writing. An emphasis on visual space has 
accompanied the search for an impression of weightlessness in architec­
ture. Some theorists of a supposed architectural revolution claim Le 
Corbusier as a pioneer in this connection, but in fact it was Brunelleschi , 
and more recently Baltard and then Eiffel ,  who blazed the tra i l .  Once 
the effect of weightiness or massiveness upon which arch itects once 
depended has been abandoned, it becomes possible to break up and 
reassemble volumes arbitrari ly according to the dictates of an architec­
tural neoplasticism . Moderni ty expressly reduces so-ca l led ' iconological '  
forms of expression (signs and symbols) to su rface effects. Volumes or 
masses are deprived of any physical consistency. The architect considers

h imself responsible for laying down the social function (or use) of 
bui ldings, offices, or dwel l i ngs, yet interior walls which no longer have 
any spatial or bearing role, and interiors in  general ,  are simultaneously 
losing all character or content. Even exterior walls no longer have any 
material substance : they have become mere membranes barely managing 
to concretize the division between i nside and outside. This does not 
prevent 'users' from projecting the relationship between the internal or 
private and a threatening outside world into an invented absolute rea lm; 
when there is no a l ternative, they use the signs of th i s antagonism, 
relying especial ly on those which indicate property. For an architectural 
thought in thral l to the model of transparency, however, a l l  partitions 
between inside and outside have col lapsed. Space has been comminuted 
into ' iconologica l '  figures and values, each such fragment being invested 
with i ndividual ity or worth simply by means of a particular colour or a 
particu lar material (brick, marble, etc. ) .  Thus the sense of circumscribed 
spaces has gone the same way as the impression of mass. Within and 
without have melted into transparency, becoming indistinguishable or 
interchangeable. What makes this tendency even more paradoxical i s 
the fact that i t proceeds under the banner of structures, of significant 
distinctions, and of the inside-outside and signifier-signified relation­
ships themselves. 

We have seen that the visual space of transparency and readabi l ity 
has a content - a content that it is designed to concea l :  namely, the 
phall ic rea lm of (supposed) viri l i ty. It is at the same time a repressive 
space : nothing in i t escapes the survei l lance of power. Everyth ing 
opaque, a l l  kinds of partitions, even walls simplified to the point of 
mere drapery, are destined to disappear. Th is disposition of things is 
diametrica l ly opposed to the rea l requirements of the present situation. 
The sphere of private l i fe ought to be enclosed, and have a finite, or 
finished, aspect. Public space, by contrast, ought to be an opening 
outwards. What we see happening is just the opposite. 

XIII 

Like any rea l ity, social space is related methodological ly and theoreti­
cal ly to three general concepts: form, structure, function . In other words, 
any socia l space may be subjected to formal, structural or functional 
ana·lysis. -Each of these approaches provides a code and a method for 
deciphering whifr at first may seem impenetrable.

These terms may seem clear enough, but in fact, since they cannot 
avoid polysemy, they all carry burdens of ambiguity. 

The ternt1orm' ,may be taken in a number of senses : aesthetic, plastic, 
abstract ( logico-mathematical ) ,  and so on. In a general sense, it evokes 
the description of contours and the demarcat;on of boundaries, extem'?ll 
l imits, area� anc!. volumes. Spatia l analysis accepts th is general use of 
the term, although dg_i_11g so d.oes not el iminate al l problems. A formal 
description, for example, may . aspi-�e to exactitude but stil l turn out to 
be shot through with ideological elements, especial ly when implicit or 
explicit reductionistic goals are involved. The presence of such goals is 
indeed a defining characteristic of formalism. Any space may be reduced 
to i ts formal elements : to curved and straight l ines or to such relations 
as internal-versus-external or volume-versus-area .  Such formal aspects 
have given rise in architecture, painting and sculpture to genuine systems: 
the system of the golden number, for example, or that of the Doric, Ionic 
and Corinthian orders, or that of modul i ( rhythms and proportions ) .  

Consideration of aesthetic effects or 'effects of meaning' has no par­
ticu lar righ t  of precedence in this context. What counts from the metho­
dological and theoretical standpoint is the idea that none of these three 
terms can exist in isolation from the other two. Forms, functions and 
structures are general ly given in and through a material rea lm which at 
once binds them together and preserves distinctions between them. When 
we consider an organism, for example, we can fa irly easily discern the 
forms, functions and structures within this tota lity. Once this threefold 
analysis has been completed, however, a residue invariably remains 
which seems to call for deeper analysis. Th is is the raison d'etre of the 
ancient phi losophical categories of being, nature, substance and matter. 
In the case of a produced 'object', this constitutive relationship is differ­
ent: the application to materials of a practical action ( technology, labour) 
tends to blur, as a way of mastering them, the distinctions between 
form, function and structure, so that the three may even come to imply 
one another in an immediate manner. This tendency exists only impl icitly 
in works of art and objects antedating the Industrial Revolution, includ­
ing furniture, houses, palaces and monuments; under the conditions of 
modernity, on the other hand, i t  comes close to its limit. With the advent 
of 'design ' ,  materia l ity tends to give way to transparency - to perfect 
'readabil ity' . Form is now merely the sign of function, and the relation 
between the two, which could not be clearer - that is, easier to produce 
and reproduce - is what gives rise to structure. A case where this 
account does not apply is that not uncommon one where 'designer' and 
manufacturer find it amusing to confuse the issue, as it were, and give 



SOCIAL SPACE 149 

a form (often a 'classica l '  one ) to a function completely unconnected 
with i t :  they disguise a bed as a cupboard, for example, or a refrigerator 
as bookshelves. The celebrated sign ifier-signified dichotomy is s ingularly 
appropriate when applied to such objects, but this specia l appl ication 
is just that - and a good deal more l imited than semantico-semiological 
orthodoxy would probably care to admit. As for social 'realities', here 
the opposite situation obtains : the distances between forms, functions 
and structu res lengthen rather than diminish . The three tend to become 
completely detached from one another. Their relationship is obscured 
and they become indecipherable (or undecodable) as the 'hidden' takes 
over from the 'readable' in favour of the predominance of the latter in 
the rea lm of objects. Thus a particu lar institution may have a variety 
of functions which are different - and sometimes opposed - to its 
apparent forms and avowed structures. One merely has to think of the 
institutions of ' justice ' , of the mi l itary, or of the police. In other words, 
the space of objects and the space of institutions are radica l ly divergent 
in 'modern' society. This is a society in which, to take an extreme 
example, the bu reaucracy is supposed to be, aspires to be, loudly pro­
claims itself to be, and perhaps even bel ieves itse lf to be ' readable' 
and transparent, whereas in fact it is the very epitome of opacity, 
indecipherabi l i ty and 'unreadabi l i ty' . The same goes for a l l  other state 
and political appa ratuses. 

The rel ationship between these key terms and concepts ( form, func­
tion, structure) becomes much more complex when one considers only 
those very abstract forms, such as the logical form, which do not depend 
on description and which are inseparable from a content. Among these, 
in addition to the logical form, must be numbered identity, reciprocity, 
recurrence, repetition ( i teration) ,  and di fference. Marx, fol lowing Adam 
Smith and Ricardo, showed how and why the form of exchange has 
achieved predominance in socia l practice in association with specific 
functions and structures. The form of soci al space - i .e . the 
centre-periphery relationship - has only recently come to occupy a place 
in our thinking about forms. As for the urban form - i .e . assembly, 
encounter and simultaneity - it has been shown to belong among 
the classic forms, in company with centra l i ty, difference, recu rrence, 
reciprocity, and so on. 

These forms, which are almost 'pure' (a t the extreme l imit of 'pu rity' 
the form disappears, as in the case of pure identity : A's identity with 
A) cannot be detached from a content. The interaction between form 
and content and the invariably concrete relationship between them a re 
the object of analyses about which we may repeat what we said earl ier : 



1 50 SOCIAL S PAC E 
each analytic stage deals with a residue left over from the previous stage, 
for an irreducible element - the substrate or foundation of the object's 
'presence' - a lways subsists . 

Between forms close to the point of purity at which they would 
disappear and their  contents there exist mediations. In the case of spatial 
forms, for example, the form of the curve is mediated by the curved 
l ine, and the straight form by the straight l ine .  All spatial arrangements 
use curved and/or straight forms; natura l ly, one or the other may 
predominate. 

When formal elements become part of a texture, they diversify, introd­
ucing both repetition and d i fference . They articulate the whole, faci l i tat­
ing both movement from the parts to the whole and, conversely, the 
mustering by the whole of i ts component elements. For example, the 
capitals of  a Romanesque cloister differ, but they do so within the l imits 
permitted by a model. They break space up and give i t  rhythm. This 
i l lustrates the function of what has been called the 'signifying differen­
tial' . 35 The semicircular  or ogival arch, with its supporting pi l lars and 
columns, has a d ifferent spatial meaning and value according to whether 
it occurs in  Byzantine or in Orienta l ,  in Gothic or in Renaissance 
arch i tecture .  Arches have both repeti tive and di fferentia l  functions 
with in  a whole whose ' style' they help determine. The same sort of thing 
goes i n  music for the theme and its treatment in fugal composition. Such 
'diaeretic' effects, which the semiologists compare to metonymy, are to 
be met with in a l l  treatments of space and time. 

The peopling and investment (or occupation) of a space a lways hap­
pens in  accordance with d iscernible and analysable forms : as dispersal 
or concentration, or as a function of a specific (or for that matter a 
nebulous) orientation . By contrast, assembly and concentration as spatial 
forms are a lways actual ized by means of geometric forms: a town may 
have a circular (radial-concentric) or a quadrangular form. 

The content of these forms metamorphoses them. The quadrangular 
form, for example, occurs in the ancient Roman mi l i tary camp, in 
medieval bastides, in  the Spanish colonial town and in the modern 
American city. The fact is, however, that these urban real i ties differ so 
radica l ly that  the abstract form in question is thei r only common feature. 

The Spanish-American colonial town is of considerable interest in  this 
regard. The foundation of these towns in  a colonial  empire went hand 
in hand with the production of  a vast space, namely that of Latin

America. Their urban space, which was instrumental i n  this larger 
production process, has continued to be produced despite the vicissitudes 
of imperia l ism, independence and industria l ization. It is an urban space 
especia l ly appropriate for study in that the colonial towns of Latin 
America were founded at the time of the Renaissance in Europe - that 
is to say, a t  a time when the study of the ancient world, and of the 
h istory, constitution, arch itecture and planning of its cities, was being 
resumed. 

The Spanish-American town was typ ica l ly bui l t  according to a plan 
la id down on the basis of standing orders, according to the veritable code 
of urban space constituted by the Orders for Discovery and Settlement, a 
collection, published in 1 573, of official instructions issued to founders 
of towns from 1 5 1 3  on. These instructions were arranged under the 
three heads of discovery, settlement and pacification. The very bui lding 
of the towns thus embodied a p lan which would determine the mode 
of occupation of the terri tory and define how it was to be reorganized 
under the administrative and polit ical authority of urban power. The 
orders st ipulate exactly how the chosen sites ought to be developed. 
The result is a strictly hierarchical organization of space, a gradual  
progression outwards from the town's centre, beginning with the ciudad 
and reaching out to the surrounding pueblos. The plan is fol lowed with 
geometrical precision : from the inevitable Plaza Mayor a grid extends 
indefin i tely in every d irection .  Each square or rectangular lot has its 
function assigned to it, while inversely each function is assigned its own 
place at a greater or lesser distance from the centra l square :  church, 
administrative bui ldings, town gates, squares, streets, port i nsta l lations, 
warehouses, town hall, and so on. Thus a h igh degree of segregation 
is superimposed upon a homogeneous space .36 Some historians have 
described this colonial town as an artificial product, but they forget that 
this artificial product is also an instrument of production : a superstruc­
ture foreign to the original  space serves as a polit ical means of introduc­
ing a social and economic structure in such a way that i t  may gain a 
foothold and indeed establish i ts 'base' in a particu lar locality. With i n  
this spatial framework, Spanish colonial archi tecture freely ( so  to  speak) 
deployed the Baroque motifs which are especial ly evident in the decor­
ation of fa<;ades. The relation between the 'micro' (architectu ral )  plane 
and the 'macro' (spatial-strategic) one does exist here, but i t  cannot be 
reduced to a logical rela t ionship or put into terms of  formal impl ication. 
The main point to be noted, therefore, is the production of a socia l  

'" See Emma Scovazzi in £spaces et socitite, no. 3 .  



152 SOCIAL SPACE 

space by political power - that is, by violence in the serv ice of economic 
goals. A socia l  space of this kind is generated out of a rational ized and 
theorized form serving as an instrument for the violation of an existing 
space. 

One is tempted to ask whether the various urban spaces with a grid 
pattern might not h ave comparable origins in  constraints imposed by a 
central power. It turns out upon reflection, however, that there is no 
rea l  justification for general izing from the particular development of 
urban space in  Latin America. Consider, for example, that transform­
ation of space in New York City which began a round 1 8 10 .  Obviously 
it is to be explained in part by the existence and the influence of an 
a l ready powerfu l  urban nucleus, and by the actions of a duly empowered 
authority .  On the other hand, developments in New York had absolutely 
nothing to do with the extraction of wealth by a metropolitan power, 
the colonial relationsh ip with Britain having come to an  end. Geometri­
cal urban space in Latin America was intimately bound up with a 
process of extortion and plunder serving the accumulation of wealth in 
Western Europe ; it is a lmost as though the riches produced were riddled 
out through the gaps in the grid. In English-speaking North America, 
by contrast, a formal ly homologous meshwork served only the pro­
duction and accumulation of capital on the spot. Thus the same abstract 
form may have opposing functions and give rise to diverse structures. 
This is not to say that the form is indifferent to function and structure: 
in both these cases the pre-existing space was destroyed from top to 
bottom; in both the aim was homogeneity ; and in both that aim was 
achieved. 

What of  the equally cross-ruled space of the Asian town and country­
side ? Here, apropos, is a resume of the remarks of a Japanese phi losopher 
of Buddhist background who was asked about the relationships between 
space, language and ideograms. 

You wil l  no doubt take a long time to understand the Chinese 
characters and the th inking beh ind these forms, which are not 
signs. You should know that for us perceptibil ity and intel l igibi l ity 
are not clearly distinct; the same goes for the signifier and what 
it signifies. It is hard for us to separate image and concept. So the 
meaning of an ideogram does not exist independently of  its graphic 
representation. To put i t  in terms of your distinctions, sensation 
and intellect are merged for us into a single level of apprehension. 
Consider one of the simplest characters: a square and two strokes 
joining its centre to the middle points of each of  its sides. I read 



SOCIAL SPACE 153  

this character, and  I pronounce i t  ta. What you see, no  doubt, i s  
a dry geometrica l figure. I f  I were to  try and  translate for you 
what I see and understand simu ltaneously when I look at this 
character, I would begin by saying that i t  was a bird's-eye view of 
a r ice field. The boundary l ines between rice fields are not stone 
wal ls or ba rbed-wire fences, but rather dykes which are an integral 
part of the fields themselves. When I contemplate this character, 
this rice field, I become the bird looking down from the optimum 
vantage point vertically above the centre of the fie ld .  What I 
perceive, however, is more than a rice field :  it is a lso the order of  
the universe, the organizing-principle of space. This principle 
appl ies as well to the city as to the countryside. In fact everything 
in the un iverse i s  divided into squares. Each square has five parts. 
The centre designates He who th inks and sustains the order of the 
universe - formerly, the Emperor. An imaginary perpendicular l ine 
ri ses from the centre of the square. This is the ideal l ine going up 
to the bird overhead, to the perceiver of space. It is thus the 
d imension of  thought, of knowledge, identified here with Wisdom 
and hence with the Power of  the wise man to conceive and conserve 
the order of nature. 

The Japanese notion of shin-gyo-sho elaborates further on this 
view of things. A basic principle rather than  simply a procedure 
for ordering spatial and temporal elements, it governs the precincts 
of temples and palaces as well as the space of towns and houses; 
it informs the composition of spatial ensembles accommodating 
the broadest possible range of activity, from family l i fe to major 
religious and polit ical events. Under its aegis, publ ic areas (the 
spaces of social relationships and actions) are connected up with 
private areas (spaces for contemplation, isolation and retreat) v ia 
'mixed' areas { l inking thoroughfares, etc. ) .  The term shin-gyo-sho 
thus embraces three levels of spatial and temporal ,  mental and 
socia l  organization, levels bound together by relationships of 
reciprocal impl ication. These relationships are not merely logical 
ones, though the logical relationship of implication certain ly under­
l ies them. The 'public' realm,  the rea lm of temple or palace, has 
private and 'mixed' aspects, whi le  the 'private' house or dwell ing 
has publ ic (e.g. reception rooms) and 'mixed' ones. Much the same 
may be said of the town as a whole. 

We thus have a global perception of space rather than represen­
tations of isolated spots. Meeting-places, intersections in the chequ­
erwork pattern, crossroads - these are more important to us than 



154  SOCIAL SPACE 

other p laces. Whence a number of social phenomena wh ich may 
seem strange to your anthropologists, such as Edward T. Hall i n  
h i s  Hidden Dimension,37 but  which seem perfectly normal to  us. 
It is indeed true, for example, that before the Americans came to 
Japan crossroads had names but the roads themselves did not, and 
that our houses bear numbers based on their age, not on their 
positions in the street. We have never had fixed routes for getting 
from one place to another, as you do, but that does not mean that 
we do not know where we are coming from or going to . We do 
not separate the ordering of space from its form, its genesis from 
its actual i ty, the abstract from the concrete, or nature from society .  
There is no house in Japan without a garden, no matter how tiny, 
as a place for contemplation and for contact with nature; even a 
handful of pebbles is nature for us - not just a detached symbol 
of it . We do not th ink right away of the distances that separate 
objects from one another. For space is never empty : it always 
embodies a meaning. The perception of gaps itse lf brings the whole 
body into play. Every group of places and objects has a centre, 
and this is  therefore true of the house, the city or the whole world .  
The centre may be perceived from every side, and reached from 
every angle of approach ; thus to occupy any vantage point is to 
perceive and discover everything that occurs. The centre so con­
ceived . can never become neutral or empty. I t  cannot be the 'locus 
of  an absence', because i t  is occupied by Divinity, Wisdom and 
Power, which by manifesting themselves show any impression of 
void to be i l lusory. The accentuation of  and in fusion of metaphys­
ical value into centres does not imply a corresponding devaluation 
of what surrounds those centres. Nature and divinity in the first 
place, then socia l  l i fe and relationships, and final ly individual and 
private l i fe - a l l  these aspects of human real i ty have their assigned 
places, all impl icatively l inked in a concrete fashion. Nor is thi s  
assertion a ffected by the fact that the emphasis may sh i ft upwards 
in  order to express the transcendence of  divinity, wisdom or power, 
whereas private l i fe with its attendant gestures remains on a 'hori­
zonta l '  p lane, pitching its tent, so to speak, at ground level . A 
single order embraces a l l .  Thus urban space is comprised, first, of  
wide avenues leading to the temples and palaces, secondly of 
medium-sized squares and streets which are the transitional and

connecting spaces, and ,  thirdly and lastly, of the  charming flower­
fi l led a lleys that afford access to our houses. 

The important thing here i s  not to reconstruct a view which, though 
different from the Western one, is no less viable and up-to-date (and 
hence only indirect ly the concern of anthropology in the broad sense, 
and even more distant ly of ethnology ) ,  but rather to understand the grid 
that underlies it . Interestingly, th is rel igious or political space has 
retained its relevance for thousands of years because i t  was rational  
from the outset. If we let  the letter G ( for 'global ' )  represent the level 
of the system which has the broadest extension - namely the 'publ ic' 
level of temples, palaces and polit ical and administrative bui ldings ; i f  
we let  P represent  the level of  residence and the places set  aside for i t  
- houses, apartments, and so on ;  and if M is a l lowed to stand for 
intermediate spaces - for arteries, transitional areas, and places of 
business - then we arrive at the following scheme. 

In general descriptive terms, the 'private' realm P subsumes (though 
they are clearly distinct) entrances, thresholds, reception areas and family 
l iving-spaces, along with places set aside for retreat and sleep. Each 
individual dwell ing l ikewise has an entrance, a focus, a place of retreat 
and so on. The level M takes in  avenues and squares, medium-sized 
thoroughfares and the passageways leading to the houses. As for level 
G, it may be subdivided into interior spaces open to the publ ic and the 
closed headquarters of i nstitutions, into accessible it ineraries and places 
reserved for notables, priests, princes and leaders. S imi lar considerations 
apply for each element of the system. Each location, at each level, has 



156  SOCIAL SPACE 

its characteristic traits: open or closed, low or high, symmetrical or 
asymmetrica l .  

Let us return now to the  Japanese phi losopher's remarks, the con­
clusion of which is something of a d iatribe, someth ing of an indictment 
of  Western civ i l ization : 

Your streets, squares and boulevards have ridiculous names which 
have nothing to do with them, nor with the people and things 
around them - lots of names of generals and battles. Your cities 
have smashed any reasonable conception of space to pieces . The 
grid on which they a re based, and the way you have elaborated 
upon it, are the best that the West can manage in this area, but i t  
is a poor best. I t  is based merely on a set of transformations - on 
a structure. I t  took one of your greatest researchers to discover 
the fact that complex spaces in  the form of tre l l i ses or semi-trell i ses 
are superior in practice to simplified spaces planned out in a 
branched or recti l inear manner. Our system, which I have been 
describing to you, shows why this is true : i t  has a concrete logic, 
a logic of the senses. Why don't you take it as a gift from us ? 
Work on the hypothesis of a discourse at once theoretical and 
practical, a discourse of the everyday which also transcends every­
day l i fe, a d iscourse both mental and socia l ,  architectural and 
urbanistic. Something l ike the discourse of your forebears - and I 
am talking about the ancient Greeks, not the Gauls. Such a dis­
course does not signify the city : i t  i s  the urban discourse i tsel f. 
True, it partakes of the absolute. But why shouldn't i t ?  It is a 
l iv ing discourse - unlike your lethal use of signs. You say you can 
'decode' your system. Wel l ,  we do better than that :  we create ours. 

Here is the 'pro-Western ' rejoinder: 

Not so fast, my friend. You say that the East has possessed a secret 
from time immemorial that the West has either lost or never had 
- namely, the key to the relationship between what people l iving 
in society do and what they say. In other words, the East is 
supposedly well acquainted with a vita l  connection which brings 
the rel igious, political and social rea lms into harmony with one 
another, whereas the West has destroyed al l  prospect of such 
harmony through its use of signs and i ts analytica l proclivities. 
And you propose that your experience and thinking be made the 



SOCIAL SPACE 1 57 

basis for the definition of a scheme closely akin to  what Erwin 
Panofsky ca l ls ,  apropos of the Middle Ages, a modus operandi -
a scheme responsible at once for a specific way of l i fe, a specific 
space, specific monuments, specific ideas - in short, for a specific 
civil ization. You suggest that  there is an underlying grid, or deep 
structure, which explains the natu re of places, the ways in which 
they are put to use, the routes fol lowed by their occupants, and 
even the everyday gestures of those occupants. Permit me to point 
out j ust how complicated such a scheme becomes as soon as one 
tries to reconstruct it. Take a space Cg, closed, elevated and 
symmetrica l .  It has to be distingu ished from a space Gm, open, 
elevated and symmetrical , as also from a space Gp, closed, located 
at a lower level and asymmetrical - and so on and so forth .  The 
combinatory system involved is vast - and hard to work with even 
with the help of a computer. Furthermore, can you be sure that  it 
accounts adequately for actual real i ty? Is it true, or sufficient, to 
say that a temple in  Kyoto has a public part, a part set aside for 
rites, and a part reserved for priests and meditators ? I grant that 
your scheme explains someth ing very important :  di fference within 
a framework of repetition. Considered in its various contexts, for 
example, the Japanese garden remains the same yet is never the 
same: i t  may be an imperial park, an  inaccessible holy p lace, the 
accessible annex of a sanctuary ,  a site of publ ic festivity, a place 
of 'private '  solitude and contemplation, or merely a way from one 
place to another. This remarkable institution of the garden is 
always a microcosm, a symbolic work of art ,  an object as well as 
a p lace, and it has diverse ' functions' which are never merely 
functions. It effectively el iminates from your space that antagonism 
between 'nature' and 'culture' which takes such a devastating toll 
in  the West: the garden exemplifies the appropriation of nature, 
for i t  is at  once enti rely natural - and thus a symbol of the 
macrocosm - and entirely cultural - and thus the projection of a 
way of l i fe. Wel l  and good .  But let's not go overboard with 
analogies. You say you are the possessors of a rationality. What 
exactly is  that rational i ty ? Does i t  include conceiving of space as 
a discourse, with rooms, houses (not forgetting gardens), streets, 
and so on functioning as that discourse 's component and signifying 
elements ? Your space, which is indeed both abstract and concrete, 
has one drawback : it belongs to Power. I t  impl ies (and is implied 
by) Divinity and Empire - knowledge and power combined and 
conflated. Is that what you would have the West adopt? Wel l ,  we 



1 5 8  SOCIAL SPACE 

find it hard to accept the idea that space and time should be 
produced by political power. Such ultra-Hegel ianism {to use our 
terminology) is very fine, but it is unacceptable to us. The state is 
not (or is  no longer) and can never for us be Wisdom united with 
Power. There is  every reason to fear that your scheme could 
become a terrible weapon of oppression.  You want to formal ize 
this scheme scientifical ly in the Western manner. Westerners, on 
the other hand, might be more inclined to see it as an authoritarian 
definition of the space-time totality.

Formal  and functional analyses do not el iminate the need to consider 
scale, proportion, dimension and leve l .  That is the task of structural 
analysis, which is concerned with the relations between the whole and 
the parts, between 'micro' and 'macro' levels .  Methodologically and 
theoretical ly, structural analysis is supposed to complement and com­
plete the other kinds of analysis, not to transcend them. It is responsible 
for defining the whole {the global level ) and for ascerta ining whether it 
embodies a logic - that is, a strategy accompanied by a measure of 
symbol ism (hence an  ' imaginary' component) . The relationship between 
the whole and the parts i s  bound up with general and well-known 
categories such as those of anaphora, metonymy and metaphor, but 
structural analysis introduces other, specific, categories into the dis­
cussion .  

We have already encountered a case where structural analysis adduces 
such specific categories : the case of the production of monumental space. 
The ancient world worked with heavy masses. Greek theory and practice 
achieved the effect o f  unity by using both gravity and the struggle against 
weigh t ;  vertical forces, both ascending and descending, were neutral ized 
and balanced without destroying the perception of volumes. Basing 
themselves on an identical principle, on the use of great volumes, the 
Romans exploited a complex arrangement of counterposed loads, sup­
ports and props, to obtain an effect of massiveness and strength 
unabashedly founded on weight. A less blatant structure, the outcome 
of an interplay between opposing forces, was typical of the Middle 
Ages ; balance and the effect of balance were assured by lateral thrusts; 
l ightness and elan were the order of the day. The modern period has 
seen the triumph of  weightlessness, though in a way sti l l  consistent with 



SOC I A L  SPACE 1 59  
the orientation o f  medieval arch itecture. Structural analysis i s  concerned, 
therefore, with clearly determined forces, as with the material relation­
ships obtaining between those forces - rela tionships which give rise to 
equally clearly determined spatial structures : columns, vaults, arches, 
p i l lars, and so on .  

Might i t  be sa id ,  then, that our analytic concepts correspond to 
certain classical terms, sti l l often used, referring to the production of 
architectural space :  that form and formal ana lysis correspond to 'compo­
sition ' ,  function to 'construction' ,  and structure to proportion, scale, 
rhythm and the various 'orders ' ? The answer is yes - up to a certa in 
point . The correspondence is sufficient, at any rate, to a l low for the 
translation of 'classica l '  texts, from Vitruvius to Viollet-le-Duc, into 
modern terms. But this terminological paral lel ism cannot be taken too 
far, because that would be to forget the context, the materials and 
materiel - to forget that 'composition' is informed by ideologies, that 
'construction' is  a function of  social relations, and that techniques, 
which have a great influence upon rhythm and upon the order of space, 
are l iable to change. 

As for the rather widely espoused view that the Greeks discovered a 
completely rational unity of form, function and structure, that this unity 
has been broken up in the course of history and that i t  needs to be 
restored, this hypothesis is a not unattractive one, but i t  takes no account 
of the new set of problems associated with the construction of ordinary 
bui ldings. The Greeks ' celebrated unity applies a lmost exclusively to 
monumental ity - to temple, stadium or agora. 

The nexus of problems relating to space and its production extends 
beyond the field of classica l architecture, beyond monuments and publ ic 
buildings, to take in the 'private' sphere, the sphere of ' residence' and 
'housing' . Indeed the relationship between private and public i s  now 
fundamenta l :  today the global picture i ncludes both these aspects, along 
with their relationship, and partial analyses, whether formal ,  functional 
or structural , must take this into account .  The West's 'classica l '  termin­
ology and perceptions must therefore be modified. The East may have 
something to teach the West in this regard, for the 'Asiat ic mode 
of production'  was a lways more apt to take 'private '  residence into 
consideration . At a l l  events, the categories of private and publ ic and the 
contrast between monuments and bui ldings must henceforth be integral 
to our paradigm. 

The tripartite approach founded on formal, functional and structural 
analyses cannot therefore be unreservedly endorsed as the method for 



1 60 SOC I A L  S PA C E  

deciphering socia l  spaces, for what is truly essential gets through the 
'grid' .  By all means let us adopt this approach, and make the best use 
of i t  we can, but caution is very much in order. 

I attempted earlier to show that semantic and semiologic;:il categories 
such as message, code and reading/writ ing could be appl ied only to 
spaces a l ready produced, and hence could not help us understand the 
actua l  production of space. Rela tionships basic to semantic or semiolog­
ical discussion wh ich may refer to space i n  one way or another include : 
with respect to signs, the relationship between sign ifier and signified, 
and that between symbol and meaning; with respect to value, that 
between the value-imparting element and the element invested with 
value, l ikewise that between the devaluing factor and the factor divested 
of value; and, lastly, the relationship between what has a referent and 
what does not. Of the fact that spaces may 'signify'  there can be no 
doubt. Is what is signified invariably contained by the signifier? Here, 
as elsewhere, the relationship of signifier to signified is susceptible to 
disj unction, distortion, instability, disparity, and substitutions. Consider 
the presence of Greek columns on the fa�ade of a stock exchange or 
bank, for example, or that of  a pseudo-agora in  a suburban 'new town'. 
What do such cases sign i fy ?  Certainly something other than what they 
appear or seek to signify :  specifically, the inabi l i ty of capital ism to 
produce a space other than capital ist space and its efforts to conceal 
that production as such, to erase any sign of the maximization of profit. 
Are there spaces which fa i l  to signify anything? Yes - some because 
they are neutral or empty, others because they a re overburdened with 
meaning. The former fal l  short of signification ; the latter overshoot it. 
Some 'over-signifying' spaces serve to scramble al l  messages and make 
any decoding impossible. Thus certa in spaces produced by capitalist 
promoters are so laden with signs - signs of wel l -being, happiness, style, 
a rt, riches, power, prosperity, and so on - that not only is their primary 
meaning ( that of profitabi l ity) effaced but meaning disappears 
altogether. 

I t  is possible, and indeed normal, to decipher or decode spaces. This 
presupposes coding, a message, a reading and readers. What codes are 
involved ? I use the plural advisedly, for it is doubtless as correct apropos 
of space as it is in the cases of  philosoph ica l and l i terary 'readings' .  The 
codes in  question, however, sti l l  have to be named and enumerated -
or else, should this prove impossible, the questions of how and why this 
is so should be answered, and the meaning of this state of a ffai rs 
explained. 

According to Roland Barthes, we a l l  have five codes avai lable to us 



SOC I A L  SPACE 1 6 1  

when reading a text .J8  First and foremost, the code o f  knowledge : on 
arrival in St Mark's Square, 'Ego' knows a certain number of things 
about Venice - about the doges, the Campani le, and so on. Memory 
floods his mind with a multitude of facts. Before long, he el ici ts another 
kind of  meaning as he begins reading this (materia l ized) text in a manner 
roughly corresponding to the use of concept of function, to the use of 
functional analysis . ( 'Roughly' is the operative word here, of course, 
because his comprehension does not extend much beyond some sense 
of the raison d'etre, or former raison d'etre, of the Doge's Palace, the 
Piombi or the Bridge of Sighs . )  He wil l  also inevitably latch onto a few 
symbols :  the l ion, the phal lus (the Campan i le ) ,  the chal lenge to the sea. 
Though he may have learnt to attach dates to these, he also perceives 
them as embodying 'values' that are still relevant - indeed eternal .  The 
disentanglement of these impressions from knowledge a l lows another 
code or reading - the symbolic one - to come into play. Meanwhile, 
'Ego' is  bound to feel some emotion : he may have been here before, 
long ago, or a lways dreamt of coming; he may have read a book or 
seen a film - Death in Venice perhaps. Such feel ings are the basis of 
the subjective and personal  code which now emerges, giving the decoding 
activity the musical qual i ties of a fugue:  the theme (i .e. this p lace - the 
Square, the Palace, and so on) mobil izes several voices in  a counterpoint 
in  which these are never either distinct or confused. Final ly, the simple 
empirical evidence of the paving-stones, the marble, the cafe tables leads 
'Ego' to ask h imself  quite unexpected questions - questions about truth 
versus i l lusion, about beauty versus the message, or about the meaning of 
a spectacle which cannot be 'pure' precisely because i t  arouses emotions. 

This kind of semantico-semiological research has gradual ly become 
more diversified. At the outset its theoretical project, on the basis of a 
strict ly interpreted distinction between signifier and signified, posited 
the existence of two codes and two codes only: a denotative code 
operating at a primary level ( that of che l i teral, the signified) which 
was acceptable to all l inguists, and a connotative code, operating at a 
secondary ( rhetorical ) level, which was rejected by the more scientifically 
minded l inguists as too vague a conception. More recently, however, 
the theory 's basic concepts (message, code, reading) have become more 
flexible;  a plura l istic approach has replaced the earlier strict insistence 
on an integral un i ty, and the former emphasis on consistency has given 
way to an emphasis on differences. The question is: how far can this

emphasis be carried, and how is difference to be defined in chis context?  
Barthes, for example, as we have seen, proposes five codes of equal 

importance and interest, worked our analytica lly a posteriori. Why five, 
rather than four or six, or some other number ? By what mechanism is 
the choice made between one and another of these codes ? And how are 
transitions made between them ? Is there nothing to which they do not 
apply ? Do they permit  a truly exhaustive decoding of a given text, 
whether it is made up of verbal or non-verbal  signs ? If, to the contrary, 
residual elements remain, are we to conclude that infinite analysis i s  
possib le ?  Or are we being referred impl icitly to a 'non-code' rea lm ? 

In point  of fact this approach leaves two areas untouched, one on the 
near side and the other on the far side, so to speak, of the readable/vis­
ible. On the near side, what is overlooked is the body. When 'Ego' 
arrives in  an unknown country or city, he first experiences ir through 
every part of his body - through his senses of smell and taste, as 
(provided he does not l imit  this by remaining in  his car) through his 
legs and feet. His hearing picks up the noises and the qual ity of the 
voices; h i s  eyes are assailed by new impressions. For i t  is by means of 
the body that space is perceived, l ived - and produced. On the far side 
of  the readable/visible, and equally absent from Barthes's perspective, is 
power. Whether or not it is constitutional ,  whether or not i t  is dissemi­
nated through institutions and bureaucracies, power can in no wise be 
decoded. For power has no code. The state has control of a l l  existing 
codes. I t  may on occasion invent new codes and impose them, but it is 
not itse lf  bound by them, and can shift from one to another at wi l l .  
The state manipulates codes. Power never a l lows itse l f  to be confined 
with in  a single logic. Power has only strategies - and thei r  complexity 
is in proportion to power's resources. S imi larly, in the case of power, 
signifier and sign ified coincide in the shape of violence - and hence 
death . Whether this violence is enacted in  the name of God, Prince, 
Father, Boss or Patrimony is a strictly secondary issue. 

I t  is pure i l lusion to suppose that thought can reach, grasp or define 
what i s  in space on the basis of propositions about space and general 
concepts such as message, code and readabi l ity. This i l lusion, which 
reduces both matter and space to a representation, is  in fact simply a 
version of spiritualism or idealism - a version which is surely common 
to a l l  who put polit ical power, and hence state power, in brackets, and 
so see nothing but things.  Cataloguing, classifying, decoding - none of 
these procedures gets beyond mere description. Empiricism, however, 
whether of the subtle or the crude variety, whether based on logic

or on the facts themselves, presupposes a conception of space which 
contradicts the premises of empiricism itse lf  in that it is incompatible 
as much with finite enumerations ( including a restricted muster of codes) 
as with the indeterminacy of unl imited analysis. There is a proper role 
for the decoding of space: it helps us understand the transition from 
representational spaces to representations of space, showing up corre­
spondences, analogies and a certain  unity in spatial practice and in the 
theory of space. The l imitations of the decoding-operation appear even 
greater, however, as soon as i t  is set in motion, for it then immediately 
becomes apparent j ust how many spaces exist, each of them susceptible 
of multiple decodings. 

Beginning with space-as-matter, paradigmatic contrasts prol iferated: 
abundance versus barrenness, congenia l ity versus hosti l i ty, and so on. 
It was upon this primary stratum of space, so to speak, that agricu ltural 
and pastoral activity la id down the earl iest networks: ur-places and their 
natural indicators; b lazes or way-markers with their init ial duality of 
meaning (direction/orientation, symmetry/asymmetry ) .  Later, absolute 
space - the space of religion - introduced the highly pertinent distinc­
tions between speech and writing, between the prescribed and the forbid­
den, between accessible and reserved spaces, and between ful l  and empty. 
Thus certain  spaces were carved out of nature and made complete by 
being filled to saturation point with beings and symbols, while other 
spaces were withdrawn from nature only to be kept empty as a way of 
symbolizing a transcendent real i ty at once absent and present. The 
paradigm became more complex as new contrasts came into play: 
with in/without, open/closed, movable/fixed. With the advent of h istori­
cal space, places became much more diverse, contrasting much more 
sharply with one another as they developed individual characteristics. 
City walls were the mark of a material and brutal separation far more 
potent than the formal polarities they embodied, such as curved-versus­
straight or open-versus-closed. This separation had more than one sig­
nification - and indeed implied more than any mere signification, in 
that the fortified towns he ld administrative sway over the surrounding 
countryside, which they protected and exploited at the same time (a 
common enough phenomenon, after a l l ) .  

Once d iversified, places opposed, sometimes complemented, and 
sometimes resembled one another. They can thus  be  categorized or  
subjected to a grid on the  basis of 'topias' ( isotopias, heterotopias, 
utopias, or in  other words analogous places, contrasting places, and the 
places of what has no place, or no longer has a place - the absolute, 



1 64 SOCI A L  SPACE 

the divine, or the possib le ) .  More importantly, such places can also be 
viewed in terms of the high ly significant distinction between dominated 
spaces and appropriated spaces. 

xv 

Before considering the distinction between domination and appropri­
ation, however, a word must be said about the relationsh ip between the 
basic axes of diachronic and synchronic. No space ever vanishes utterly, 
leaving no trace. Even the sites of Troy, Susa or Leptis Magna sti l l 
enshrine the superimposed spaces of the succession of ci ties that have 
occupied them. Were it otherwise, there would be no ' interpenetration ' , 
whether of spaces, rhythms or polarities. It is a lso true that each new 
addit ion inherits and reorganizes what has gone before ; each period or 
stratum carries its own preconditions beyond their l imits. Is this a case 
of metaphorization ? Yes, but it is one which includes a measure of 
metonymization in that the superimposed spaces do constitute an ensem­
ble or whole. These notions may not expla in the process in question, 
but they do serve a real expository function : they help describe how it 
is that natural (and hence physical and physiological ) space does not 
get completely absorbed into rel igious and political space, or these last 
into historical space, or any of the foregoing into that practico-sensory 
space where bodies and objects, sense organs and products all cohabit 
i n  'objectality ' .  What are being described in this way are metamorphoses, 
transfers and substitutions. Thus natural objects - a particular mound 
of earth , tree or hi l l - continue to be perceived as part of their contexts 
in nature even as the surrounding social space fills up with objects and 
comes also to be apprehended in accordance with the 'objectal i ty '  shared 
by natural objects on the one hand and by products on the other. 

Now let us consider dominated (and dominant) space, which is to 
say a _iiRace. transformed - and mediated - by .technology, l)x practL�� In 
the modern world, instances of such spaces are legion, and immediately

a_("e works of construction rather than 'works' in the sense in which we 
have been uSing the term, and they are not yet 'prodm:rs' in its narrow, 
modern and industrial meaning; dominant space is invariably the rea liz­
ation of a master's project . Th is may seem simple enough, but in fact 
the concept of dominated space cal ls for some elucidation. In order to 
dominate space, technology introduces a new form into a pre-existing 
space - generally a recti l inear or rectangular  form such as a meshwork 
or chequerwork. A motorway brutal izes the countryside and the land, 
s l ic ing through space l ike a great knife .  Dominated space is usual ly 
closed, steri l i zed, emptied out. The concept atta ins its ful l  meaning only 
when it is contrasted with the opposite and inseparable concept of 
appr_Qpriation.  

In Marx, the concept of appropriation is sharply opposed to that of 
property, but i t  is not thoroughly clarified - far from it, in fact. For 
one thing, i t  is not clearly distinguished from the anthropological and 
phi losophical notion of human nature ( i .e .  what is 'proper' to human 
beings ) ;  Marx had not entirely abandoned the search for a specific 
human nature, but he rejected any idea chat it might be consti tuted by 
laughter, by play, by the awareness of death, or by ' residence ' ;  rather, 
i t  lay in (socia l )  l abour and - inseparably - in language. Nor did Marx 
discriminate between appropriation and domination . For him labour 
and technology, by dominating material nature, thereby immediately 
transformed it  according to the needs of (socia l )  man. Thus nature was 
converted directly from an enemy, an indifferent mother, i nto 'goods' .  

Onjy by means of t.he critical study of .�ace, i n  fact, can the concept 
of appropriation be clarified. It may be said of a natural space modified 
in otaer to serve the needs and poss ib i l i ties of a group that it has been 
appropriated hy that group. Proper_1y in the sense of possession is

-
at 

best a necessary precondition, and most often merely an epiphenomenon, 
of 'appropriative' activity, the h ighest expression of which is the work 
of"art. An appropriated space resembles a work of art, which is not to 
say that  it is in any sense an imitation work of a rt. Often such a space 
is a structure - a monument or bui lding - but this is not a lways the 
case : a site, a square or a street may also be legitimately described as 
an appropriated space. Examples of appropriated spaces abound, but it 
is not a lways easy to decide in  what respect, how, by whom and for 
whom they have been appropriated. 

Peasant houses and v i l lages speak : they recount, though in  a mumbled 
and somewhat confused way, the l ives of those who built and inhabited 
them. An igloo, an  Oriental straw hut or a Japanese house is every bit 



166  SOCIAL SPACE 

as expressive as a Norman or Provern;al dwel l ing. 3 9  Dwell ing-space may 
be that of a group (of a family, often a very large one) or that of a 
communi ty (a lbeit one divided into castes or c lasses which tend to break 
i t  up). Pr\vate space is distinct from, but always conne_cted with, publ ic 
space. I n  the best of circumstances, the outsid� space of the community 
is dominated, while the i1!4oor sr_ace o( fami ly l i fe is-appropriated.40 A 
s ituation of this kind exempl ifies a spatia l practicewhich, th"ough stil l 
immediate, is close, i n  concrete terms, to the work of art. Whence the 
charm, the enduring abi l i ty to enchant us, of houses of this kind. It 
should be noted that appropriation is not effected by an immobile group, 
be it a fami ly, a vi l lage or a town;  time plays a part in the process, and 
indeed appropriation cannot be understood apart from the rhythms of 
time and of l i fe. 

Dominated space and appropriated space may in  principle be com­
bined - and, ideally at  least, they ought to be combined. But h istory -
which is to say the history of accumulation - is also the history of 
their separation and mutual antagonism. The winner in this contest, 
moreover, has been domination . There was once such a thing as appro­
priation without domination - witness the aforementioned hut, igloo or 
peasant house. Domination has grown pari passu with the part played 
by armies, war, the state and pol itical power. The dichotomy between 
dominated and appropriated is thus not l imited to the level of discourse 
or signification, for it gives rise to a contradiction or conflictual tendency 
which holds sway unti l  one of the terms in play (domination) wins a 
crushing victory and the other (appropriation) is utterly subjugated. Not 
that appropriation disappears, for i t  cannot: both practice and theory 
continue to procla im its importance and demand its restitution. 

Similar considerations apply to the body and to sexual ity .  Dominated 
by overpowering forces, including a variety of brutal techniques and 
an extreme emphasis on visual ization, the body fragments, abdicates 
responsibi l i ty for itsel f - in a word, disappropriates itse lf. Body cultu res 
and body techniques have been developed, in antiquity and since, which 
tru ly appropriate the body. Sports and gymnastics as we know them, 
however, to say noth ing of the passive exposure of the body to the sun, 
a re little more than parodies or s imulations of  a genuine 'physica l  
culture ' .  Any revolutionary 'project' today, whether utopian or rea l istic, 
must, if i t  is to avoid hopeless banal ity, make the reappropriation of

SOCIAL SPACE 1 67 
the body, in association with the reappropriation of space, into a non­
negotiable part of i ts agenda. 

As for sex and sexuality, things here are more complicated. It may 
reasonably be asked whether an appropriation of sexual i ty has ever 
occurred except perhaps under certain transitory sets of  circumstances 
and for a very l imited number of people (one th inks, for example, of 
Arab civi l ization in Andalusi a ) .  Any true appropriation of sex demands 
that a separation be made between the reproductive function and sexual 
pleasure. Th is is a delicate distinction which, for reasons that are st i l l  
mysterious, and despite great scientific advances in the sphere of contra­
ception, can only be made i n  practice with great difficulty and attendant 
anxiety. We do not real ly know how and why this occurs, but i t  seems 
that detaching the biological sexual function from the 'human' one -
which cannot properly be defined in terms of functional i ty - results 
only in the l atter being compromised by the el imination of the former. 
It is a lmost as though 'nature' were itself incapable of distinguishing 
between pleasure and pain, so that when human beings are encouraged 
by the ir  analytical tendencies to seek the one in isolation from the other 
they expose themselves to the risk of neutral izing both . Alternatively, 
they may be obl iged to limit a l l  orgiastic pleasure to predictable states 
reached by codified routes (drugs, eroticism, reading/writing of ready­
made texts, etc. ) .  

The true space o f  pleasure, which would b e  an  appropriated space 
par excellence, does not yet exist. Even i f  a few instances in the past 
suggest that this goal is in principle attainable, the results to date fal l  
far short of human desi res. 

Appropriation should not be confused with a practice which is closely 
related to i t  but sti l l  distinct, namely 'diversion' (detournement) .  An 
existing space may outl ive its origina l  purpose and the raison d'etre 
which determines i ts forms, functions, and structures; it may thus in a 
sense become vacant, and susceptible of being diverted, reappropriated 
and put to a use quite d ifferent from its init ia l  one. A recent and well­
known case of this was the reappropriarion of the Hai les Centrales, 
Paris's former wholesale produce market, in  1 969-7 1 .  For a brief period, 
this urban centre, designed to faci l i tate the distribution of food, was 
transformed into a gathering-place and a scene of permanent festival -
in short, into a centre of play rather than of work - for the youth of 
Paris .  

The diversion and reappropriation of space are of great significance, 
for they teach us much about the production of new spaces. During a 
p�iod as difficult as the present one is for a (capita�st) mode of

it may even be _ t_hat  such techniques of diversion have greater import 
than attempts . .  at .cr.eatirui��cffcJ"n). ·Be· that- as i t  may, one upshot 
of such tactics is that groups take up residence in spaces whose pre­
existing form, having been designed for some other purpose, is  inappro­
priate to the needs of their would-be communal l i fe. One wonders 
whether this morphological maladaptation m ight not play a part in the 
high incidence of fai lure among communitarian experiments of this kind. 

From a purely theoretical standpoint, diversion and production cannot 
be meaningful ly separated. The goa l  and meaning of theoretical thinking 
is production rather than diversion . Diversion is in  itself merely appropri­
ation, not creation - a reappropriation which can call but a temporary 
ha l t  to domination .

Having assigned ontological status by speculative diktat to che most 
extreme degree of formal abstraction, classical phi losophical (or 
metaphysica l )  thought posits a substantial space, a space ' in itself ' .  From 
the beginning of the Ethics, Spinoza treats this absolute space as an 
attribute or mode of absolute being - that is ,  of God. 1 Now space ' in 
itself', defined as infinite, has no shape in chat it has no content. It may 
be assigned neither form, nor orientation, nor direction . Is i c  then the 
unknowable?  No: rather, i t  is what Leibniz called the ' indiscernible' .  

In the matter of Leibniz's criticism of Spinoza and Desca rtes, as in  
that  of Newton's and Kant's criticism of Leibniz, modern mathematics 
tends to find in favour of Leibniz.2 For the most part, phi losophers have 
taken the existence of an absolute space as a given, along with whatever 
it might conta in :  figures, relations and proportions, numbers, and so 
on. Against this posture, Leibniz maintains that space 'in itself', space 
as such, is neither 'nothing' nor 'something' - and even less the total i ty 
of things or the form of their sum; for Leibniz space was, indeed, the 
indiscernible. In order to discern 'someth ing' therein, axes and an origin 
must be introduced, and a right and a left, i .e. the direction or orientation 
of those axes. This does not mean, however, that Leibniz espouses the 
'subject iv ist' thesis according to wh ich the observer and the measure 
together constitute the rea l .  To the contrary, what Leibniz means to say 
is that i t  is necessary for space co be occupied. What, then, occupies

space ? A body - not bodies in general, nor corporea l i ty, but a specific 
body, a body capable of indicating direction by a gesture, of defining 
rotation by turning round, of demarcating and orienting space. Thus 
for Leibniz space is absolutely relative - that is, endowed both with a 
perfectly abstract qual ity which leads mathematical thought to treat i t  
as primordial ( and hence readi ly to invest it with transcendence) , and 
with a concrete character ( in that it is in space that bodies exist, that 
they manifest their material existence) . How does a body 'occupy' 
space ? The metaphorical term 'occupy' is borrowed from an everyday 
experience of space as already specific, already 'occupied' . The connec­
tion between space as 'avai lable' and space as 'occupied ' ,  however, has 
nothing simple or obvious about it. Unfortunately, a metaphor cannot 
do duty for thought. We know that space is not a pre-existing void, 
endowed with formal properties alone. To cri ticize and reject absolute 
space is simply to refuse a particular representation, that of a container 
waiting to be fil led by a content - i.e. matter, or bodies. According to 
this picture of things, ( formal )  content and (materia l )  container are 
indifferent to each other and so offer no graspable difference. Any thing 
may go in any 'set' of places in the container. Any part of the container 
can receive anything. This indifference becomes separation, in that con­
tents and container do not impinge upon one another in any way. An 
empty container accepts any col lection of separable and separate items; 
separateness thus extends even to the contents' component elements; 
fragmentation replaces thought, and thought, reflective thinking, 
becomes hazy and may eventual ly be swal lowed up in the empirical 
activity of simply counting things. The constitution of such a ' logic of 
separation' entai ls and justifies a strategy of separation. 

We are thus obl iged to consider a contrary hypothesis. C<in th!!_ body,

clearly in h i s  work on  symmetry. 3 In nature, whether organic or in­
organic, symmetries ( in a plane or about an axis) exist wherever there 
is bi laterality or dual ity, left and right, ' reflection ' ,  or rotation (in space) ; 
these symmetries are not properties external to bodies, however. Though 
definable in 'purely' mathematical terms - as applications, operations, 
transformations or functions - they are not imposed upon materia l  
bodies, as many  philosophers suppose, by  prior thought. Bodies -
deployments of energy - produce space and produce themselves, along 
with their motions, according to the laws of space. And this remains 
true, Wey! argues, whether we are concerned with corpuscles or planets, 
crystals, 4 electromagnetic fields,5 cel l  division, 6 shel ls, or a rchitectura l  
forms, to  which last Wey! attributes great importance. Here then we 
have a route from abstract to concrete which has the great virtue of 
demonstrating their reciprqcal inherence. Th is path leads a lso from 
mental to socia l ,  a fact which lends additional force to the concept of 
the production of space. 

This thesis is so persuasive that there seems to be little reason for not 
extending its appl ication - with a l l  due precautions, naturally - to social 
space. This would give us the concept of a specific space produced by 
forces ( i .e .  productive forces) deployed within a (social and 
determined/determining) spatia l  practice. Such a space would embody 
'properties' (dual ities, symmetries, etc . )  which could not be imputed 
either to the human mind or to any transcendent spirit, but only to the 
actual 'occupation' of space, an occupation which would need to be 
understood genetically - that is, according to the sequence of productive 
operations involved. 

What does this mean for the ancient idea of nature ?  It means that it 
must undergo quite substantial transformation. Once the relationship 
of mutual inherence between space and what i t  contained was broken, 
reflective thought tended to bring occul t  qual ities and forces into the 
picture. Everything which derives from biologico-spatial real i ty - every­
thing wh ich is, in a word, 'automorphic' or ' biomorphic' - was endowed 
in this way with goal-directedness: symmetries now seemed to have been

and Empirio-Criticism? Noc exactly; Wey! would probably feel that Lenin asked the right 
question - bur rook bad aim and missed the target.

planned by a calcu lating God and rea l ized on the material plane by 
order of a divine wi l l  or power. How did it come about that that flower 
which knew not that it was a flower, or that it was beaut iful ,  possessed 
a symmetry of the nth order?  The answer was that it had been designed, 
by Spinoza's natura naturans or by Leibniz's mathematician God. 

Many, l ike Descartes and his fol lowers, though they found i t  hard to 
bel ieve in any such engineering, simply shifted agency to a 'spirit ' , 
whether human or not, without attending too closely to the matter of 
how that spirit's 'design ' might be rea lized otherwise than through the 
providential or transcendent action of the Idea ( in the Hegel ian sense ) .  
How and in what sense nature as such can 'be '  mathematical is a 
question which the phi losophers, with the ir  scientific-cum-ideological 
partitions, have rendered unintel l igible. The observer stands perplexed 
before the beauty of a seashel l ,  a v i l lage or a cathedra l ,  even though 
what confronts h im consists perhaps merely in the material modal ities 
of an active 'occupation· - specifical ly ,  the occupation of space. Inciden­
tally, one may well wonder whether the ' integrons' proposed by Frarn;ois 
Jacob as a way of accounting for organic uni ty are rea l ly anything more 
than a phi losophical/ideological/scientific device standing in  for divine 
providence. 7 

There is another way of approaching the question, however :  develop­
ment in nature may be conceived of as obeying laws of space which are 
a lso laws of nature. Space as such (as at once occupied and occupying, 
and as a set of places) may be understood in  a materia l ist way. A space 
so understood impl ies differences by definit ion, which gets us out of a 
number of difficulties related to the genesis of variations: we a re no 
longer obl iged to appeal either to origina l i ty or to origins as the source 
of d ifference ; nor need we risk fal l ing under the axe of the materia l ist 
critique of empirio-criticism. From this perspective, the form of a seashell 
is the result neither of  a 'design' nor of 'unconscious' thought, nor yet 
of a 'h igher' p lan .  The poetry of shells - their metaphorical role8 - has 
nothing to do with some mysterious creative force, but corresponds 
merely to the way in  which energy, under specific conditions (on a 
specific sca le, in a specific material environment, etc . ) ,  is deployed; the 
relationship between nature and space is  immediate in the sense that it 
does not depend on the mediation of an externa l  force, whether natural

or divine. The law of space resides with in  space itsel f, and cannot be 
resolved into a deceptively clear inside-versus-outside relationship, which 
is merely a representation of space. Marx wondered whether a spider 
could be said to work . Does a spider obey blind instinct? Or  does it 
have (or perhaps better, is it ) an intel l igence ? Is it aware in any sense 
of what i t  is doing? It produces, i t  secretes and it occupies a space which 
i t  engenders according to its own l ights :  the space of its web, of i ts 
stratagems, of its needs. Should we think of this space of the spider's 
as an  abstract space occupied by such separate objects as its body, its 
secretory glands and legs, the things to which i t  attaches its web, the 
strands of  silk making up that web, the flies that serve as its prey, and 
so on ? No, for th is  would be to set the spider in  the space of analytic 
intel lection, the space of discourse, the space of this sheet of paper 
before me, thus preparing the ground too inevitably for a rejoinder of 
the type : 'Not at a l l ! I t  is nature (or instinct, or providence) which 
governs the spider's activity and which is thus responsible for that 
admirable and tota l ly marvel lous creation, the spider's web with its 
amazing equi l ibrium, organization, and adaptabi l ity . '  Would it be true 
to say that the spider spins the web as an extension of i ts body ? As far 
as it goes, yes, but the formulation has its problems. As for the web's 
symmetrical and asymmetrical aspects and the spatial structures 
(anchorage points, networks, centre/periphery) that it embodies, is the 
spider's knowledge of these comparable to the human form of know­
ledge ? Clearly not: the spider produces, which manifestly cal ls for 
'thought' , but it does not 'think' in  the same way as we do. The spider's 
'production' and the characteristics thereof have more in common with 
the seashell or  with the flower evoked by the 'Angel of Si lesia '  than 
with verbal abstraction. Here the production of space, beginning with 
the production of the body, extends to the productive secretion of a 
'residence' which also serves as a tool, a means. This construction is 
consistent with those laws classical ly described as 'admirable' .  Whether 
any dissociation is conceivable in this connection between nature and 
design, organic and mathematical, producing and secreting, or interna l  
and external , is a question which must  be answered - resoundingly -
in the negative. Thus the spider, for a l l  its ' lowliness ' ,  is a l ready capable, 
just l ike human groups, of demarcating space and orienting itse lf  on 
the basis of angles. It can create networks and l inks, symmetries and 
asymmetries. It is able to project beyond its own body those dualities 
which help constitute that body as they do the animal 's relationship to 
itsel f  and its p roductive and reproductive acts. The spider has a sense 
of right and left, of h igh and low. Its 'here and now' (in Hegel 's sense)

transcends the rea lm of 'thingness' ,  for it embraces relationships and 
movements. We may say, then, that for any l iv ing body, just as for 
spiders, shel l fish and so on, the most basic places and spatia l  indicators 
are first of  all qualified by that body. The 'other' is present, facing the 
ego : a body facing another body. The 'other' is impenetrable save 
through violence, or through love, as the object of expenditures of 
energy, of aggression or desire. Here externa l  i s  also internal inasmuch 
as the 'other' is  another body, a vulnerable flesh, an accessible symmetry. 
Only later on in the development of the human species were spatial 
indicators quanti fied. Right  and left, h igh and low, central and peripheral 
(whether named or no) derived from the body in action . It seems that 
i t  is  not so much gestures which do the qualifying as the body as a 
whole. To say that the qual ification of space depends on the body 
implies that space is determined by something that at  times threatens 
and at  times benefits it .  This determination appears to have three aspects : 
gestures, traces, marks. 'Gesture' should be taken here in a broad sense, 
so that turning around may be considered a gesture, one which modifies 
a person's orientation and points of reference. The word is preferable 
to 'behaviour', for a gestural action has a goal or a im (which is not, of 
course, to imply some immanent teleology) .  A spider moving around on 
its web or a shel lfish emerging from i ts shell are performing gestures in  
th i s  sense. As for traces and marks, these obviously do not  exist as 
'concepts' for the spider, and yet everything happens ' just as though' 
they d id .  Marks are made by l iving beings with the means readily 
avai lable to them, notably excreta such as urine, sal iva, and so on.  
Sexual  marks must be very ancient (but to what - or to whom - were 
they first a ffixed ? ) .  As i ndicators merely of affect, however, marks would 
appear to be of much more recent origin ,  and l imited to few species. 
Intentional i ty is a late development, accompanying that of brain and 
hands, but traces and marks play a part in  animal l i fe from a very 
early date. Places were already being marked (and 're-marked' ) .  In the 
beginning was the T opos. Before - long before - the advent of the 
Logos, i n  the chiaroscuro realm of primitive l ife, l ived experience a lready 
possessed i ts i nternal rational ity ;  th is experience was producing long 
before thought space, and spatia l  thought, began reproducing the projec­
tion, explosion, image and orientation of the body. Long before space, 
as perceived by and for the 'I', began to appear as spl it and divided, as 
a rea lm of merely virtual or deferred tensions and contacts. Long before 
space emerged as a medium of far-off possibi l ities, as the locus of 
potential i ty .  For, long before the analys ing, separating inte l lect, long 
before formal knowledge, there was an intel l igence of the body.

Time is distinguishable but not separable from space. The concentric 

rings of a tree trunk reveal the tree 's age, j ust as a shel l ' s  spirals, with 
their 'marvel lous' spatia l  concreteness, reveal the age of that shell 's 
former occupant - this according to rules which only compl icated 
mathematical operations can 'translate' into the language of abstraction .  
Times, of necessity, are loca l ;  and  th is goes too for the relations between 
places and their respective times. Phenomena which an analytical intell i­
gence associates solely with 'temporal i ty ' ,  such as growth, maturation 
and aging, cannot in fact be dissociated from 'spatial ity' { i tself an 
abstraction) .  Space and time thus appear and manifest themselves as 
different yet unseverable. Temporal cycles correspond to circular  spatia l  
forms of a symmetrical k ind .  It may  even be  that l inear temporal 
processes of a repetitive and mechanical character are associated with 
the constitution of spatial axes (a long which a repeated operation may 
be performed) .  At a l l  events, the dissociation of spatial and temporal 
and the socia l  actual ization of that dissociation can only be a late 
development, a corol lary of which has been the split between represen­
tations of space and representational spaces. It is by taking represen­
tational spaces as i ts starting-point that art seeks to preserve or restore 
this lost unity.9 

All of which gives us some sense of how and to what degree dual i ty 
is constitutive of the unity of the material l iving being. Such a being 
carries its 'other' within itsel f. It is symmetrical ,  hence dual - and doubly 
so, for its symmetry is both bi lateral and rotationa l ;  and this state of 
affairs must in  turn be v iewed through the dual lens of space and time, 
of cycl ical repetition and l inear repetition. 

Around the l iving being, and through its activity, which may legit­
imately be described as 'productive', is constituted the field which the 
behaviourists call ' behavioura l ' .  This field comes into play as a network 
of relations, a network projected and simultaneously actual ized by the 
living being as i t  acts within, in conjunction with, and upon, i ts spatial 
'mil ieu' . The rea lm of ' behaviour' thus bears spatial characteristics deter­
mined by the projection in question :  right-left symmetry, h igh versus 
low, and so on. 

At the same t ime, the l iv ing being constitutes itsel f from the outset as 
an interna l  space. Very early on, in  phylogenesis as in  the genesis of the 
individual organism, an indentation forms in the cel lu lar mass. A cavity

gradual ly takes shape, simple at first, then more complex,  which is fil led 
by fluids. These fluids too are relatively simple to begin with, but 
diversify l i ttle by l i ttle. The cel ls adjacent to the cavity form a screen or 
membrane which serves as a boundary whose degree of permeabi lity 
may vary. From now on external space wi l l  stand opposed to an  internal 
space or mi l ieu : here is the primary and most decisive differentiation i n  
t he  h istory of  biological being. The internal mi l ieu w i l l  play an ever­
greater role ;  and the space thus produced wi l l  eventually take on the 
most varied forms, structures and functions, beginning with an init ial 
stage at  which i t  has the form of what the embryologists cal l  a 'gastrula ' .  

A closure thus comes to separate within from without, so establ ishing 
the l iving being as a 'distinct body' .  It is  a quite relative closure, however, 
and has nothing in common with a logical division or abstract split . 
The membranes in question general ly remain permeable, punctured by 
pores and orifices. Traffic back and forth, so far from stopping, tends 
to increase and become more differentiated, embracing both energy 
exchange (a l imentation, resp iration, excretion) and information 
exchange ( the sensory apparatus ) .  The whole h istory of l i fe has been 
characterized by an  i ncessant d iversification and intensification of  the 
interaction between inside and outside. 

Thus rela tivized and emancipated from extrapolations and systemati­
zations, the notion of 'closure' has an operational uti l ity: it helps to 
account for what happens in  both natural and socia l  l i fe .  In the social 
rea lm, closures tend to become absolute. A defining characteristic of  
(private)  property, as of the position in  space of a town,  nation or 
nation state, is  a closed frontier. This l imit ing case aside, however, we 
may say that every spatial envelope implies a barrier between inside and 
out, but that this barrier is a lways relative and, in the case of membranes, 
always permeable. 

II 

From a dynamic standpoint, the l iving organism may be defined as an 
apparatus which, by a variety of means, captures energies active in  its 
vicinity. It absorbs heat, performs respiration, nourishes itself, and so 
on. I t  also, as a 'normal' thing, retains and stocks a surplus of avai lable 
energy over and above what i t  needs for deal ing with immediate demands 
and attacks . This al lows the organ ism a measure of leeway for taking 
init iatives (these being neither determined nor arbitrary ) .  This  surplus 
or superfluity of energy is what distinguishes l i fe from survival (the bare 



SPATlAL ARCH ITECTO N I CS 177 

minimum needed to support l i fe) . Captive energy is not genera l ly stored 
indefinitely or preserved in  a stagnant state. When i t  is, the organism 
degenerates. It is in  the nature of energy that it be expended - and 
expended productively, even when the 'production' involved is merely 
that of  play or of gratuitous violence. The release of energy always gives 
rise to an  effect, to damage, to a change in rea lity. I t  modifies space or 
generates a new space. Living or vital energy seems active only if  there 
is an excess, an avai lable surplus, superfluity and an actual  expenditure 
thereof. In effect, energy must be wasted; and the explosive waste of 
energy is indistingu ishable from its productive use: beginning on the 
plane of animal l i fe, p lay, struggle, war and sex are coextensive. Pro­
duction, destruction and reproduction overlap and intersect. 

Energy accumulates: so much is obvious - a truism.  It  is d ifficult, 
however, to form a clear picture of the mechanisms of this accumulation, 
and even more so of its consequences. Even though the expenditure of 
energy a lways seems 'excessive', even ' abnormal ' ,  a l iv ing organism 
which does not have access to such a surplus, and hence to the poss ibi l i ­
t ies which that surplus opens up, has quite different reactions to i ts 
immediate circumstances. 

In other words, that 'principle of economy' which has so often been 
put forward by a particular kind of rational ism or crude functional ism 
is biological ly and 'b iomorphical ly' inadequate. It is a low-level principle 
applied only to situations where a short supply of energy cal ls for 
restrictions on expenditure. I t  applies, in other words, only at the level 
of survival .  

In sharp contrast to  the rational ism of the  'principle of economy' and 
i t s  niggardly productivism ( the minimum expenditure - and th i s  on ly  in  
order to  satisfy 'needs' )  is the  opposite thesis, espoused by a succession 
of phi losophers, according to which waste, play, struggle, art, festival 
- in short, Eros - are themselves a necessity, and a necessity out of 
which the partisans of this view make a v irtue. The pedigree of the 
phi losophical endorsement of excess, of superfluity - and hence of 
transgression - in this connection goes back to Spinoza ;  it may be traced 
thence, via Schi l ler, Goethe, and Marx - who detested asceticism, even 
if he sometimes al lowed h imself to be seduced by the notion of a 
'proletarian' version of it - to i ts culmination in Nietzsche. There i s  
l ittle trace of i t ,  be i t  noted, in Freud, whose bio-energetic theories tend 
to col l apse into mechanism. The psychoanalytic distinctions between 
Eros and Thanatos, pleasure principle and real i ty (or productivity) prin­
ciple, and l i fe and death instincts, too often lose a l l  dialectical character 
and become l i ttle more than a mechanical interplay between pseudo-



1 78 SPATI A L  A R C H I TECTO N I CS 

concepts - l i ttle more than metaphors for a supposed scarcity of energy. 
If the l iving organ ism indeed captures, expends and wastes a surplus 

of energy, it must do so in accordance with the laws of the universe. 
The Dionysian side of existence - excess, intoxication, risks (even mortal 
risks) - has i ts own peculiar freedom and value. The l iving organism 
and the total body contain with in  them the potential for play, violence, 
festival and love (wh ich is not to say that this potential must necessarily 
be real ized, nor even that any motivation to do so need be present) . 

The Nietzschean distinction between Apollonian and Dionysian 
echoes the dual aspect of the l iving being and its relationship to space 
- i ts own space and the other's : violence and stabi l ity, excess and 
equi l ibr ium. Inadequate as th is  distinction may be,  i t  is certain ly mean­
ingfu l .  

It i s  not  sufficient, however, to  say of the  l iv ing organism merely that 
it captures energy and uses it in  an 'economic' manner: it does not 
capture j ust any energy, nor does it expend that energy in  an arbitrary 
way. It has its own specific prey, surroundings and predators - in a 
word, its own space. It l ives in that space, and it is a component part 
of it - a part, that is, of a fauna or flora, and of an ecology, a more or 
less stable ecological system. Within its space, the l iv ing being receives 
information. Original ly, before the advent of the abstraction devised by 
human societies, information was no more distinct from materia l  real ity 
than the content of space was from its form: the cel l  receives information 
in  material form. There is a systematic philosophical tendency among 
the investigators of such phenomena, however, to reduce the l iving being 
- whether at the level of the individual cel l or at the level of the organism 
as a cel lular whole - to terms of information reception;  that is to say, 
to terms of minute quantities of energy . 10 They disregard or ignore the 
economy of the l iv ing body as recipient and reservoir of massive energies. 
Though they put all the emphasis on the organism's sel f-regulatory 
mechanisms, they no longer discern those mechanisms' dysfunctions, 
defects, errors, or excessive outlays of energy . The dual regulatory 
system based on organic substances and catalysts which biology proposes 
is  apparently supposed to leave nothing out of account. It is true 
that energetic theories, for their part, have paid no attention to the 
informational ,  relational or situational realms, concentrating exclusively

on the grosser forms of energy - those which can, so to speak, be 
measured in calories. The truth is, however, that in its relationship to 
itself and its own space the l iving being uses both minimal and massive 
types of energy (which are in any case not strictly separable) . The 
organism thus combines apparatuses storing enormous quantities of 
energy which are discharged explosively (musculature, sexual apparatus, 
members) with apparatuses designed to respond to very feeble stimul i  
- i .e .  in formation - and to consume barely any energy (the sensory 
apparatus :  the brain and sense organs ) .  1 1  What we find here, therefore 
- or, rather, what we come back to - is a constitutive dualism. The 
l iv ing being is not merely a data-processing machine, nor merely a 
desiring, ki l l ing or producing machine - it is both at once. 

Around the l iving organism, both those energies which i t  captures 
and those which threaten i t  are mobile: they are 'currents' or ' flows'. 
By contrast, in order to capture available energies the organism must 
have at i ts disposal apparatuses which are stable. It must respond to 
aggression with defensive actions, setting up boundaries around the 
body that it can maintain and protect. 

The fact that a surplus of energy is accumulated before being dis­
charged is  thus a defining aspect of  the very concept of the ' l iv ing body' 
and its relationship with its space - i .e .  with itself, its vicinity, its 
surroundings, and the world at large. A productive squandering of  
energy i s  not  a contradiction in terms: an expenditure of energy may 
be deemed 'productive' so long as some change, no matter how small, 
is thereby effected in the world .  The concept of production is thus 
sharpened and revived without becoming so broad as to lose a l l  meaning: 
we see that a game may qual ify as a piece of work, or as a work in the 
strong sense of the word, while a space designed for playfu l  activity 
may legitimately be deemed a product in that it is the outcome of an 
activi ty which regulates i tself ( lays down rules for itself) as  i t  unfolds. 
Furthermore, productive energy impl ies the l iv ing organism's relation­
ship with itsel f, and in this connection takes the form of reproductive 
energy; as such it is characterized by repetition - repetition in the 
division and multipl ication of cel ls, in actions, in reflexes. As for sexual 

1 1  This has been wel l  brought out by Georges Bata i l le, elaborating on a Nietzschean 
theme in his La part maudite, essai d"tfconomie gtfntfra/e ( Paris :  Editions de Minuit, 1 949) ;  
Eng. t r .  by Robert Hurley: The A ccursed Share: An Essay on General Economy, vol .  I 
(New York: Zone Books, 1 988 ) .  It would be unjust nor to give credi t  here to Wilhelm 
Reich for h i s  contribution to the development of an energetic theory (and this  in a 
much-disparaged period of his work).  Cf. also a Yugoslavian film which comments not 
unhumorously on this issue: Dusan Makavejev"s WR : Mysteries of the Organism ( 1 972 ) .

reproduction, it is merely one of many forms of reproduction essayed 
by nature, a form which owes its prominent status solely to i ts success 
down several l ines of descent. In the case of sexual reproduction, the 
discontinuous or explosive aspect of productive energy has manifestly 
won out over continuous production, over sprouting and prol iferation. 

Surplus energy qua 'normal '  energy relates on the one hand to itself, 
i .e .  to the body which stores it, and on the other hand to i ts 'mi l ieu', 
i .e .  to space. In the l i fe of every 'being' - species, individual or group 
- there a re moments when the energy avai lable is so abundant that it 
tends to be explosively discharged. It may be turned back against itsel f, 
or it may spread outwards, in gratuitousness or grace. The incidence of  
destruction, self-destruction, aimless violence and suicide is h igh in  
nature general ly and even higher in the human species. Excesses of a l l  
k inds are the result of excess energy, as Batai l le understood in the 
wake of  N ietzsche (a l though he was perhaps somewhat excessive in  his  
application of this rule itself) . 

It fol lows that Freud's celebrated 'death instinct' should be treated as 
a derivative phenomenon. The symptomatic study which psychoanalysts 
s ince Freud have made of  morbid tendencies and drives has generated 
a great deal of  accurate data in the 'fields' wh ich fal l  under such rubrics 
as Eros and Thanatos, narcissism, sado-masochism, self-destructiveness, 
eroticism, anxiety, and neurosis and psychosis, but al l  th is work has 
only made any appeal to a primordial tendency here even more dubious. 
There is a drastic difference between the notion of a death instinct or 
dr ive,  a force seeking annihi lation and running counter to a forever 
thwarted l i fe-affirming tendency, and the thesis of a whiplash effect 
resu lting from basica l ly justified excesses in the expenditure of vital 
energy. Even though we are bound to assume that the ' negation' of 
energy exists in space - that is, in the milieu in which energy is expended, 
diffused and dissipated - this is not to say that death and self-destruction 
are causes or reasons rather than effects. Thus the 'death instinct' simply 
implies an unproductive use or misuse - a 'misemployment', so to speak 
- of basic energy. It is the dialectical outcome of a conflictual relationship 
internal to this energy, a relationship which cannot be reduced to mere 
mechanisms of defence or of equi l ibrium and their fai lures. There is 
sense in a joyful  pessimism.

In the foregoing discussion space has been taken partes extra partes, as 
Spinoza would say. That we are dealing with finiteness, with parts and 
subdivisions, with component elements, and with each part's uniqueness 
and origins ( its 'etymology ' )  - of this there can be no doubt. The very 
concept of a form, with an internal sel f- ' reflection' or dupl icate of itself 
as its defining characteristic - the concept, in other words, of symmetry 
with i ts constitutive dualisms ( reflectional symmetry and rotational sym­
metry, asymmetry as i tsel f  determined by symmetry, and so on) - implies 
a circumscribed space : a body with contours and boundaries. Obviously, 
however, it is not enough merely to evoke subdivisions of space and 
a llotments of energy : currents flow and propagate themselves within an 
infinite space. ' Infinity is the original fact; what has to be expla ined is 
the source of the finite' ,  writes Nietzsche. ' In infinite t ime and in infinite 
space there are no terminal points . '  Here thought is overcome by a kind 
of vertigo. Yet, he adds, 'Though it has noth ing to hold on to, humanity 
must somehow stand upright - therein l ies the immense task of the 
artist . '  But Nietzsche assigns no absolute, general or tota l priority to 
the imagination . 1 2  

Could the infinite and the finite b e  mere i l lusion, the one just a s  much 
as the other, and each, as it were, the i l lusion of the other ?  Are they 
mirages, reflections or refractions, or in some sense that which l ies short 
of - and beyond - each part ? Time per se is an absurdity ;  l ikewise space 
per se. The relative and the absolute are reflections of one another: each 
always refers back to the other, and the same is true of space and time. 
We are confronted by a double surface, a double appea rance which is 
governed by a single law and a single real i ty, that of reflection/refraction. 
The maximum difference is contained in every difference, even a minimal 
one. 'Every form belongs to the subject. It is the apprehension of the 
surface by the mirror. ' u

By thus engendering su rface, image 1 4  and m irror, reflection pierces the 
surface and penetrates the depths of the relationship between repetition 
and difference. Dupl ication (symmetry) impl ies repetition, yet it a lso 
gives rise to a difference constitutive of a space. It  should not be 
conceived of on the model of numerical i teration ( 1  and 1 and 1, etc . ) ,  
nor on that of seria l  recurrence . Rather the opposi te : duplication and 
symmetry/asymmetry call for causal notions irreducible to classical 
(seria l  and linear) ideas. When the mi rror is 'rea l ' ,  as is constantly the 
case in the realm of objects, the space in the mirror is imaginary - and 
(cf. Lewis Carrol l )  the locus of the imagination is the 'Ego' .  In a living 
body, on the other hand, where the mirror of reflection is  imaginary, 
the effect is real - so rea l ,  indeed, that i t  determines the very structure 
of the h igher animals . 1 5  It is for al l  the world as though the left side of 
the bodies of these animals were the reflection in a plane mi rror of the 
right, the result being a perfect reflectional symmetry; this is completed, 
moreover, by a rotational symmetry: the l i fe of the spinal column.

precise concept, according to Wey l :  'A body, a spat ia l  configuration, is  symmetric with 
respect to a given plane E i f  i t  i s  carried into itsel f by reflection in E. Take any l ine I 
perpendicular to E and any point p on /: there exists one and only one point p ' on I

pp. 4-5 ) .  

The interest and importance of the mirror derives not, therefore, from t h e  fact that i t  
projects the 'subject's' ( o r  Ego's) image back to  t h e  'subject' ( o r  Ego), b u t  rather from the 
fact that it extends a repetition (symmetry) immanent to the body into space. The Same

feel ,  smell and hear orle an"otner.·Then they contemplate one another 
with eye and gaze. One truly gets the impression that every shape in 
space, every spatial plane, constitutes a mirror and produces a m irage 
effect ; that within each body the rest of the world is reflected, and 
referred back to, in  an ever-renewed to-and-fro of  reciprocal reflection, 
an interplay of shifting colours, l ights and forms. A mere change of 
position, or a change in a place's surroundings, is enough to precipitate 
an object's passage into the l ight: what was covert becomes overt, what 
was cryptic becomes l impidly clear. A movement of the body may have 
a similar goal .  Here is the point of intersection of the two sensory fields. 

Were it not for this dual aspect and natural/social space, how could we 
understand language itself? 'Nature' can only be apprehended through 
objects and shapes, but this perception occurs within an overal l  context 
of i l lumination where bodies pass from thei r natural obscurity into the 
light, not in an arbi trary manner but according to a specific sequence, 
order or articulation. Where natural space exists, and even more so 
where socia l space exists, the movement from obscurity to enl ightenment 
- the process of decipherment - is perpetua l .  It is in fact part and parcel 
of the way in which the existence of space is established. Th is incessant 
deciphering activity is objective as much as subjective - in which respect 
it indeed transcends the old phi losophical distinction between objectiv i ty 
and subjectivity . It becomes more acute as soon as concealed parts of 
space ( the internal portions of th ings and things outside the field of 
perception) come to have associated with themselves symbols, or corre­
sponding signs or indices, which are often tabooed, holy/evi l ,  revelatory

of Maurice Merleau-Ponry, notab ly L'oeil et /'esprit ( Paris :  Ga l l imard , 1964), where he 
abandons a phenomenological accou111 of perception in  favour of a deeper ana lysis.  
Merleau-Ponry remained attached, however, to rhe phi losoph ica l categories of 'sub1ect' 
and 'object', which have no relation to social practice.

or occult. It is in this sense that it cannot be properly described as either 
a subjective or an objective, a conscious or an unconscious, activity ; 
rather, it is an activity which serves to generate consciousness : messages, 
by virtue of space and of the interplay of reflections and mirages within 
it, are intrinsic to l ived experience itself. 

Space - my space - is not the context of which I constitute the 
'textual ity ' :  instead, it is first of all my body, and then it  is my body's 
counterpart or 'other', its mirror- image or shadow: i t  is the shifting 
intersection between that which touches, penetrates, threatens or benefits 
my body on the one hand, and al l other bodies on the other. Thus 
we are concerned, once again, with gaps and tensions, contacts and 
separations. Yet, through and beyond these various effects of meaning, 
space is actual ly experienced, in its depths, as duplications, echoes and 
reverberations, redundancies and doubl ings-up which engender - and 
are engendered by - the strangest of contrasts: face and arse, eye and 
flesh, viscera and excrement, l ips and teeth, orifices and phallus, clenched 
fists and opened hands - as also clothed versus naked, open versus 
closed, obscenity versus famil iarity, and so on. 1 7  None of these oppo­
sitions and conjunctions/disjunctions has anyth ing to do with a logic or 
formal system. 

Should we therefore conclude that mirror and mirage effects exist  but 
that there is no such thing as an anti-mirror effect, a l ived experience 
of blank opacity ? Certainly not i f  we recal l  Tzara's description of mirrors 
as the ' fruits of dread', or Bataille's comparison of himself with a 
'tarnished mirror' .  Here, too, is Eluard :  'The reflection of the personal ity 
must be wiped away before inspiration can spring forth from the mir­
ror.' 1 8  The mirror is a surface at once pure and impure, almost material 

17  See the works of Octavio Paz, especial ly Conjimciones y disyunciones (Mexico City: 
Joaquin Mortiz, 1 969 ) ;  Eng. tr. by Helen R.  Lane: Conjunctiom and Disjunctions (New 
York: Viking, 1 974) .  Paz examines the body, the mirror, and a variety of dualisms and 
their dialectical interactions, in the l ight of poetry. He draws a distinction, and points up 
an antagonism, applicable to al l  societies, cultures or civil izations, berween the signs of 
'body' and the signs o f  'non-body' (see pp. 5 1 ,  58ff; Eng. tr., pp. 45, 52ff).  

1 • Oddly absent from Bachelard's La poetique de /'espace, mirrors he ld  a special fasci­
nation for the surrealists. One, Pierre Mabille, devoted a whole book to the subject. 
Cocteau gave mirrors an important role in both his poetic and his cinematographic works; 
i t  was in th is  connection that he invented the superstition of  the 'purely' visual. Consider 
too the immense part played by the mirror in every major tradition, whether popular or 
artistic. Cf. Jean-Louis Schefer, Scenographie d'un tableau (Paris: Seui l ,  1 969) .  

The psychoanalysts have made great p lay with the 'mirror effect' in  their attempts to 
demolish the phi losophical 'subject'. Indeed they have gone far too far in this d i rection, 
for they consider the mirror effect only out of its properly spatial context, as part of  a 
space internal ized in the form of mental 'topologies' and agencies. As for the generalization 
of the 'mi rror effect' into a theory of  ideologies, see Louis Althusser's article in  La Pemee,

yet virtual ly unreal ;  it presents the Ego with its own material presence, 
ca l l ing up its counterpart, its absence from - and at the same time its 
inherence in - this 'other' space. Inasmuch as its symmetry is projected 
therein, the Ego is l iable to ' recognize' itself in the 'other' ,  but it does 
not in fact coincide with i t :  'other' merely represents 'Ego' as an inverted 
image in which the left appears at the right, as a reflection which yet 
generates an extreme difference, as a repetition which transforms the 
Ego's body into an obsessing will-o'-the-wisp . Here what is identical is 
at the same time radically other, radica l ly  different - and transparency 
is equivalent to opacity .

If my body may be said to enshrine a generative principle, at once 
abstract and concrete, the mirror's surface makes this principle invisible, 
deciphers it .  The mirror discloses the relationship between me and 
myself, my body and the consciousness of my body - not because the 
reflection constitutes my unity qua subject, as many psychoanalysts and 
psychologists apparently believe, but because i t  transforms what I am 
into the sign of what I am. This ice-smooth barrier, itsel f merely an 
inert sheen, reproduces and displays what I am - in a word, signifies 
what I am - within an imaginary sphere which is yet quite real .  A 
process of abstraction then - but a fascinating abstraction.  In order to 
know myself, I 'separate myself  out from myself' . 1 9  The effect is dizzying. 
Should the 'Ego' fai l  to reassert hegemony over itself by defying its own 
image, i t  must become Narcissus - or Alice. It will then be in danger 
of never rediscovering itself, space qua figment will have swal lowed it 
up, and the glacial surface of the mirror wil l  hold it forever captive in 
its emptiness, i n  an absence devoid of all conceivable presence or bodily 
warmth. The mirror thus presents or offers the most unifying but also 

June 1 970, p.  35 .  This i s  the product of a fantasy, and of a half-conscious wish to preserve 
dogmatic Marxism. 

' 9  In h i s  Le systeme des obiets ( Paris :  Gal l imard, 1 968 ) ,  Jean Baudri l lard sees the mi rror 
as nothing more, for the bourgeois, than an extension of 'h is '  drawing-room or bedroom. 
This is to l imi t  rhe m irror's real  significance, and in  effect to abol ish the (psychoanalyric) 
notion of narcissism. The ambigu ity (or dual ity) of  these phenomena, along with their 
inherent complexity, emerges clearly from the analyses of Jacques Lacan (cf. 'his account 
of the mirror stage in "La Famille', Encydopedie fran,aise, Vol . VI I I :  Henri Wal lon, ed., 
La vie mentale, Pa ris, 1 938 ) ,  bur Lacan does nor provide much in rhe way of elucidation. 
For him the mirror helps to coumeract the tendency of l anguage to break up the body 
into pieces, but i t  freezes rhe Ego into a rigid form rather than leading ii towards 
transcendence in and through a space which is at once practical and symbolic ( imaginary) .  



1 86 SPATIAL ARCH ITECTO N I C S  

the most dis junctive relationship between form and content: forms 
therein have a powerful real ity yet remain unrea l ;  they readi ly expel or 
contain their contents, yet these contents retain an irreducible force, an 
irreducible opacity, and this is as true for my body (the content of 'my 
consciousness ' )  as for other bodies, for bodies in general .  So many 
objects have this dual character :  they are transitional inasmuch as they 
tend towards something else, yet they are also aims or 'objectives' in 
their own right .  Among al l  such objects, the mirror undoubtedly has a 
specia l  place. Al l  the same, to argue (as some overzealous proponents 
of psychoanalysis do) that al l  property can be defined in terms of a kind 
of mirror effect, on the grounds that possess ion of an object by the 
'Ego' makes that object the Ego's own is to overstep the bounds that 
'culture' places on stupidity in genera l .  

There is in fact l i ttle justification for any systematic generalization 
from the effects of this particular object, whose role is properly confined 
to a sphere within the immediate vicinity of the body. 

The mirror is thus at once an object among others and an object 
different from all others, evanescent, fascinating. In and through the 
mirror, the traits of other objects in relationship to their spatial envi ron­
ment are brought together; the mirror is an object in space which 
informs us about space, which speaks of space. In some ways a kind of 
'picture', the mirror too has a frame which specifies it, a frame that can 
be either empty or fil led. Into that space which is produced first by 
natural and later by social l i fe the mirror introduces a truly dual spatial­
ity : a space which is imaginary with respect to origin and separation, 
but also concrete and practical with respect to coexistence and differen­
tiation. Many phi losophers - and non-phi losophers, such as Len in -
have sought to define thought in terms of a mi rror effect, in terms of 
reflection. But in so doing they confuse act and symbol. Prior to its 
practical rea lization, to its material manufacture, the mirror already 
existed in magical or mythic modes : the surface of water symbolizes 
the surface of consciousness and the materia l (concrete) process of 
decipherment which brings what is obscure forth into the light. 

For our present purposes, we need to consider and elaborate upon a 
number of rel ationships usually treated as 'psych ic' ( i .e .  rel ating to the 
psyche) .  We shall treat them, however, as material, because they arise 
in connection with the (material) body/subject and the (material) 
mirror/object; at  the same time we shall look upon them as particular 
instances of a 'deeper' and more general relationship which we shall be 
coming back to later in our discussion - that between repetition and 
differentiation. The relationships in question are the following. 



SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTONICS 1 87  
1 Symmetry (p lanes and axes ) :  duplication, reflection - also asym­

metry as correlated with symmetry . 
2 Mirages and mirage effects : reflections, surface versus depth, the 

revealed versus the concealed, the opaque versus the transparent. 
3 Language as ' reflection' ,  with its famil iar pairs of opposites: 

connoting versus connoted, or what confers value versus what 
has value conferred upon it ;  and refraction through discourse. 

4 Consciousness of oneself and of the other, of the body and of the 
abstract realm of otherness and of becoming-other (alienation) . 

5 Time, the immediate (directly experienced, hence blind and 
'unconscious' )  l ink between repetition and differentiation. 

6 Lastly, space, with its double determinants: imaginary/real, 
produced/producing, material/socia l ,  immediate/mediated 
(mi lieu/transition) ,  connection/separation, and so on. 

Only late on was the realm of symbols and signs integrated into the 
larger realm of shadows. Bearers of a clarity at once auspicious and i l l ­
starred, symbols and signs were at first cryptic in character (but in  a 
material sense ) ;  concealed in  grottoes or caves, they sometimes caused 
these places to be cursed, sometimes to become holy, as sanctuaries or 
temples. The truth of signs and the signs of truth are contained within 
the same enigma:  the enigma of the ltaliot and Roman mundus - the 
hole, the bottomless pit. The enigma, too, of the Christian rel iquaries -
those underground churches or chapels so aptly named 'crypts ' .  And 
the enigma, final ly, of an opaque body - or opaque bodies - whence 
truth emerges in  stunning clarity : the body that brings l ight into the 
darkness . 

Of the relationship between the sexes (which is in no sense a special 
case) ,  may not comparable things be said ? 

1 Here too we find symmetry (and asymmetry ) :  male and female. 
2 Here too we find displaced i l lusional effects { transparency versus 

opacity ) .  The other emerges and turns out to be the same, a lbeit 
in  an ambiguous and shadowy manner: the same desire as fai ls 
to recognize itsel f as such. A fragmentation ensues and, thanks 
to the osci l lation between knowing and misapprehending, a will 
{to power) is  able to intrude itself. 

3 This fragmentation of desire, heralding the explosive fragmen­
tation of pleasure, natura l ly leads to a separation, but this in 
no way el iminates 'reflection' ( in the sense of that rel ationship 
between self and other in which each person seeks h imself in 



1 8 8  SPATI A L  ARCH ITECrONICS 
hopes of finding the other, wh i le what he seeks in the other is 
a projection of h imself) . 

4 Hence the great nostalgia we feel about an absolu te love which 
always leads us back to a rela tive one, a 'pure' love which 
always disappoints, which is i nconceivable apart from a flesh 
that reverses the original  tendency and releases the original 
tension, and replaces them with a fu lfi lment that is no less 
disappointing for being more a ttainable. A nosta lgia ,  then, that 
contains dissent - and resentment. The imaginary plane of the 
mirror is here too - the divider between two mirror images or 
doubles : to perceive oneself in th is space is to meld one's features 
with those of the counterpart. 

It goes without saying that no ' theory of doubles' would stop here, 
a l though this line of  thought would certa inly constitute the initial focus 
of any such theory of reflections and mirages . I t  would have to be 
extended, for one thing, to take in theatrical space, with its interplay 
between fictitious and rea l counterparts and its interaction between 
gazes and mirages in which actor, audience, 'characters' ,  text, and 
author al l  come together but never become one. By means of such 
theatrical interplay bodies are able to pass from a 'rea l ' ,  immediately 
experienced space ( the pit, the stage) to a perceived space - a third 
space which is no longer either scenic or publ ic. At once fictitious and 
rea l ,  this th ird space is classical theatrical space. 

To the question of  whether such a space is a representation of space 
or a representational space, the answer must be neither - and both . 
Theatrical space certainly implies a representation of space - scenic 
space - corresponding to a particular conception of space (that of 
the classical drama, say - or the Elizabethan, or the Ital ian ) .  The 
representational space, mediated yet directly experienced, which infuses 
the work and the moment, is  established as such through the dramatic 
action itself.

Identifying the foundations upon which the space of each particu lar 
society is bui lt ,  the underpinnings of that space's gradual development, 
i s  only the beginning of any exploration of a rea l ity that to begin with 
seems transparently clear. Thus representations of space, which confuse 



SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO N I CS 1 89 
matters precisely because they offer an already clarified picture, must 
be dispel led. 

The mirage effects whose preconditions I have tried to establish 
( though not to elaborate upon ) in the foregoing d iscussion can be 
extraordinary - more specifically, they can introduce an extraordinary 
element into an  ordinary context. They cannot be reduced solely to the 
surprise of the Ego contemplating itself in the glass, and either dis­
covering itsel f or sl ipping into narcissism. The power of a landscape 
does not derive from the fact that it offers itse lf  as a spectacle, but 
rather from the fact that, as mirror and mirage, it presents any suscep­
tible viewer with an image at once true and false of a creative capacity 
which the subject (or Ego) is able, during a moment of marvellous self­
deception, to claim as his own. A landscape also has the seductive power 
of  all pictures, and this is especial ly true of an urban landscape - Venice, 
for example - that can impose itsel f immediately as a work . Whence 
the archetypal  touristic delusion of being a participant in such a work, 
and of understanding it completely, even though the tourist merely 
passes through a country or countryside and absorbs its image in a quite 
passive way. The work in  its concrete reality, its products, and the 
productive activity involved are all thus obscured and indeed consigned 
to oblivion . 

Mirage effects have far-ranging consequences. Under the conditions 
of modernity ,  as absolute political space extends its sway, the impression 
of transparency becomes stronger and stronger, and the i l lusion of a 
new l i fe is everywhere reinforced. Real l ife indeed appears quite close 
to us. We fee l  able, from with i n  everyday l ife, to reach out and grasp 
it, as though nothing lay between us and the marvellous rea l ity on the 
other side of  the mirror. All the prerequ isites for it exist - so what is 
missing? An utterance of some kind, spoken or written ? A gesture ? A 
successfu l  attack on some particular aspect of things, or the removal of 
some particular obstacle - ideology perhaps, or established knowledge, 
or some repressive institution or other, or rel igion ,  or theatrical i ty, or 
the educational system, or the spectacle ? The list is endless. 

The idea of a new l i fe is  at  once real istic and i l lusory - and hence 
neither true nor false. What is true is that the preconditions for a 
different l ife have a lready been created, and that that other l i fe is thus 
on the cards. What is false is the assumption that being on the cards 
and being imminent are the same thing, that what is  immediately possible 
is necessarily a world away from what is only a distant possibi l ity, or 
even an impossibi l ity .  The fact is that the space which contains the 
rea l ized preconditions of another l ife is the same one as prohibits what 



1 90 SPATIAL ARCH ITECTO N I CS 
those preconditions make possible. The seeming l impidity of that space 
is therefore a delusion : it appears to make elucidation unnecessary, but 
in reality i t  urgently requires elucidation . A total revolution - material ,  
economic, social ,  political, psychic, cultural, erotic, etc. - seems to  be 
in the offing, as though already immanent to the present. To change 
l i fe, however, we must first change space. Absolute revolution is our 
sel f- image and our mirage - as seen through the mirror of absolute 
(politica l )  space. 

VII 

A social space is not a socialized space.20 The would-be general theory 
of the 'social ization' of whatever precedes society - i .e .  nature, biology, 
physiology (needs, 'physica l '  l ife) ,  and so on - is real ly j ust the basic 
tenet of an ideology. It is a lso a 'reactive' mirage effect .  To hold, for 
example, that natural space, the space described by the geographer, 
existed as such and was then at some point social ized leads either to 
the ideological posture of nostalgic regret for a space that is no longer, 
or else to the equal ly ideological view that this space is of no consequence 
because it is disappearing. In reality, whenever a society undergoes a 
transformation, the materia ls used in the process derive from another, 
h istorically (or developmental ly)  anterior social practice. A purely natu­
ral or original state of affairs is nowhere to be found. Hence the 
notoriously difficult problems encountered by (phi losophical ) thinking 
on the subject of origins. The notion of  a space which is at first empty, 
but is later fi l led by a social l i fe and modified by it, also depends on 
this hypothetical init ial 'purity', identified as 'nature' and as a sort of 
ground zero of human real ity. Empty space in  the sense of a mental and 
socia l  void which facil itates the social ization of a not-yet-social realm 
is  actual ly merely a representation of space. Space is conceived of as 
being transformed into ' l ived experience' by a social 'subject', and is 
governed by determinants which may be practical (work, play) or bio­
socia l  (young people, children, women, active people) in character. This 
representation subtends the notion of a space in which the ' interested 
parties ' ,  individuals or groups, supposedly dwell and have their being. 
Of any actua l  h istorica l ly generated space, however, it would be more 

20 Pace Georges Maron:, whose L 'espace lmmain (Paris :  La Colombe, 1 962) ,  though 
one of the best discussions of semantics and spatial metaphors, is l im ited in its significance 
because of the author's espousal of this erroneous thesis. 



SPATI A L  A RCH ITECTO N I CS 1 9 1  
accurate t o  say that i t  played a social izing role (by means o f  a multiplicity 
of networks) than that it was itself socia l ized. 

Can the space of work, for example (when indeed it is legitimate to 
speak of such a space ) ,  be envisaged as a void occupied by an entity 
cal led work ? Clearly not: i t  is produced within the framework of a global 
society,  and in  accordance with that society's constitutive production 
relations. In capitalist society, the spwe of work consists of production 
units : businesses, farms, offices. The arious networks which link these 
units are also part of the space of w rk. As for the agencies that govern 
these networks, they are not identic I to those that govern work itself, 
but they are articulated with them in a rel atively coherent manner which 
does not, however, exclude conflicts and contradictions. The space of 
work is thus the result , in the first place, of the ( repetitive) gestures and 
(seria l )  actions of productive labour, but also - and increasingly - of 
the ( technical and socia l )  divis ion of labour ;  the result therefore, too, 
of the operation of markets ( local, national and worldwide) and, lastly, 
of property relationships (the ownership and management of the means 
of production ) .  Which is to say that the space of work has contours 
and boundaries only for and through a thought which abstracts ; as one 
network a mong others, as one space among many interpenetrating 
spaces, its existence is strictly relative. 

Social space can never escape its basic dual ity ,  even though triadic 
determining factors may sometimes override and incorporate its binary 
or dual  nature, for the way in which it presents itself and the way in 
which i t  is represented are different. Is not social space always, and 
simultaneously, both a field of action (offering its extension to the 
deployment of projects and practical intentions) and a basis of action 
(a set of places whence energies derive and whither energies are directed) ?  
Is it not a t  once actual (given ) and potential ( locus o f  possibil ities ) ? Is 
it not at once quantitative (measurable by means of  units of 
measurement)  and qualitative (as concrete extension where unreplen­
ished energies run out, where distance is measured in  terms of fatigue 
or in terms of time needed for activity ) ? And is it not at once a collection 
of materials (objects, things) and an ensemble of materiel ( tools - and 
the procedures necessary to make efficient use of tools  and of things in  
general ) ?  

Space appears a s  a rea lm o f  objectivity, yet i t  exists i n  a social sense 
only for activity - for (and by virtue of) walking or riding on horseback, 
or travell ing by car, boat, train, plane, or some other means. In one 
sense, then, space proposes homologous paths to choose from, while in 
another sense it invests particular paths with specia l  value. The same 



1 92 SPATI A L  ARCH ITECrO N I CS 
goes for angles and turns: what is to the left may also be s inister; what 
is to the right may also be ' right' in  the sense of rectitude. A would­
be homogeneous space, open to whatever actions may be reasonable, 
authorized or ordered, can, under its other aspect, take responsib i l i ty 
for prohibi tions, embody occu lt traits and bestow favour or disfavour 
upon individuals and the groups to which they belong. Loca l ization is 
answered by divergence, and focus on a central point is answered by 
radiation, by influx and d iffusion. Like energy in  a material form such 
as a molecule or an atom, socia l  energy is both d irected and dispersed ; 
it becomes concentrated in a certain place, yet continues to act upon 
the sphere outside. This means that social spaces have foundations that 
are at once materia l  and formal, including concentricity and grids, 
straight l i nes and curves - all the modal i ties of demarcation and orien­
tation. Socia l  spaces cannot be defined, however, by reducing them to 
their basic dual ism ; rather, this dualism supplies the materials for the 
realization of a very great variety of projects. In  natural or ( l ater) 
'geographica l '  space, routes were inscribed by means of simple l inear 
markings. Ways and tracks were pores which, without col l iding, gradu­
al ly widened and lengthened, leading to the establ ishment of places 
(way-stations, localities made specia l  for one reason or another) and 
boundaries. Through these pores, which accentuated local particularities 
by making use of them, flowed increasingly dense human streams:  s imple 
herding, the seasonal movement of flocks, migrations of masses of 
people, and so on.  

These activities and spatio-tempora l determinants may be sa id to 
belong to the anthropological stage of socia l  real i ty. We have defined 
this stage as the stage of demarcation and orientation. Dominant i n  
archaic and  agricultural-pastoral societies, these later became recessive 
and subordinate activ ities .  There is no stage, however, at which 'man' 
does not demarcate, beacon or sign his  space, leaving traces that are 
both symbolic and practica l ;  changes of direction and turns in th is space 
a lways need to be represented, and 'he' meets this figurative need ei ther 
by taking his own body as a centre or by reference to other bodies 
( celestial bodies, for example, the angle of  incidence of whose l ight 
serves to refine the human perception of angles in genera l ) .  

It should not  be  supposed that 'primitive' people - seasonal ly migrant 
herders, let us say - formed abstract representations of straight and 
curved l ines, of obtuse and acute angles, or - even virtua l ly - of 
measures. Their indicators remained purely qualitative in  character, l ike 
those of animals .  Different d irections appeared as either benevolent or i l l ­
omened. The indicators themselves were objects invested with a ffective 



SPAT I A L  ARCH ITECTO NICS 1 93 

sign ificance - what wou ld later be cal led 'symbolic' objects. Egregious 
aspects of the terra in were associated perhaps with a memory, perhaps 
with particular actions which they faci l i tated . The networks of paths 
and roads made up a space just as concrete as that of the body - of 
which they were in fact an extension. Directions in space and time were 
inhabited for such a herder - and how could i t  be otherwise ? - by real 
and fictitious, dangerous or lucky 'creatures ' .  Thus qual ified, symboli­
cal ly or  p ractical ly, this space bore along the myths and stories attached 
to it. The concrete space constituted by such networks and frontiers had 
more in common with a spider's web than with geometrical space. We 
have a l ready noted that calculation has to reconstruct in a complicated 
way what 'nature' produces in the l iv ing body and its extensions. We 
also know that symbolism and praxis cannot be separated. 

The relationships establ ished by boundaries are certainly of the great­
est importance here, a long with the rela tionship between boundaries 
and named places ; thus the most sign ificant features of a shepherd's 
space might include the place (often enclosed) where he gathers his 
sheep, the spring where he waters them, the bounds of the pasture 
avai lable to him, and his neighbours' land, which is off l imits .  Every 
social space, then, once duly demarcated and oriented, implies a superim­
position of certa in relations upon networks of named p laces, of lieux­
dits. This resu l ts in various kinds of space. 

Accessible space for normal use : routes fol lowed by riders or 
flocks, ways leading to fields, and so on. Such use is governed 
prescriptively - by establ ished rules and practical procedures . 

2 Boundaries and forbidden territories - spaces to which access 
is prohibi ted either relative ly (neighbours and friends) or absol­
utely (neighbours and enemies ) .  

3 Places of abode, whether permanent or temporary. 
4 Junction points : these are often places of passage and encounter; 

often, too, access to them is forbidden except on certain 
occasions of ritual import - declarations of war or peace, for 
example. 

Boundaries and junction points (which are also, in the nature of things, 
points of friction) will natural ly have different aspects according to the 
type of society, according to whether we are considering relatively settled 
peasants, plundering warriors, or true nomads or herders given to 
seasonal migrations. 

Socia l  space do.es incorporate one three-dimensional aspect, inherited

from nature, namely the fact that between what is above (mountains, 
h ighlands, celestial beings) and what is below ( in grottoes or caves) l ie 
the surfaces of the sea and of the earth 's flatlands, which thus constitute 
p lanes (or plains)  that serve both to separate and to unite the heights 
and the depths. Here is the basis of representations of the Cosmos. 
S imi larly, caves, grottoes, h idden and underground places provide the 
starting-point for representations of the world and myths of the earth­
as-mother. As perceived by our shepherd, however, such oppositions as 
those between west and east, north and south, high and low, or before 
and behind have nothing to do with abstract ideas. Rather, they are at  
once relationships and qual ities. Space thus qualifies in  terms of time, 
in terms of i l l -defined measures (paces, degree of fatigue) ,  or in terms of 
parts of  the body (cubits, inches, feet, palms, etc. ) .  Through displacement 
outwards from the centre, the body of the thinking and acting subject 
is replaced by a social object such as a ch ief's hut, a pole or, later, a 
temple or church . The 'primitive' situates or speaks of space as a member 
of a collectivity which itself occupies a regulated space closely bound 
up with time. He does not envisage h imself in space as one point among 
others in an abstract milieu. That is a type of perception belonging to 
a much later period, and is contemporaneous with the space of 'plans' 
and maps.

The body serves both as point of departure and as destination. We have 
a lready encountered this body - our body - many times in the present 
discussion. But what body, precisely, are we talking about ?  

Bodies resemble each other, bu t  the  differences between them are 
more striking than the similarities. What is there in common between 
the body of a peasant leading his working ox, shackled to the soil by 
his plough, and the body of a splendid knight on his charger or show 
horse ? These two bodies are as differen t  as those of the bul lock and the 
entire horse in whose company we find them ! In either case, the animal 
intervenes as medium (means, instrument or intermediary) between man 
and space. The difference between the 'media' implies an analogous 
difference between the two spaces in question. In short, a wheatfield is 
a world away from a battlefield. 

But what conception of the body are we to adopt or readopt, discover 
or rediscover, as our point of departure ? Plato's?  Aquinas's ? The body 
that sustains the intellectus or the body that sustains the habitus ? The 



SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO NICS 1 95 

body as glorious or the body as wretched ? Descartes 's body-as-object, or 
the body-as-subject of phenomenology and existential ism ? A fragmented 
body, represented by images, by words, and traded retai l ? Must we start 
out from a discourse on the body ? If so, how are we to avoid the deadly 
tendency of  discourse towards abstraction ? And, if  indeed we must 
begin from an abstraction, how can we limit its impact, or go beyond 
its l imitations ?  

Should we  perhaps rather take off from the 'social body' - a body 
battered and broken by a devastating practice, namely the division of 
labour, and by the weight of society 's  demands ? But how can we expect 
to define a critical space if  we start out by accepting a body inserted 
into this a l ready 'socia l '  space - and mutilated by it? On the other hand, 
what basis do we have - and indeed what means - for defining this 
body in itself, without ideology ? 

When the body came up earlier on in our analysis, it did not present 
itse l f  either as subject or as object in the phi losophical sense, nor as an 
internal mi lieu standing in opposition to an external one, nor as a 
neutral space, nor as a mechanism occupying space partia l ly or frag­
mentarily. Rather, it appeared as a 'spatial body' .  A body so conceived, 
as produced and as the production of a space, is immediately subject to 
the determinants of that space : symmetries, interactions and reciprocal 
actions, axes and planes, centres and peripheries, and concrete (spatio­
temporal )  oppositions. The materia l ity of this body is attributable neither 
to a consolidation of parts of  space into an apparatus, nor to a nature 
unaffected by space which is yet somehow able to distribute itself 
through space and so occupy it . Rather, the spatial body's material 
character derives from space, from the energy that is deployed and put 
to use there. 

Considered as a 'machine' , the spatial body is two-sided : one side is 
run by massive supplies of energy ( from al imentary and metabolic 
sources) ,  the other side by refined and minute energies (sense data ) .  The 
question arises whether such a ' two-sided machine' is a machine at a l l .  
To treat it as such must  at the very least introduce a dialectical element 
into - and hence concretize - the Cartesian  concept of 'machine', a 
concept which is not only highly abstract but a lso embedded in a very 
abstractly conceived representation of space. The notion of a two-sided 
machine natural ly impl ies interaction within its bipartite structure. It 
embraces the possibi l i ty of u npredictable effects, and rejects all strict 
mechanism, all hard-and-fast and uni lateral definition. This machine's 
devices for the emission and reception of small-scale energies l ie in the 
sensory organs, the afferent and efferent nerve pathways, and the brain .  



1 96 SPATI A L  ARCH ITECfO N I CS 

The organs of massive-energy use are the muscles, and above a l l  the 
sexual  organs, which are the pole where such energy accumulates explo­
sively. The body's organic constitution is itse lf di rectly l inked to the 
body's spatial constitution (or organ ization) .  How could the tendencies 
in trinsic to this whole - the tendency to capture, withhold and accumu­
late energy on the one hand, and the tendency to discharge it suddenly 
on the other - fai l  to have a conflictual relationship ? The same goes for 
the coexisting tendencies to explore space and to invade it. The conflicts 
inherent in the spatio-temporal real ity of this body - which is neither 
substance, nor entity, nor mechanism, nor flux, nor closed system -
culminate in the antagonisms in human beings between knowledge and 
action, head and genitals, and desires and needs . As for which of these 
conflicts is the most or least significant, that is a value-based question 
which is  meaningless un less one posits a hierarchy. There is no sense in 
doing so, however - or, rather, doing so is a way of los ing the sense of 
the matter. For the notion of h ierarchy can only lead us into the realm 
of  the Western Logos, into the Judaeo-Christian tradition. The conflicts 
in question, though, do not depend solely on language, on fractured 
words, fractured images or fractured places. They flow also - and indeed 
primari ly - from an opposition constitutive of the l iv ing organism as a 
dialectical total ity: the fact that in this organism the pole of small-scale 
energy (brain, nerves, senses) does not necessarily concord, in fact rather 
the opposite, with the massive-energy pole (sexual apparatus ) .  The l iving 
organism has neither meaning nor existence when considered in isolation 
from its extensions, from the space that it reaches and produces (i .e. its 
'mi l ieu ' - to use a fashionable term that tends to reduce activity to the 
level of mere passive insertion into a natural material rea lm) .  Every such 
organism is reflected and refracted in the changes that it wreaks in its 
'mi l ieu' or 'environment' - in  other words, in its space. 

At times the body, which we have yet to explore, gets covered up, 
concealed from view, but then it re-emerges - then it is as it were 
resuscitated. Does this suggest a connection between the history of the 
body and the history of space ? 

With its warts plainly visible, but also its strengths and triumphs, the 
body as here conceived is not susceptible to the simple (and in fact 
crude and ideological )  d istinction between normal and abnormal states, 
between health and pathology. In what is conventional ly referred to as 
'natu re' , where the fundamental rule is fert i l ization, is  any discrimination 
made between pleasure and pain ? Not in any obvious way, certainly. 
One is tempted to say, rather, that such a distinction is in fact the work 
- the great work even - of humanity, a work often diverted and 



SPATI AL A R C H ITECl"O N I CS 1 97 

misdirected, but one which enl i sts the contributions of learning and art. 
A heavy price attaches, however, to the attainment of this goal , for, 
once effected, this disassociation entails the separation of things that 
cannot or must not be separated. 

Let us return, however, to our inventory of what the body has to 
give. Tangible space possesses (a lthough these words are not ideal here) 
a basis or foundation, a ground or background, in the olfactory realm. 
I f  sensual rapture and i ts  antithesis exist  anywhere, i f  there i s  any sphere 
where, as a phi losopher might say, an intimacy occurs between 'subject' 
and 'object', it must surely be the world of smells and the places where 
they reside. 

Next step, in they're plunged into some rot, some stump of dwarf 
birch, bark rubbed ass of raw by tail of bear or moose of caribou 
antlers eigh t  years ago ! . Into the open mouth of that remain ing 
stump came the years of snow, sun, l itt le jewels of bird shit, cries 
of sap from the long dying roots, the monomaniacal yodel ing of 
insects, and wood rotting into rotting wood, into gestures of wood, 
into powder and punk all wet and stinking with fracture between 
earth and sky, yeah, D. J. could smell the break, gangrene in  the 
wood, electric rot cleaner than meat and shit sick smell and red­
hot blood of  your blood in  putrefaction, but a confirmed wood 
gangrene nonetheless, Burbank, a chaos of odor on the banks of 
the wound, noth ing smells worse than half-l i fe, l i fe which has no 
l i fe but don 't know it  - thank you, Mr. Phi losopher . .  ! 2 1 

Such overwhelming and vi l lainous smells are made up for in nature by 
their counterparts, by aromas and fragrances of a l l  kinds, by the m iracu­
lous scents of flowers and by the odours of the flesh . It may be asked 
whether there is any point in dwell ing on this space, which is in any 
case fast disappearing under the current onslaught of hygiene and asep­
ticism. I s  Hall perhaps right to assert that these are strictly anthropologi­
cal or 'cultural ly' determined phenomena ? Should the d istaste unques­
' tionably felt by some 'modern' people for natural odours be dismissed 
as the cause, or perhaps the effect, of the detergent industry ? The 
search for answers to such questions may as well be left to the cultural 
anthropologists. For our purposes, the pertinent fact is that everywhere 
in the modern world smells are being el iminated . What is  shown by thi s  

2 1  Norman Mai ler, Why Are We m Vietnam ? ( 1 967; New York : Holt, Rinehart and 
Winston, 1 982) ,  p. 1 39. 



1 98 SPATI A L  A R C H ITECTO N ICS 
immense deodorizing campaign, which makes use of every avai lable 
means to combat natural smells whether good or bad, is  that the 
transposition of  everything into the idiom of images , of spectacle, of  
verbal discourse, and of  writing and reading i s  but one aspect of a much 
vaster enterprise. Anyone who is wont (and every chi ld fa l ls  immediately 
into this category) to identify p laces, people and th ings by their smells 
is unl ikely to be very susceptible to rhetoric. Transitional objects to 
which desire becomes attached in seeking to escape subjectivity and 
reach out to 'the other' are founded primarily on the olfactory sense ; 
this is true also for the erotic object in general .  

Smells are not  decodable. Nor  can they be  inventoried, for no inven­
tory of them can have either a beginning or an end. They ' inform' only 
about the most fundamental real ities, about l i fe and death, and they are 
part of no significant dichotomies except perhaps that between l i fe 
beginning and l ife ending. There is no pathway here other than the 
direct one between the receiving centre and the perimeter of its range -
no pathway other than the nose and the scent themselves. Somewhere 
between information and the direct stimulation of a brutal response, the 
sense of smell had its glory days when animal i ty still predominated over 
'culture', rational ity and education - before these factors, combined 
with a thoroughly cleansed space, brought about the complete atrophy 
of smel l .  One can't help fee l ing, though, that to carry around an atro­
phied organ which sti l l  claims its due must be somewhat pathogenic. 

The rose of Angelus Silesius, which does not know that it is a flower, 
nor that  it is  beautifu l ,  is  also ignorant of the fact that it exudes a 
delightfu l  scent. Though already threatened with extinction by the fruit, 
i t  unhesitatingly proffers its transient splendour. This act of sel f-display 
corresponds, however, to an 'unconscious' nature, stri ving and intent -
to the interplay of l ife and death . Odours, which bespeak natu re's 
violence and largesse, do not signify ;  they are, and they say what they 
are in a l l  its immediacy :  the intense particularity of what occupies a 
certain space and spreads outwards from that space into the surround­
ings. Nature's smells, be they fou l  or fragrant, are expressive. Industrial 
production, which often smells bad, also produces 'perfumes ' ;  the aim 
is that these should be 'signifiers' ,  and to this end words - advertising 
copy - l ink 'signifieds' to them: woman, freshness, nature, glamour, and 
so forth . But a perfume either induces or fai ls  to induce an erotic mood 
- it does not carry on a discourse about it .  I t  either fills a place with 
enchantment or else has no effect upon it at a l l .  

Tastes are hard to distinguish both from smel l s  and from the tactile 
sensations of  lips and tongue. They do differ from smells, however, in 
that they tend to form pairs of opposi tes : sweet versus bitter, salty 



SPATI A L  A R C H ITECTO N I CS 1 9 9  

versus sugary, and s o  on. They are thus susceptible o f  coding, and o f  
being produced according to a particular code ; witness the way a 
cookery book can lay down practical rules for their creation. At the 
same time, tastes cannot constitu te messages and their subjection to 
coding adds a determination that they do not possess in themselves. 
Sweet does not contain a reference to bi cter, the elusive charm of the 
bittersweet notwithstanding. Sweet is opposed to sour as wel l as to 
bitter, a lthough sourness and bitterness are not the same thing. Here it 
is socia l  practice that separates what in nature is given together ;  this is 
a practice which seeks to produce pleasure. Opposing tastes only come 
into their own when they occur in conjunction with other attributes : 
cold and hot, crispy and soft, smooth and rough - attributes related to 
the sense of touch . Thus from that social practice known as 'cookery' ,  
from the arts of heating, chi l l ing, boi l ing, preserving and roasting, there 
emerges a rea l i ty invested with a meaning which may properly be 
called 'human' - even though humanism ra rely al l udes to it; traditional 
humanism, l ike its modern opposi te, sets l i ttle store by pleasure, both 
being content to remain on the level of words. Meanwhile, at the body's 
centre is a kernel resistant to such efforts to reduce it, a 'something' 
which is not truly differential but which is nevertheless neither irrelevant 
nor completely undifferentiated: it is with in this primitive space that the 
int imate link persists between smells and tastes. 

A phi losopher might speak eloquently in this connection of a coexten­
sive presence of space and Ego thanks to che mediation of the body, 
but in fact a good deal more - and indeed something quite different -
is involved here. For the spatia l  body, becoming social does not mean 
being inserted into some pre-existing 'world ' :  this body produces and 
reproduces - and it perceives what it reproduces or produces. Its spatial 
properties and determinants are contained within it . In what sense, then, 
does i t  perceive them ? In the practico-sensory realm, the perception of 
right and left must be projected and imprinted into or onto things. Pa irs 
of determinants - axes versus points of a compass, direction versus 
orientation, symmetry versus asymmetry - must be introduced into 
space, which is to say, produced in space. The preconditions and prin­
ciples of the la teral ization of space l ie within the body, yet this must 
sti l l  be effected in such a way that right and left or up and down are 
indicated or marked - and choices thus offered to gesture and action .  

According to  Tomatis,21 the  hearing plays a decisive role in the 
latera l ization of perceived space. Space is l istened for, in fact, as much 

22 Alfred Ange Tomatis is  a wel l -known authority on hearing, the inventor of a mechan· 
ica l  (electronic) ear, and the author of many comributions to orthophonics. 



200 SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO N I CS 

as seen,  and heard before it comes into view. The perceptions of one 
ear differ from those of the other. This di fference puts the chi ld on alert, 
and lends volume and physical density to the messages it receives. The 
hearing thus plays a mediating role between the spatial body and the 
loca l ization of bodies outside it . The organic space of the ear, which is 
brought into being through the ch i ld's relationship with its mother, is 
thus extended to sounds from beyond the sphere of that relationship -
to other people's voices, for example. Hearing-disturbances, l ikewise, 
are accompanied by disturbances in lateralization in the perception of 
both external and internal space (dyslexias, etc. ) .  

A homogeneous and utterly simultaneous space would b e  strictly 
imperceptible. It would lack the confl ictual component (a lways resolved, 
but a lways at least suggested) of the contrast between symmetry and 
asymmetry. It may as well be noted at this j uncture that the architectural 
and urbanistic space of  modernity tends precisely towards this homo­
geneous state of a ffairs, towards a place of confusion and fusion between 
geometrical and visual which inspires a kind of physical discomfort. 
Everything is a l ike .  Localization - and lateralization - are no more. 
Signifier and signified, marks and markers, are added a fter the fact -
as decorations, so to speak .  This reinforces, if possible, the feeling of  
desertedness, and adds to  the  malaise. 

This modern space has an analogical a ffinity with the space of the 
phi losophical, and more specifically the Cartesian tradition .  Unfortu­
nately it is also the space of blank sheets of paper, drawing-boards, 
plans, sections, elevations, scale models, geometrical projections, and 
the l ike. Substituting a verbal ,  semantic or semiological space for such 
a space only aggravates its shortcomings. A narrow and desiccated 
rational ity of  this kind overlooks the core and foundation of space, the 
total body, the brain, gestures, and so forth . It forgets that space does 
not consist in the projection of an intellectual representation, does not 
arise from the visible-readable realm, but that it is first of al l  heard 
( l istened to) and enacted ( through physical gestures and movements) .  

A theory of information that assimilates the brain to an apparatus 
for receiving messages puts that organ 's particular physiology, and its 
particular  role in the body, in brackets. Taken in  conjunction with the 
body, viewed in its body, the brain is much more than a recording­
machine or a decoding-mechanism. (Not, be it  said, that i t  is merely a 
'desiring-machine' either . )  The tota l body constitutes, and produces, the 
space in which messages, codes, the coded and the decoded - so many 
choices to be made - wil l  subsequently emerge. 

The way for physical space, for the practico-sensory realm, to restore

or reconstitute i tself is therefore by struggling against the ex post facto 
projections of an accomplished intel lect, against the reductionism to 
which knowledge is prone. Successful ly waged, this struggle would 
overturn the Absolute Truth and the Realm of Sovereign Transparency 
and rehabi l i tate underground, la tera l ,  labyrinthine - even uterine or 
feminine - real i ties. An uprising of the body, in  short, against the signs 
of non-body :  The history of the body in  the final phase of Western 
culture is that of its rebel l ions . '23 

Indeed the fleshly (spatio-tempora l )  body is a l ready in  revol t .  This 
revolt, however, must not be understood as a harking-back to the 
origins, to some archa ic  or anthropological past: it is firmly anchored 
in the here and now, and the body in question is 'ours' - our body, 
which is disdained, absorbed, and broken into pieces by images. Worse 
than disdained - ignored. Th is is not a political rebel l ion, a substitute 
for social revolution, nor is it a revolt of thought, a revolt of the 
individual ,  or a revolt for freedom: it is an elemental and worldwide 
revolt which does not seek a theoretical foundation, but rather seeks by 
theoretical means to rediscover - and recognize - its own foundations. 
Above a l l  it asks theory to stop barring its way in this, to stop helping 
conceal the underpinnings that it is at pains to uncover. I ts exploratory 
activity is not di rected towards some kind of ' return to nature', nor is 
it conducted under the banner of an imagined 'spontaneity'  I ts object 
is ' l ived experience' - an experience that has been drained of al l  content 
by the mechanisms of diversion, reduction/extrapola tion, figures of 
speech, analogy, tautology, and so on. There can be no question but 
that  social space is the locus of prohibition, for it is shot through 
with both prohibitions and their counterparts, prescriptions. This fact, 
however, can most definitely not be made into the basis of an overal l  
definition, for space is not  on ly  the  space of 'no', i t  is a l so  the space of 
the body, and hence the space of 'yes', of the affirmation of  l i fe. It is 
not simply a matter, therefore, of a theoretical critique, but also of a 
'turning of the world upon its head' (Marx ) ,  of an inversion of meaning, 
and of  a subversion which 'breaks the tablets of the Law' (Nietzsche) . 

The shift, which is so hard to grasp, from the space of the body to 
the body-in-space, from opacity (warm) to translucency (cold ) ,  somehow 
facil itates the spiriting-away or scotomization of the body. How did this 
magic ever become possible - and how does i t  continue to be possible ? 
What is the foundation of a mechanism which thus abol ishes the foun­
dations ? What forces have been able in the past - and continue to be

able - to take advantage of what happens 'normal ly '  along the particular 
route which leads from the Ego to the Other, or ,  more precisely, from 
the Ego to i tsel f  via its double the Other ?  

For  the  Ego to  appear, to  manifest itself as being in 'my body', is i t  
sufficient for i t  to have oriented itsel f  in terms of left and right, to have 
marked out directions relative to itself? Once a particu lar Ego has 
formulated the words 'my body', can i t  now perforce designate and 
locate other bodies and objects ? The answer to these questions must be 
negative. Furthermore, the uttering of the words 'my body' presupposes 
the Ego's access to language and to a specific use of discourse - in short, 
it presupposes a whole h istory. What are the preconditions of such a 
history, such a use of discourse, such an intervention of language ? What 
makes the coding of Ego and Al ter Ego - and of the gap between them 
- possible ? 

For the Ego to appear, it must appear to itse lf, and its body must 
appear to it , as subtracted - and hence also extracted and abstracted -
from the world .  Being prey to the world's vicissitudes, and the potential 
victim of countless dangers, the Ego withdraws. It erects defences to 
sea l itse l f  off, to prevent access to itself. It sets up barriers to nature, 
because it feels vulnerable. It aspires to invulnerabil ity. A pipe-dream ?  
Of  course - for what we are concerned with here is indeed magic. But 
is this magic performed before or after the act of denomination ? 

Imaginary and rea l  barriers set up against attacks from outside can 
be reinforced. As Wilhelm Reich showed, defensive reactions may even 
give rise to a tough armouring.24 Some non-Western cultures, however, 
proceed otherwise, relying upon a soph isticated discipl ine which places 
the body constantly beyond the reach of variations in  its 'environment', 
safe from the onslaughts of the spatial realm.  Such is the Eastern 
response to the spatio-temporal and practico-sensory body's humble 
demands - as opposed to the Western body's commands, which promote 
verbal ization and the development of a hard protective shel l .  

In some circumstances a split occurs, and  an interstice o r  interval i s  
created - a very specific space which is  at  once magical and  real .  
Might the unconscious not, after a l l ,  consist in  an obscure nature o r  
substantia l ity which wishes and desires ? Perhaps it is not a source o f  
l anguage, nor a l anguage per se? Perhaps, rather, i t  is that very interstice, 
that ' in-between '  itself - along with whatever occupies it, gains access 
to it, and occurs therein ?  But, if an interstice, an interstice between what

°'---"' and what? Between self and self, between the body and its Ego - or, 

better, between the Ego-seeking-to-constitute-itself and its body. The 
context here is necessarily that of a long learning-process , the process 
of formation and deformation which the immature and premature 
human chi ld must undergo on the way to fami l ia l  and social maturity. 
But what is it exactly that sl ips into the interstice in question ? The 
answer is :  language, signs, abstraction - alt necessary yet fateful ,  indis­
pensable yet dangerous. This is a letha l  zone thickly strewn with dusty, 
moul dering words. What sl ips into it is what a l lows meaning to escape 
the embrace of l ived experience, to detach itself from the fleshly body. 
Words and signs faci l i tate ( indeed provoke, call forth and - at least in 
the West - command) metaphorization - the transport, as i t  were, of 
the physical body outside of itsel f. Th is operation, inextricably magical 
and rational, sets up a strange interplay between (verbal )  disembodiment 
and (empirical )  re-embodiment, between uprooting and reimplantation, 
between spatial ization in an abstract expanse and localization in  a 
determinate expanse. This is the 'mixed' space - sti l l  natural yet a lready 
produced - of the first year of l i fe, and, l ater, of poetry and art. The 
space, in a word, of representations: representational space.

The body does not fal l  under the sway of analytic thought and its 
separation of the cyclical from the l inear. The uni ty which that reflection 
is a t  such pains to decode finds refuge in the cryptic opacity which is 
the great secret of the body. For the body indeed unites cyclical and 
l inear, combining the cycles of t ime, need and desire with the l inearities 
of gesture, perambulation, prehension and the manipulation of things -
the handling of both material and abstract tools. The body subsists 
precisely at the level of the reciprocal movement between these two 
rea lms;  their difference - which is l ived, not thought - is its habitat. Is 
it not the body, in fact, since it preserves difference within repetition, 
that is  a lso responsible for the emergence of the new from the repetitive?  
Analytic thought, by contrast, because i t  evacuates difference, is unable 
to grasp how repetition is able to secrete innovation. Such thought, such 
conceptua l izing knowledge {connaissance) , cannot acknowledge that it 
underwrites the body's trials and tribulations. Yet, once it has ensconced 
itself in the gap between l ived experience and established knowledge 
(savoir), the work it does there is in the serv ice of death. An empty 
body, a body conceived of as a sieve, or as a bundle of organs analogous 



204 SPATI A L  A RCH ITECfO N I CS 
to a bundle of things, a body 'dismembered ' or treated as members 
unrelated to one another, a body without organs - all such supposedly 
pathological symptomatology stems in rea l i ty from the ravages of rep­
resentation and discourse, which are only exacerbated by modern 
society, with i ts ideologies and contradictions ( including that between 
permissiveness and repressiveness in  space ) .  

Can the  breaking-into-pieces or fragmentation of the  body - or ,  better, 
a bad relationship of the Ego to its body - be laid at the door of language 
alone ? Do the decomposition of the body in to loca l ized functions and 
its abandonment as a total i ty whether subjective or objective occur as 
a resu l t  of the assignment to body pans, from earl iest chi ldhood, of 
discrete names, so that the phal l us, the eyes , and so on, become so many 
dissociated elements with in  a representational space that is subsequently 
experienced in a pathological manner? 

The problem with this thesis i s  that it exonerates the Christian (or 
rather the Judaeo-Christian)  tradit ion, wh ich misapprehends and 
despises the body, relegating i t  to the charnel -house i f  not to the Devi l .  
It a l so exonerates capi tal ism, which has extended the divis ion of labour 
into the very bodies of workers and even non-workers. Taylorism, one 
of the fi rst 'scient ific' approaches to productiv i ty, reduced the body as 
a whole to a smal l  number of motions subjected to strictly control led 
l inear determinations. A division of  labour so extreme, whereby special­
ization extends to individual gestures, has undoubtedly had as much 
influence as l inguistic discourse on the breaking-down of the body into 
a mere collection of unconnected parts. 

The Ego's relationship to the body, which i s  annexed l i ttle by litt le 
to the realm of  theoretical thought, turns out to be both complex and 
diverse. Indeed, there are as many d ifferent relationsh ips between the 
Ego and its own body - as many forms of  appropriation of that body, 
or of fai lure to appropriate i t  - as  there are societies, 'cultures', or even 
perhaps individuals .  

Furthermore, the Ego's practical relationsh ip to its own body deter­
mines i ts relationship to other bodies, to nature, and to space. And vice 
versa : the relat ionship to space is reflected in the relationsh ip to the 
other, to the other's body and the other's consciousness. The analysis -
and self-analysis - of the total body, the way in which that body locates 
itself and the way in which i t  becomes fragmented, all are determined 
by a practice which includes discourse but which cannot be reduced to 
it. The detachment of work from play, from the gestures of ritua l  and 
from the erotic rea lm only serves to make whatever interaction or 
interference does occur that much more significant. Under the conditions 



SPATI A L  A R C H ITECTON ICS 205 
of modern industry and city l i fe, abstraction holds sway over the 
relationship to the body . As nature fades into the background, there is 
nothing to restore the total body - nothing in  the world of objects, 
noth ing in the world of action . The Western tradit ion, with its misappre­
hension of the body, remanifests itsel f in increasingly strange ways ; 
laying the blame for a l l  the damage at the door of discourse alone is to 
excu lpate not only that tradition but a lso ' real '  abstract space.

The body's i nventiveness needs no demonstration, for the body itse l f  
reveals it ,  and deploys it in space. Rhythms in al l  their mult ipl ic ity 
interpenetrate one another. In the body and around it, as on the surface 
of a body of water, or with in  the mass of a l iquid, rhythms are forever 
crossing and recrossing, superimposing themselves upon each other, 
always bound to space. They exclude neither primal tendencies nor any 
other energetic  forces, whether these invest the interior or the surface 
of the body, whether they are 'normal ' or excessive, whether they are 
responses to externa l  action or endogenous and explosive in character. 
Such rhythms have to do with needs, which may be d ispersed as tenden­
cies, or disti l led into desi re. I f  we attempt to specify them, we find that 
some rhythms are easy to identify :  breath ing, the heartbeat, thirst, 
hunger, and the need for sleep are cases in  point. Others, however, such 
as those of sexual ity, fertil ity, social l i fe, or thought, are relatively 
obscure. Some operate on the surface, so to speak, whereas others spring 
from h idden depths. 

I t  is possible to envision a sort of ' rhythm analysis '  which would 
address itself to the concrete rea l i ty of rhythms, and perhaps even to 
their use (or appropriation ) .  Such an approach would seek to discover 
those rhythms whose existence is signal led only through mediations, 
through indirect effects or manifestations. Rhythm analysis might 
eventual ly even displace psychoanalysis, as being more concrete, more 
effective, and closer to a pedagogy of appropriation ( the appropriation 
of the body, as of spatial practice ) .  It might be expected to apply the 
principles and laws of a general rhythmology to the l iving body and i ts 
internal and external relationships. Such a discipline's field of application 
par excellence, its preferred sphere of experiment, would be the sphere 
of music and dance, the sphere of 'rhythmic cel ls' and their effects. 
The repetitions and redundancies of rhythms, their symmetries and 
asymmetries, interact in ways that cannot be reduced to the d iscrete and 



206 SPA TI A L  A RCHITECTON ICS 

fixed determinants of analytic thought. Only i f  this is clearly grasped 
can the polyrhythmic body be understood and appropriated. Rhythms 
differ from one another in their amplitude, in  the energies they ferry 
and deploy, and in their frequency . Such differences, conveyed and 
reproduced by the rhythms which embody them, translate into intensity 
or strength of anticipation, tension and action . Al l  these factors interact 
with one another within the body, which is traversed by rhythms rather 
as the 'ether' is  traversed by waves. 

The way in which rhythms may be said to embrace both cycl ical and 
l inear is i l lustrated by music, where the measure and the beat are l inear 
in character, while motifs, melody and particularly harmony are cyclical 
( the division of octaves in to twelve half-tones, and the reiteration of 
sounds and intervals with in octaves ) .  Much the same may be sa id of 
dance, a gestural system whose organization combines two codes, that 
of the dancer and that of the spectator (who keeps time by clapping or 
with other body movements} : thus, as evocative (paradigmatic) gestures 
recur, they are integrated into a ritual ly l inked gestural chain .  

What do we know about rhythms, as sequential relationships in space, 
as objective relationships ? The notion of flows (of energy, matter, etc . )  
is self-sufficient on ly in political economy.  It is i n  any case a lways 
subordinate to the notion of space. As for 'drive', this idea is a transpo­
sition onto the psychic level of the fundamental, but at the same time 
dissociated, idea of rhythm. What we live are rhythms - rhythms experi­
enced subjectively. Which means that, here at  least, ' l ived' and 'con­
ceived' are close : the laws of nature and the laws governing our bodies 
tend to overlap with each other - as perhaps too with the laws of so­
called socia l  real i ty .  

An organ ha s  a rhythm, bu t  the rhythm does not have, nor  i s  i t ,  an  
organ ;  rather, i t  is an in teraction. A rhythm invests places, but  i s  not 
itself a place; it is not a thing, nor an aggregation of th ings, nor yet a 
s imple flow. It embodies its own law, its own regularity, which it derives 
from space - from its own space - and from a relationship between 
space and time. Every rhythm possesses and occupies a spatio-temporal 
rea l ity which is known by our science and mastered so far as its physical 
aspect (wave motion)  is concerned, but which is misapprehended from 
the point of view of l iving beings, organisms, bodies and socia l  practice. 
Yet social practice is made up of rhythms - dai ly, monthly, yearly, and 
so on. That these rhythms have become more complicated than natural 
rhythms is highly probable. A powerful unsett l ing factor in this regard 
is the practico-social dominance of l inear over cycl ical repetition - that 
is to say, the dominance of one aspect of rhythms over another. 



SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO NICS 207 
Through the mediation of rhythms (in all three senses of 'mediation' :  

means, medium, intermediary) ,  a n  animated space comes into being 
which is an extension of the space of bodies . How exactly the laws of 
space and of i ts dual i ties (symmetries/asymmetries, demarcation/orien­
tation, etc . )  chime with the l aws of rhythmic movement ( regularity, 
diffusion, in terpenetration) is a question to which we do not as yet have 
the answer.

What is the unconscious i f  not consciousness itself, i f  not consciousness 
and i ts double, which i t  contains and keeps with in itsel f - namely, 'self­
consciousness' ? Consciousness, then, qua mirror image, qua repetition 
and mirage. What does this mean ? In  the first place, i t  means that any 
substantification or natural ization of the unconscious, locating it above 
or below consciousness, must sooner or later fal l  into ideological 
fatuity. 25 Consciousness is  not unaware of itself; i f  it were, of whom 
and of what would it be the consciousness ? In essence, and by definition, 
self-consciousness is a redupl ication, a sel f-reproduction, as much as i t  
is  a ' reflection'  of objects . But does it know itself? No. It is  acquainted 
neither with the conditions of its own existence nor with the laws ( i f  
any) which govern i t .  In  th i s  sense it may j ustifiably be compared to 
language, not only because there is no consciousness without a language, 
but also because those who speak, and even those who write, are 
unacqua inted with the conditions and laws of language, of th.lilir langu­
age, even as they practise it .  What  then is the 'status '  of language? 
Between knowledge and ignorance here there is a mediation which 
sometimes functions effectively as an intermediary but which may also 
block the way. This mediation is misapprehension. Like the flower 
which does not know i t  is a flower, self-consciousness, so much vaunted 
in  Western thought from Descartes to Hegel (and even more recently, 
at least in  phi losophy) ,  misapprehends i ts own preconditions whether 
natural (physica l )  or practical, mental or socia l .  We have long known 
that from early chi ldhood the consciousness of 'conscious beings' appre­
hends itsel f as a reflection of what it has wrought in 'the object' or in 
the other by means of certain privi leged products, namely instrumental 
objects and speech . Consciousness thus apprehends i tself in  and through 

" See L 'inconscient, proceedings of  the sixth Col loque de Bonneval ,  1 960 ( Par is :  Desclee 
de Brouwer, 1 966) ,  pp. 347ff. 



208 SPATI AL ARCH ITECTO N I CS 

what it produces : by playing with a simple stick, for example - by 
disordering or breaking things - the chi ld begins to 'be' .  Conscious 
beings apprehend themselves in a melange of violence, lack, desires, 
needs, and knowledge properly (or improperly) so called. 

In this sense, then - but not exactly after the fashion of language as 
such - consciousness misapprehends i tself. Consciousness, itsel f the locus 
of knowing, thus permits the emergence of a knowledge characterized 
by misunderstanding: on the one hand, the i l lusion of a perfect or 
transparent knowledge (the Idea, divine knowledge, absolute 
Knowledge) ;  on the other hand, notions of a mystery, of an unknowable 
rea lm, or of an  unconscious. To return to this last term : it i s  neither 
true nor false to speak of an unconscious. Hence it is both true and 
false at  the same t ime. The unconscious resembles an i l lusion with a 
raison d'etre - a sort of mirage effect. People, and more particu larly 
psychologists, psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, use the unconscious as 
an  appropriate receptacle for whatever they please to consign to it, 
including the preconditions of consciousness in the nervous system or 
bra in ;  action and language ;  what is remembered and what is forgotten ; 
and the body and its own history. The tendency to fetishize the uncon­
scious is inherent in the image of unconsciousness itsel f. This  is why 
this idea opens the door so wide to ontology, metaphysics, the death 
drive, and so on. 

Sti l l ,  the term is meaningful in that it designates that unique process 
whereby every human ' being' is formed, a process which involves 
redupl ication, doubling, repetition at another level of the spatial body; 
language and imaginary/real spatial ity; redundancy and surprise; learn­
ing through experience of  the natural and socia l  worlds ; and the forever­
compromised appropriation of a 'reality' wh ich dominates nature by 
means of  abstraction but which is  itsel f dominated by the worst of 
abstractions, the abstraction of power. The 'unconscious' in this sense, 
as the imaginary and real locus of a struggle, as the obscure counter­
weight to that ' luminous' entity known as culture, has nothing in 
common with the ragbag concept of the psychologists and other experts. 

What an enigma sleep presents for philosophy!  How can the cogito 
ever s lumber? I ts duty is to keep vigil t i l l  the end of time, as Pascal 
understood and reiterated. Sleep reproduces l i fe in the womb and fore­
shadows death ; yet this kind of rest has its own ful lness. In sleep the 
body gathers itsel f together, bui lding up its energy reserves by imposing 
silence on its information receptors. It closes down, and passes through 
a moment with its own truth, its own beauty, its own worth . This is 
one moment among others, a poetic moment. It is now that the 'space 



SPAT I A L  ARCH ITECTO N I CS 209 

of  the dream' makes its paradoxical appearance. At once imaginary and 
rea l ,  th is space is different from the space of language, though of the 
same order, and the fa ithfu l  guardian of sleep rather than of social 
learning. Is this then the space of 'drives ' ?  It would be better described 
as a space where dispersed and broken rhythms are reconstituted, a 
space for the poetic reconstruction of s ituations in which wishes are 
present - but wishes which are not so much fu lfi l led as simply pro­
claimed. I t  is a space of enjoyment, indeed i t  establ ishes a v irtual reign 
of pleasure, though erotic dreams break up on the reefs of the dreamer's 
pleasure and dis i l lus ion. The space of the dream is strange and al ien, 
yet at the same time as close to us as is possible . Rarely coloured, even 
more rarely animated by music, i t  still has a sensual-sensory character. 
It is a theatrical space even more than a quotidian or poetic one: a 
putting into images of oneself, for onesel f. 

Visual  space in its speci ficity contains an immense crowd, veritable 
hordes of  objects, things, bodies. These differ by v irtue of their place 
and that place's local pecu l iari ties, as also by virtue of their relationship 
with 'subjects ' .  Everywhere there are privi leged objects which arouse a 
particu lar  expectation or interest, while others are treated with indiffer­
ence. Some objects are known, some unknown, and some misappre­
hended. Some serve as relays: transitory or transitional in  nature, they 
refer to other objects. Mirrors, though privileged objects, nevertheless 
have a transitional function of th is kind. 

Consider a window. Is it s imply a void traversed by a l ine of sigh t ?  
No .  In any case, the question would remain :  what l i ne  of sight - and 
whose ? The fact is that the window is a non-object which cannot fai l  
to become an object. As a transitional object i t  has two senses, two 
orientations :  from ins ide to outside, and from outside to inside. Each is 
marked in  a specific way, and each bears the mark of the other. Thus 
windows a re d ifferently framed outside ( for the outside) and inside ( for 
the inside ) .  

Consider a door. Is it simply an aperture in the  wal l ? No .  It is  framed 
(in the broadest sense of  the term) .  A door without a frame would fu lfi l  
one  function and one function only, that of a l lowing passage. And i t  
would fu lfi l  that  function poorly, for something would be missing. 
Function cal ls for something other, someth ing more, somethi ng better 
than functional ity a lone. Its surround makes a door into an object. In 
conjunction with their frames, doors atta in the status of works, works 
of a kind not far removed from pictures and mirrors. Transit ional ,  
symbol ic and functional ,  the object 'door' serves to br ing a space, the 
space of  a ' room',  say,  or that of the street, to an end; and i t  heralds 



2 1 0  SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO N I CS 
the reception to be expected in the neighbouring room, or in the house 
or interior that  awaits . The threshold or s i l l  of an  entrance is another 
transitional object, one which has traditional ly enjoyed an almost ritua l 
significance (crossing a threshold as analogous to passing through a 
lock, or 'graduating' ) .  So objects fal l  spontaneously into such classes as 
transitional objects, functional objects, and so on. These classes, how­
ever, are a lways provisiona l :  the classes themselves are subject to change, 
while objects are l iable to move from one class to another. 

This brings us to the a rticu lation between sensory and practico­
perceptua l  space on the one hand and specific or practico-socia l  space, 
the space of this or that particu lar society, on the other. Can socia l  
space be defined in terms of the  projection of an ideology into a 
neutral space ? No. Ideologies dictate the locations of particu lar activities, 
determining that such and such a place should be sacred, for example, 
while some other should not, or that a temple, a palace or a church 
must be here, and not there. But ideologies do not produce space :  rather, 
they are in space, and of it . It is the forces of production and the 
relations of production that produce social space. In the process a global 
social practice is brought into being, comprising al l  the diverse activities 
which, at  least up to now, have characterized any society: education, 
admin istration, polit ics ,  military organization, and so on. It fol lows that 
not all localization should be a ttributed to ideology . 'Place' in society, 
h igh society versus the lower depths, the pol i tical ' left' and 'right' - a l l  
these apparent forms of localization derive not only from ideology but  
also from the symbolic properties of space, properties inherent to that 
space's practical occupation. 

In what does sensory space, within socia l  space, consist ? It consists 
in an 'unconsciously' dramatized interplay of relay points and obstacles, 
reflections, references, mirrors and echoes - an interplay implied, but 
not explicitly designated, by this discourse. Within it, specular and 
transitional objects exist s ide by s ide with tools ranging from simple 
sticks to the most sophisticated instruments designed for hand and body. 
Does the body, then, retrieve its unity, broken by language, from its 
own image coming towards it, as it were, from the outside ? More than 
this, and better, i s  required before that can happen. In the first place, a 
welcoming space is cal led for - the space of nature, fi l led with non­
fragmented 'beings' ,  with plants and animals .  ( It is architecture's job to 
reproduce such a space where i t  is lacking. ) And then effective, practical 
actions must be performed, making use of the basic materials and 
materiel avai lable .  

Spl i ts reappear cont inual ly ;  they are bridged by metaphor and meto-



SPATIAL A R C H ITECTO N I CS 2 1 1  
nymy. Language possesses a practical function but i t  cannot harbour 
knowledge without masking it. The playful aspect of space escapes it, 
and only emerges in play itsel f (by definition) ,  and in irony and humour. 
Objects serve as markers for rhythms, as reference points, as centres . 
Their fixedness, however, is only relative. Distances here may be abo­
lished by look, word or gesture; they may equal ly wel l be exaggerated 
thereby. Distantiation a l ternates with convergence, absence with pres­
ence, concealment with revelation, reality with appearance - and al l  
overlap in a theatre of reciprocal impl ication and explication where the 
action halts only during sleep. Relations in  the perceptual realm do not 
reflect social relations as such - on the contrary, they disguise them. 
Social relations properly so cal led - i .e .  the relations of production -
are not visible in sensory-sensual (or practico-perceptual )  space. They 
are circumvented. They need therefore to be decoded, but even in their 
decoded form i t  is difficu lt for them to be extracted from mental and 
located in  socia l  space. Sensory-sensual space tends to establish itse l f  
with in the visible-readable sphere, and in  so doing it promotes the 
misapprehension of  aspects, indeed the dominant aspects, of social 
practice : labour, the division of labour, the organiza tion of  labour, and 
so on. This space, which does not recognize its own potential for 
playfulness ( for it is readily taken over by play) does enshrine socia l  
relationships, which appear in it as relationships of opposition and 
contrast, as l inked sequences . Long predominant among such relation­
ships have been right and left, h igh and low, central and periphera l ,  
demarcated and oriented space, near and far, symmetrical and asym­
metrical ,  and auspicious and inauspicious. Nor should we forget 
paternity and maternity, male places and female places, and their attend­
ant symbols. Now, it is true that the aim of our discussion is to establ ish 
the paradigm of a space.  Al l  the same, it is very important not to 
overlook, in the immediate vicinity of the body, and serving to extend 
it into the surrounding networks of relationships and pathways, the 
various types of objects. Among them are everyday utensi ls or tools -
pot, cup, knife, hammer, or fork - which extend the body in accord 
with its rhythms; and those, such as the implements of peasant or 
artisan, which leave the body further behind, and establish the ir  own 
spatial realms. Socia l  space is defined (a lso) as the locus and medium 
of speech and writing, which sometimes disclose and sometimes dissimu­
late, sometimes express what is true and sometimes what is false (with 
the fa lse serving the truth as relay, resource and foundation ) .  It is in 
this world that the quest for enjoyment takes place, a quest whose 
object, once found, is destroyed by the act of tak ing pleasure itse l f. 



2 1 2  SPATI AL AR\.HfTECl'O N I C S  

Enjoyment in this sense forever evades the grasp. A game of mirrors, 
then : plenitude fol lowed by disi l l usion. And it is a game that never ends, 
as the Ego recognizes itse lf, and misapprehends itse lf, i n  the Alter Ego. 
Misunderstanding a l so nourishes attitudes of l isten ing and expectancy. 
Then the tide of  the visual with i ts clarity overwhelms what is merely 
audible or touchable. 

We have yet to consider the space of production, and the production 
of  space. Sensory-sensual space is simply a sediment destined to survive 
as one l ayer or element in the stratification and interpenetration of socia l  
spaces. 

We have a lready noted one overa ll characteristic of production:  from 
products, be they objects or spaces, a l l  traces of productive activity are 
so far as possible erased. What of the mark of the worker or workers 
who did the producing? It has no meaning or value unless the 'worker' 
is a l so a user and owner - as in the case of craftsmen or peasants. 
Objects are only perfected by being 'finished ' .  

There is nothing new about this, but  it is appropriate to reiterate it, 
for it has important consequences. The fact is that this erasure facil itates 
the procedure whereby the worker is deprived of the product of his  
labour. I t  is tempting to genera l ize, and argue that such erasures of 
traces make possible an  immense number of transfers and substitutions, 
and indeed that this kind of concealment is the basis not only of myths, 
mystifications and ideologies, but also of all domination and all power. 
An extrapolation of  this kind, however, cannot be justified. In space, 
nothing ever disappears - no point, no place. Sti l l ,  the concealment of 
the productive l abour that goes into the product has one significant 
impl ication : social space is not coextensive with the space of socia l  
l abour. Which is not to say that social space is a space of enjoyment, 
of non-labour, but merely that produced or worked objects pass from 
the space of labour to the enveloping socia l  space only once the traces of 
l abour have been effaced from them. Whence, of course, the commodity.

At one level of social space, or in one region of it, concatenations of 
gestures are deployed. In  i ts broadest sense, the category of the 'gestural ' 
takes in the gestures of labour - the gestures of peasants, craftsmen or 
industrial workers. I n  a narrower and more restrictive sense, i t does not 
cover technical gestures or productive acts ; it does not extend beyond 
the gestu res and acts of 'civ i l '  l i fe exclusive of all special ized activities 



SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO NICS 2 1 3  
a n d  p laces (such a s  those associated with war, rel igion o r  j ustice) ; i n  
short, a l l  institutional gestures, coded and located a s  such, are barred. 
But, whether understood in the broad or the narrow sense, gestures as 
a whole mobil ize and activate the total body. 

Bodies (each body) and interbodily space may be pictured as possessed 
of specific assets : the materials (heredity, objects) which serve as their 
starting-point, and the materiel which they have avai lable to them 
(behaviour patterns, conditioning - what are sometimes cal led 
stereotypes ) .  For these bodies, the natural space and the abstract space 
which confront and surround them are in no way separable, as they 
may be from an analytic perspective. The individual situates his body 
in its own space and apprehends the space around the body. The energy 
avai lable to each seeks employment in that space, and the other bodies 
which that energy encounters, be they inert or living, constitute obstacles, 
dangers, coagents, or prizes for it. The actions of each individual involve 
his multiple affiliations and basic consti tution, with its dual aspect: first, 
the axes and planes of symmetry ,  which govern the movements of 
arms, legs, hands and l imbs in general ;  secondly, the rot:ltions and the 
gyrations which govern all sorts of movements of trunk or head -
circular, spiral, 'figures of eight' ,  and so on. The accompl ishment of 
gestures, for which this materiel i s  the prerequisite, further implies the 
existence of affil iations, of groups ( family, tr ibe, vi l lage, city, etc. ) and 
of activity. I t  also cal ls  for specific materials - for those objects which 
the activity in question requires; such objects are ' rea l ' ,  and therefore 
materia l  in nature, but they are also symbolic, and hence freighted with 
affect. 

What  shal l we say of the human hand ? It certainly seems no less 
complex or ' rich' than the eye, or than language. The hand can feel ,  
caress, grasp, brutalize, hit, k i l l .  The sense of touch is the d iscoverer of 
matter. Thanks to tools - which are separate from nature and responsible 
for severing from nature whatever they impinge upon, but which are 
nevertheless extensions of the body and its rhythms ( for instance, the 
hammer with its linear and repetitive action , or the potter's wheel with 
its circular and continuous one) - the hand modifies materials . Muscular 
effort can mobi l ize energies of a massive kind, and often in enormous 
quanti ties, to support repetitive gestures such as those associated with 
labour ( but a lso those cal led for by games ) .  By contrast, the search for 
information about things through skin contact, through feel ing, through 
caresses, rel ies on the use of subtle energies. 

The chief materiel employed by social gestures, then, consists of 
articulated movements. The articulation of human l imbs is refined and 



2 1 4  SPATI A L  A R C H ITECTONICS 

complex ; i f  one rakes the fingers, the hand, the wrist and the arm into 
account, the total number of segments involved is very large. 

More than one theorist has drawn a distinction between inarticulate 
and articu late as a way of distinguishing nature from culture: on the 
one hand, the inarticulate sphere of cries, tears, expressions of pain or 
pleasure, the sphere of spontaneous and animal l i fe ;  on the other, the 
articulate sphere of  words, of language and discourse, of thought and 
of the clear consciousness of self, things and acts. What is missing from 
this account i s  the mediation of bodily gestures. Are not such gestures, 
articulated and l inked together as they are, more l ikely than drives to 
lie at the origin (so to speak) of language ? Bound together outside the 
rea lm of work as  well as within it, could they not have contributed to 
the development of that part of the brain which 'arriculates' l i nguistic 
and gestura l activity ? In chi ldhood, in the body of the child, there 
arguably exists a pre-verbal, gestural capacity - that is, a capacity which 
is concretely practical or 'operational ' ,  and which constitutes the basis 
of the child's fi rst  relationship as 'subject' to perceptible objects. Pre­
verbal gestures of this kind might fa l l  under several rubrics : destructive 
gestures ( foreshadowing later productive ones), gestures of  displacement, 
gestures of seriation, and gestures of grouping (groups being closed 
series) . 

The most sophisticated gestural systems - those of Asian dance, for 
example - bring into play a l l  segments of the l imbs, even the fingertips, 
and invest them with symbolic (cosmic) significance. But less complex 
systems, too, qual i fy fu lly as wholes invested with meaning: that is to 
say, as  coded - and decodable - entities. It is legitimate to speak of 
'codes' here because the ordering of gestures is laid down beforehand, 
and has ritua l  and ceremonial aspects. Such ensembles of gestures are 
made up, l ike language, of symbols, signs and signals .  Symbols embody 
their own meaning; signs refer from a signifier to what is signified; 
signa ls  elicit an immediate or deferred act ion which may be aggressive, 
a ffective, erotic, or whatever. Space is perceived as an interva l, separating 
a deferred action from the gesture which heralds, proposes or signifies 
it . Gestures are l inked on the basis of opposi tions ( for instance, rapid 
versus slow, stiff versus loose, peaceful versus violent) and on the basis 
of ritual ized (and hence coded) ru les. They may then be said to constitute 
a l anguage in which expressiveness (that of the body) and signification 
( for others - other consciousnesses, other bodies) are no further apart 
than nature from culture, than the abstract from the practica l .  A highly 
dignified demeanour, for instance, demands that  the axes and planes of 
symmetry govern the body in motion, so that  they are preserved even 



SPAT I A L  A R C H ITECTO N ICS 215  

a s  i t  moves around :  the posture i s  straight, t h e  gestures are of the kind 
we th ink of as harmonious. By contrast, attitudes of humi l i ty and 
humi l iation flatten the body against the ground: the vanquished are 
supposed to prostrate themselves, worshippers to kneel, and the guilty 
to lower their heads and kiss the earth . And in the display of clemency 
or indulgence the incl ining of the body parallels the bending of the wil l  
in compromise. 

I t  goes without saying that such codes are specific to a particular 
society ; indeed they stipulate an affi l ia tion to that society. To belong to 
a given society is to know and use i ts codes for politeness, courtesy, 
affection, parley, negotiation, trading, and so on - as also for the 
declaration of hosti l it ies { for codes having to do with social a l l iance are 
inevitably subtended by codes of insolence, insult and open aggression) .  

The importance o f  p laces and space i n  gestural systems needs empha­
sizing. High and low have great significance: on the one hand the 
ground, the feet and the lower members, and on the other the head and 
whatever surmounts or covers i t  - hair, wigs, plumes, headdresses, 
parasols, and so forth . Right and left are s imi larly rich in meaning ( in  
the  West, the l eft hand has of course acquired negative - 'sinister' -
connotations) . Variations in the use of the voice, as in singing, serve to 
accentuate such meanings: shril l/deep, h igh/low, loud/soft. 

Gestural systems embody ideology and bind it to practice. Through 
gestures, ideology escapes from pure abstraction and performs actions 
(for example, the clenched-fist salute or the sign of the cross) .  Gestural 
systems connect representations of space with representational spaces -
or, at least, they do so under certain  privi leged conditions. With their 
l iturgical gestures, for instance, priests evoke the divine gestures which 
created the universe by mimicking them in a consecrated space. Gestures 
are also closely bound up with the objects which fill space - with 
furniture, cloth ing, instruments {k i tchen utensi ls, work tools) ,  games, 
and places of residence. Al l  of which testifies to the complexity of the 
gestural realm.  

May th i s  realm then be sa id to embrace an essential ly i ndefin i te -
and hence indefinable - variety of codes ? We should by now be able to 
clear up this rather thorny problem. The fact is that the mult ipl icity of 
codes has determinants which are susceptible of categorization : everyday 
gestures differ from the gestu res associated with feasts, the rites of 
friendship contrast with the rights of antagonism, and the everyday 
microgestural rea lm is clearly distinct from the macrogestural one, which 
is the realm of crowds in action . There are also, are there not, gestures 
- signs or signals - which al low passage from one code or subcode to 



2 1 6  SPATI AL ARCHITECTO N I CS 

another, interrupting the one so as to open the way to the other ? 
Undoubtedly so. 

We have every reason to speak of 'subcodes' and general codes in 
this connection. In the first p lace it makes it possible, i f  so desi red, to 
class i fy codes by species and genus, as it were. And it a l lows us to avoid 
the 'unnecessary mult ipl ication of entities' ( in the event, of codes) : why 
shou ld Occam's razor not be applied to the relatively new concepts of 
coding and decoding, of message and decipherment ?  Above al l ,  however, 
we must avoid conceiving of or imagining a spatial code which is merely 
a subcode of discourse, so that constructed space is seen as somehow 
dependent on discourse or on a moda l i ty of it .  The study of gestures 
certainly inval idates any such view of things. 

My aim in the foregoing discussion has not been to find a rationale 
for gestures but rather to clarify the relationship between gestural sys­
tems and space. Why do many Oriental peoples l ive close to the ground, 
using low furni ture and s i tting on their heel s ?  Why does the Western 
world, by contrast, have rigid, right-angled furniture which obl iges 
people to assume constricted postures ? And why do the dividing-lines 
between such a tti tudes or (unformulated) codes correspond exactly to 
rel igious and pol i tical frontiers ? Diversi ty in  this sphere is sti l l  as incom­
prehensible as the diversity of languages. Perhaps the study of social 
spaces wi l l  throw some l ight on these questions. 

Organized gestures, which is to say ritua l ized and codified gestures, 
a re not simply performed in 'physica l '  space, in the space of bodies. 
Bodies themselves generate spaces, which are produced by and for their 
gestures. The l inking of  gestures corresponds to the articulation and 
l inking of well-defined spatial segments, segments which repeat, but 
whose repetition gives rise to novelty. Consider, for example, the cloister, 
and the solemn pace of the monks who walk there. The spaces produced 
in the way we have been discussing are o ften mult ifunctional (the agora, 
for i nstance ) ,  a l though some strictly defined gestures, such as those 
associated with sport or war, produced their own specific spaces very 
early on - stadia,  parade grounds, t i l tyards, and so forth . Many such 
socia l  spaces are given rhythm by the gestures which are produced 
within them, and which produce them (and they are accordingly often 
measured in paces, cubits, feet, palms or thumbs) .  The everyday micro­
gestural realm generates i ts own spaces (for example, footways, corri­
dors, places for eating), and so does the most h igh ly formal ized macroge­
stural rea lm ( for instance, the ambulatories of Christian churches, or 
podia ) .  When a gestural space comes in to conjunction with a conception 
of the world possessed of its own symbol ic system, a grand creation 



SPATI A L  ARCH ITECTO N I CS 2 17  
may result .  Cloisters are a case in point. What has happened here is 
that, happi ly ,  a gestural space has succeeded in mooring a mental space 
- a space of contemplation and theological abstraction - to the earth, 
thus a l lowing i t  to express i tself symbolica l ly and to become part of a 
practice, the practice of a wel l -defined group within a well-defined 
society. Here, then, is a space in which a l i fe balanced between the 
contemplation of the sel f  in i ts finiteness and that of a transcendent 
infin ity may experience a happiness composed of  quietude and a ful ly 
accepted lack of fu lfi lment. As a space for contemplatives, a place of 
promenade and assembly, the cloister connects a finite and determinate 
loca l i ty - social ly particu larized but not unduly restricted as to use, 
a lbeit definitely control led by an order or rule - to a theology of the 
infinite. Columns, capita ls, scu lptures - these are semantic differentials 
which mark off the route fol lowed (and laid down) by the steps of the 
monks during their time of (contemplative) recreation.  

If  the gestu res of 'spiritua l '  exchange - the exchange of symbols and 
signs, with their  own pecul iar delights, have produced spaces, the ges­
tures of material exchange have been no less productive. Parley, nego­
tiation and trade have always cal led for appropriate spaces. Over the 
ages merchants have been an active and original group, and productive 
after their fash ion. Today the realm of commodities has extended its 
sway, along with that of capita l ,  to the entire planet, and it has conse­
quently assumed an oppressive role. The commodity system thus comes 
in for a good deal of denigration, and tends to be blamed for all i l ls .  
I t  should be remembered, however, that for centuries merchants and 
merchandise stood for freedom, hope and expanding horizons relative 
to the constraints imposed by ancient communities, whether agrarian 
societies or the more pol itical cities. Merchants brought both riches 
and essential goods such as cereals, spices or fabrics. Commerce was 
synonymous with communication, and the exchange of goods went 
hand in hand with the exchange of ideas and pleasures. Today there are 
rather more remnants of that state of a ffa irs in the East than in the 
West. The earliest commercial a reas - porticoes, basi licas or market 
halls dating from a time when merchants and their gestures created their 
own spaces - are thus not without beauty. ( It is worth asking ourselves 
en passant why spaces devoted to sensual pleasures seem so much rarer 
than places of power, knowledge or wisdom, and exchange . )  

In attempting to account for these multifarious creations, the  evo­
cation of 'proxemics ' ,  whether in connection with chi ldren or adults, 
couples or fami l ies, groups or crowds, is  inadequate .  Hall 's anthropo­
logical descriptive term 'proxemic' , which is related to the idea of

Structural  distinctions between binary operations, levels and dimensions 
must not be al lowed to obscure the great dia lectical movements that 
traverse the world-as-tota l i ty and help define it .  

First moment: things (objects) in space. Production, sti l l respectfu l  of  
nature, proceeds by selecting portions of space and using them along 
with their contents . Agricu lture predominates, and societies produce 
palaces, monuments, peasant dwel l ings, and works of art. Time is 
inseparable from space. Human labour directed at nature deconsecrates 
it, but disti ls the sacredness of elements of it into religious and pol i tical 
edifices. Form (of thought or of action ) is inseparable from content. 

Second moment :  from this prehistory certa in societies emerge and 
accede to the h istorical plane - that is, to the plane of accumulation (of 
riches, knowledge, and techniques) - and hence to the plane of pro­
duction, first for exchange, then for money and capi tal . It is now that 
artifice, which at first has the appearance of  art, prevai ls over nature, 
and that form and the formal separate from their content; abstraction 
and signs as such are elevated to the rank of basic and ult imate truths ;  
and consequently philosophical and scientific thought comes to conceive 
of a space without things or objects, a space which is somehow of a 
h igher order than its contents, a means for them to exist or a medium 
in which they exist .  Once detached from th ings, space understood as a 
form emerges either as substance (Descartes) or else, on the contrary, 
as 'pure a priori' ( Kant ) .  Space and time are sundered, but space brings 
time under its sway in the praxis of accumulation . 

Third moment :  relative now, space and things are reunited ; th rough 
thought, the contents of space, and in the first place time, are restored 
to it. The fact is that space 'in itself' is ungraspable, unthinkable, 
unknowable. Time 'in itself', absolute time, is no less unknowable. But

that i s  the whole point: time i s  known and actual ized i n  space, becoming 
a socia l  rea l i ty by v i rtue of a spatial practice. Simil'!rly, space is known 
only in  and through time. Unity in difference, the same in the other 
(and vice versa ) ,  are thus made concrete. But with the development of 
capital ism and its praxis a difficulty arises in che relations becween space 
and time. The capital ist mode of production begins by producing things, 
and by ' investing' in places . Then the reproduction of socia l  rela tions 
becomes problematic, as it plays a part in  practice, modifying it in the 
process . And eventual ly it becomes necessary to reproduce nature also, 
and to master space by producing it - that is, the political space of 
capita l ism - while at the same rime reducing time in  order to prevent the 
production of new social relations. But capita l ism is surely approaching a 
threshold beyond which reproduction wil l  no longer be able to prevent 
the production ,  not of things, buc of new socia l  relations. What would 
those relations consist in ? Perhaps in the unity, at once famil iar and 
new, of space and time, a unity long misapprehended, split up and 
superseded by the rash attribution of  priority to space over time. 

The movement I am describing may seem abstract. And indeed it is! 
For here, a t  the present juncture, as in Marx's work (or at least in part 
of i t ) ,  a reflection upon the virtual is what guides our understanding 
of the rea l (or actua l ) ,  while also retroactively affecting - and hence 
i l luminating - the antecedents and the necessary preconditions of that 
rea l i ty .  At the present 'moment', modernity with its contradictions has 
only j ust  entered upon the stage. Marx took a similar tack to the one 
we are raking when ( in a chapter of Capital that has only recently 
been published) he envisaged the implications and consequences of the 
extension of the 'world of commodities' and of the world market, 
developments which were at that time no more than virrual ities embed­
ded in history (the history, that is, of accumulation ) .  

How should the charge that this procedure o r  method i s  mere extra­
polation be answered?  By pointing out the legitimacy of pushing an idea 
or hypothesis as far as  it will go. The idea of producing, for example, 
today extends beyond the production of this or that thing or work to 
the production of space. And this has its retroactive effect on our 
understanding of antecedents - in this case an understanding of pro­
ductive forces and forms. Our modus operandi, then, is a sort of forcing­
house approach . Extreme hypotheses are permissible. The hypothesis, 
for instance, that the commodity (or the world market) will come to 
occupy all space ;  that exchange value will impose the law of value upon 
the whole planet; and chat in some sense world history is nothing but 
the history of commodities. Pushing a hypothesis to its l imit helps us 



220 SPATI A L  A R C H ITECTO N ICS 
discover what obstacles co its application exist and what objections to 
it should be raised. Proceeding in the same manner apropos of space, 
we may wonder whether the state will eventual ly produce its own space, 
an  absolute political space. Or whether, a l ternatively, the nation states 
wi l l  one day see their absolute political space disappearing into (and 
thanks to) the world market. Wil l  this last eventual ity occur th rough 
self-destruction ? Will the state be transcended or wil l  i t  wither away ? 
And must it be one or the other, and not, perhaps, both ?

For mil lennia, monumentality took in a l l  the aspects of spatiality that 
we have identified above : the perceived, the conceived, and the lived ; 
representations of space and representational spaces ; the spaces proper 
to each faculty, from the sense of smell to speech ; the gestural and the 
symbolic. Monumental space offered each member of a society an 
image of that membership, an image of his or her socia l  visage. It thus 
constituted a collective mirror more faithfu l  than any personal  one. Such 
a 'recognition effect' has far greater import than the 'mirror effect' of 
the psychoanalysts. Of this socia l  space, which embraced a l l  the above­
mentioned aspects while still according each its proper place, everyone 
partook, and partook ful ly - albeit, natural ly, under the conditions of 
a general ly accepted Power and a genera lly accepted Wisdom. The 
monument thus effected a 'consensus' ,  and th is in the strongest sense of 
the term, rendering it practical and concrete . The element of repression 
in it and the element of exaltation could scarcely be disentangled; or 
perhaps it wou ld be more accurate to say that the repressive element 
was metamorphosed into exaltation. The codifying approach of semi­
ology, which seeks to classify representations, impressions and evo­
cations (as terms in the code of knowledge, the code of personal feelings, 
the symbolic code, or the hermeneutic code ) ,27 is quite unable to cover 
a l l  facets of the monumenta l .  Indeed, i t  does not even come close, for 
it is the residual ,  the irreducible - whatever cannot be classified or 
codified according to ca tegories devised subsequent to production -
which is, here as a lways, the most precious and the most essential , the 
diamond at the bottom of the melting-pot. The use of the cathedral's 
monumental space necessarily entails its supplying answers to a l l  the

questions tha t  assail anyone who crosses the  threshold. For visitors are 
bound to become aware of their own footsteps, and l isten to the noises, 
the singing; they must breathe the incense-laden air, and plunge into a 
particular world, that of s in and redemption ; they wil l  partake of an 
ideology ; they wil l  contemplate and decipher the symbols around them ; 
and they will thus, on the basis of their own bodies, experience a 
total being in a total space. Smal l  wonder that from time immemorial 
conquerors and revolutionaries eager to destroy a society should so often 
have sought to do so by burning or razing that society 's monuments. 
Sometimes, it is true, they contrive to redirect them to their own advan­
tage . Here too, use goes further and deeper than the codes of exchange. 

The most beautifu l  monuments are imposing in their durabi l i ty .  A 
cyclopean wall achieves monumental beauty because it seems eternal ,  
because i t  seems to have escaped t ime. Monumental ity transcends death, 
and hence a lso what is sometimes cal led the 'death instinct'. As both 
appearance and rea lity, this transcendence embeds itself in  the monu­
ment as its i rreducible foundation ;  the lineaments of a temporal i ty over­
whelm anxiety, even - and indeed above all - in funerary monuments. 
A ne plus ultra of art - form so thorough ly denying meaning that death 
itsel f is submerged. The Empress's Tomb in the Taj Mahal bathes in  an 
atmosphere of gracefu lness, whiteness and floral  motifs. Every bit as 
much as a poem or a tragedy, a monument transmutes the fear of the 
passage of time, and anxiety about death ,  into splendour. 

Monumental 'durabi l i ty '  is unable, however, to achieve a complete 
i l lusion. To put it in what pass for modern terms, its credibi l i ty is never 
total .  It replaces a brutal rea l i ty with a materia l ly real ized appearance; 
real ity is changed into appearance. What, after a l l ,  is the durable aside 
from the will to endure ?  Monumental imperishabi l i ty bears the stamp 
of the will to power. Only Will, in  its more elaborated forms - the wish 
for mastery, the wil l  to wil l  - can overcome, or believe it can overcome, 
death. Knowledge itse l f  fai ls  here, shrinking from the abyss. Only 
through the monument, th rough the intervention of the architect as 
demiurge, can the space of death be negated, transfigured into a l iving • 
space which is an extension of the body; this is a transformation, 
however, which serves what religion, (politica l )  power, and knowledge 
have in common. 

In order to define monumental space properly,28 semiological categori­
zation (codifying) and symbolic explanations must be restrained. But 

20 Clearly we arc not concerned here with architectu ral space understood as the preserve 
of a particular  profession within the established socia l  division of labour. 



222 SPAT I A L  ARCH ITECTO N I C S  

' restrained' should not be taken to mean refused or rejected . I am not 
saying that the monument is not the outcome of a sign i fying practice, 
or of a particu lar way of proposing a meaning, but merely that i t  can 
be reduced neither to a language or discourse nor to the categories and 
concepts developed for the study of language. A spatial work (monument 
or architectural project) attains a complex i ty fundamentally different 
from the complexity of a text, whether prose or poetry. As I pointed 
out earlier, what we are concerned with here is not texts but texture. 
We a lready know that a texture is made up of a usua l ly  rather large 
space covered by networks or webs; monuments consti tute the strong 
points, nexuses or anchors of such webs. The actions of social practice 
are expressible but not explicable through discourse ; they are, precisely, 
acted - and not read. A monumental work, l ike a musical one, does 
not have a 's ign ified' (or 'sign ifieds ' ) ;  rather, i t  has a horizon of meaning: 
a specific or indefinite multipl icity of meanings, a sh ifting h ierarchy in 
which now one, now another meaning comes momentarily to the fore, 
by means of - and for the sake of - a particu lar action .  The socia l  and 
polit ical operation of a monumental work traverses the various 'systems' 
and 'subsystems', or codes and subcodes, which constitute and found 
the society concerned. But i t  a lso surpasses such codes and subcodes, 
and impl ies a 'supercoding', in that it tends towards the a l l-embracing 
presence of the total ity . To the degree that there are traces of violence 
and death, negativity and aggressiveness in social practice, the monumen­
tal work erases them and replaces them with a tranqui l  power and 
certitude which can encompass violence and terror. Thus the mortal 
'moment' (or component) of the sign is temporarily abolished in  monu­
mental space. In  and through the work in space, socia l  practice tran­
scends the l imitations by which other 'signifying practices ' ,  and hence 
the other arts, including those texts known as ' l i terary' ,  are bound;  in 
this way a consensus, a profound agreement, is  achieved. A Greek 
theatre presupposes tragedy and comedy, and by extension the presence 
of the city's people and their a l legiance to their heroes and gods. In 
theatrical space, music, choruses, masks, tiering - al l  such elements 
converge with language and actors. A spatial action overcomes conflicts, 
at least momentarily, even though it does not resolve them; it opens a 
way from everyday concerns to collective joy. 

Turmoil is inevitable once a monument loses its prestige, or can only 
retain i t  by means of admitted oppression and repression. When the 
subject - a city or a people - suffers d ispersa l ,  the building and its 
functions come into their own ; by the same token, housing comes to 
prevai l  over residence within that city or amidst that people. The bui lding 



SPATIAL ARCH ITECfO N I CS 223 

has its roots in warehouses, barracks, depots and rental housing. Build­
ings have functions, forms and structures, but they do not integrate the 
formal, functional and structural 'moments' of socia l  practice. And, 
inasmuch as sites, forms and functions are no longer focused and 
appropriated by monuments, the city's contexture or fabric - its s treets, 
its underground levels, its frontiers - unravel, and generate not concord 
but violence. Indeed space as a whole becomes prone to sudden eruptions 
of violence. 

The balance of forces between monuments and buildings has shifted. 
Bui ldings are to monuments as everyday l i fe is to festival, products to 
works, l ived experience to the merely perceived, concrete to stone, and 
so on. What we are seeing here is a new dialectical process, but one 
just as vast as its predecessors. How could the contradiction between 
building and monument be overcome and surpassed ? How might that 
tendency be accelerated which has destroyed monumentality but which 
could well reinstitute it ,  within the sphere of bui ldings itself, by restoring 
the old unity at a h igher level ? So long as no such dialectical transcend­
ence occurs, we can only expect the stagnation of crude interactions 
and intermixtures between 'moments' - in short, a continu ing spatial 
chaos. Under th is dispensation, bui ldings and dwel l ing-places have been 
dressed up in monumental signs:  first their fac;ades, and later their 
interiors. The homes of the moneyed classes have undergone a superficial 
'socia l ization' with the introduction of reception areas, bars, nooks and 
furniture (divans, for instance) which bespeak some kind of erotic l i fe .  
Pa le echoes, in short, of the aristocratic palace or town house. The 
town, meanwhile, now effectively blown apart ,  has been 'privatized' -
no less superficial ly - thanks to urban 'decor' and 'design' ,  and the 
development of fake environments. Instead, then, of a dialectica l process 
with three stages which resolves a contradiction and 'creatively' tran­
scends a confl ictual situation, we have a stagnant opposition whose 
poles at first confront one another ' face to face' ,  then relapse into 
muddle and confusion. 

xv 

There is st i l l  a good deal to be said about the notion of the monument. 
It is especial ly worth emphasizing what a monument i s  not, because this 
will help avoid a number of misconceptions. Monuments should not be 
looked upon as col lections of symbols (even though every monument 
embodies symbols - sometimes archaic and incomprehensible ones ) ,  nor 



224 SPATIAL ARCH ITECTO N I C S  

as chains of  signs (even though every monumental whole is made up of 
signs ) .  A monument is neither an object nor an aggregation of diverse 
objects, even though its 'objectal i ty ' ,  its position as a socia l  object, is 
recal led at every moment, perhaps by the brutal ity of the materia ls or 
masses involved, perhaps, on the contrary, by their gentle qual i ties. It 
is neither a sculpture, nor a figure, nor simply the result of  materia l  
procedures. The indispensable opposi tion between inside and outside, as 
indicated by th resholds, doors and frames, though often underestimated, 
simply does not suffice when it  comes to defining monumental space. 
Such a space is determined by what may take place there, and conse­
quently by what may not take place there (prescribed/proscribed, 
scene/obscene) .  What appears empty may turn out to be fu l l  - as is 
the case with sanctuaries, or with the 'ships' or naves of cathedrals .  
Alternatively, ful l  space may be inverted over an  a lmost heterotopic void 
at the same location ( for instance, vaults, cupolas) . The Taj Mahal ,  for 
instance, makes much play with the fu l lness of swel l ing curves suspended 
in a dramatic emptiness. Acoustic, gestural and ritual movements, 
elements grouped into vast ceremonial unities, breaches opening onto 
l imitless perspectives, chains of meanings - al l  are organized into a 
monumental whole. 

The affective level - which is to say, the level of the body, bound to 
symmetries and rhythms - is transformed into a 'property' of monumen­
tal space, into symbols which are genera l ly intrinsic parts of a pol itico­
rel igious whole, into co-ordinated symbols .  The component elements of 
such wholes a re disposed according to a strict order for the purposes 
of the use of space : some at a first level ,  the level of affective, bodily, 
l ived experience, the level of the spoken word ; some at a second level, 
that of  the perceived, of socio-pol itical s ign ification;  and some at a th i rd 
level , the level of the conceived, where the dissemination of the written 
word and of knowledge welds the members of society into a 'consensus' ,  
and in doing so confers upon them the status of 'subjects ' .  Monumental 
space permits a continual  back-and-forth between the private speech of 
ordinary conversations and the public speech of discourses, lectures, 
sermons, ral lying-cries, and al l  theatrical forms of utterance. 

Inasmuch as  the poet through a poem gives voice to a way of l iving 
( loving, feel ing, thinking, taking pleasure, or suffering) , the experience 
of monumental space may be said to have some similarity to entering 
and sojourning in the poetic world. It is more easily understood, how­
ever, when compared with texts written for the theatre, which are 
composed of dialogues, rather than with poetry or other l i terary texts, 
which are monologues. 



SPAT I A L  A R C H ITECl"O N J CS 225 

Monumental qual i ties are not solely plastic, not to be apprehended 
solely through looking. Monuments are also l iable to possess acoustic 
properties, and when they do not th is detracts from thei r monumental ity .  
Si lence i tse lf, in a place of worsh ip, has i ts music. In cloister or cathedral ,  
space is  measured by the ear :  the sounds, voices and singing reverberate 
in an interplay analogous to that between the most basic sounds and 
tones ; analogous also to the interplay set up when a reading voice 
breathes new l i fe into a wri tten text. Arch itectural volumes ensure a 
correlation between the rhythms that they enterta in (ga i ts, ritual ges­
tures, processions, parades, etc . )  and their musical resonance. It is in 
this way, and at this level, in the non-visible, that bodies find one 
another. Should there be no echo to provide a reflection or acoustic 
mirror of presence, it fa l ls to an object to supply this mediation between 
the inert and the l iving: bells t inkl ing at  the sl ightest breeze, the play of 
fountains and running water, perhaps birds and caged animals .  

Two 'primary processes ' ,  as described by certain psychoanalysts and 
l inguists, might reasonably be expected to operate in  monumental space: 
( 1 )  displacement, implying metonymy, the shift from part to whole, and 
contiguity; and (2) condensation, involving substitution, metaphor and 
simi larity. And, to a degree, this is so. Social space, the space of social 
practice, the space of the socia l  relations of production and of work 
and non-work ( relations which are to a greater or lesser extent codified) 
- this space is indeed condensed in monumental space. The notion of 
'socia l  condenser', as proposed by Russian architects in the 1 920s, has 
a more general appl ication.  The 'properties' of a spatial texture are 
focused upon a single point : sanctuary, throne, seat, presidentia l  chair, 
or the l ike. Thus each monumental space becomes the metaphorical and 
quasi-metaphysical underpinning of a society, this by virtue of a play 
of substitutions in  which the rel igious and political realms symbolically 
(and ceremonial ly) exchange attributes - the attributes of power; in  this 
way the authority of the sacred and the sacred aspect of authority are 
transferred back and forth , mutual ly reinforcing one another in the 
process. The horizontal chain  of s ites in space is thus replaced by vertical 
superimposition, by a hierarchy which fol lows i ts own route to the locus 
of power, whence it will determine the disposition of the sites in question . 
Any object - a vase, a chair, a garment - may be extracted from 
everyday practice and suffer a displacement which wi l l  transform it by 
transferring it into monumental space : the vase wil l  become holy, the 
garment ceremonial ,  the chair  the seat of authority. The famous bar 
which, according to the fol lowers of Saussure, separates signifier from 
signified and desire from its object, is in fact transportable h ither and

thither at the whim of society, as a means of separating the sacred from 
the profane and of repressing those gestures which are not prescribed 
by monumental space - in short, as a means of banishing the obscene. 

All of wh ich has sti l l  not expla ined very much, for what we have said 
applies for a l l  'monumental ity' and does not address the question of 
what particu lar power is in place. The obscene is a general category of 
social practice, and not of signifying processes as such : exclusion from 
the scene is pronounced silently by space itself. 

XVI 

Analysis of social space - in this case, of monumental space - brings 
out many di fferences : what appeared simple at first now emerges as ful l  
of complexities. These are situated neither in the geometrically 
objectified space of squares, rectangles, ci rcles, curves and spi rals, nor 
in the mental space of logical inherence and coherence, of predicates 
bound to substantives, and so on. For they a lso - indeed most 
importantly - involve levels, layers and sedimentations of perception, 
representation, and spatia l  practice which presuppose one another, 
which proffer themselves to one another, and which are superimposed 
upon one another. Perception of the entrance to a monument, or even 
to a bui lding or a simple cabin, constitutes a chain of actions that is no 
less complex than a l inguistic act, utterance, proposition or series of 
sentences. Yet, whatever analogies or correlations may legitimately be 
made between course and discourse, so to speak, these complexities 
cannot be said to be mutually defining or isomorphic:  they are truly 
different. 

The level of  singularities stretches outwards around bodies : 
that is, around each body and around the connections between 
bodies, and extends them into p laces affected by opposing qual i ­
t ies - by the favourable and the unfavourable, say,  or by the 
feminine and the masculine. These qual ities, though dependent 
on the p laces in  question, a re also what confer symbolic power 
on them. This level is governed, though at times in an inverted 
manner, by the laws of symmetry and asymmetry. Places so 
affected - and hence affect- laden, valorized - are not scattered 
through a mental space, indeed they are not separated from one 
another. What bind them together are rhythms - semiological 
differentials .

2 Singularities reappear transformed at another level , at the level 
of generality, in the space of political speech , of order and 
prescription, with its symbolic attributes, which are often 
rel igious, but sometimes simple symbols of power and violence. 
This is the space of activi ty, and hence the space of labour 
divided according to sex, age or group, and the space of com­
munities (vi l lage or town ) .  Here rhythms, bodies and words are 
subordinated to principles of coexistence dictated from above, 
and indeed often written down. 

3 Lastly, the level of singularities also reappears, again modified, 
in the particularities attributed to groups, especia l ly fami l ies, in 
spaces defined as permitted or forbidden .

This analysis leads back to bui ldings ,  the prose of the world as opposed, 
or apposed, to the poetry of monuments. In their pre-eminence, bui ld­
ings, the homogeneous matrix of capitalistic space, successfu l ly combine 
the object of control by power with the object of commercia l  exchange. 
The building effects a brutal condensation of social relationships, as I 
shal l show later in more (economic and political )  detai l .  It embraces, 
and in so doing reduces, the whole paradigm of space : space as domi­
nation/appropriation (where it emphasizes technological domination) ;  
space a s  work and product (where i t  emphasizes the product) ; and 
space as immediacy and mediation (where i t  emphasizes mediations 
and mediators, from technical materiel to the financial  'promoters' of 
construction projects) .  I t  reduces sign ificant oppositions and values, 
among them pleasure and suffering, use, and labour. Such condensation 
of society's attributes is easily discernible in the style of administrative 
buildings from the nineteenth century on, in  schools, ra ilway stations, 
town hal ls ,  pol ice stations or min istries. But displacement is every bit 
as important here as condensation;  witness the predominance of 'ameni­
ties', which are a mechanism for the local ization and 'punctua l ization' 
of activ ities, including leisure pursuits, sports and games . These are 
thus concentrated in specia l ly equipped 'spaces' which are as clearly 
demarcated as factories in the world of work. They supply ' syntagmatic' 
links between activities within social spaces as such - that is, within a 
space which is determined economically by capital, dominated social ly 
by the bourgeoisie, and ruled political ly by the state. 



228 SPATI A L  A R C H I TECTONICS 

It may be asked whether global space is determined by architectonics 
(our discussion of which is about to come to an end and debouch onto 
other analytical perspectives ) .  The answer must be no - and this for 
severa l reasons. First of a l l ,  the global level is dependent upon dialectical 
processes which cannot be reduced to binary oppositions, to contrasts 
and complementarities, or to mirage effects and redupl ications, even 
though such effects or oppositions may wel l be integra l - and integrative 
- components thereof. They are, in other words, necessary but not 
sufficient conditions. The global level mobil izes triads, tripartite conflicts 
or connections .  It will do no harm to reca l l  the most essentia l  of 
these connections now : capitalism cannot be analysed or explained by 
appea ling to such binary oppositions as those between proletariat and 
bourgeoisie, wages and profit, or productive labour and parasiti sm;  
rather, it is comprised of three elements, terms or moments - namely 
land, labour and capita l ,  or in other words rent, wages and profit -
which are brought together in the global unity of surplus value. 

The global level, moreover, has its own mode of existence, and its 
effects a re qual i tatively different from partial effects. Like language, 
global space ( as, for example, that between monuments and buildings, 
the space of  street or square) produces effects, along with that of 
communication, which are contradictory : effects of violence and per­
suasion, of (politica l )  legitimation and delegitimation. Inasmuch as glo­
bal space bears the inscriptions and prescriptions of power, its effective­
ness redounds upon the levels we have been discussing - the levels of 
the archi tectural (monument/building) and the urban. Where global 
space contrives to sign ify, thanks to those who inhabit it, and for them, 
it does so, even in  the 'private' rea lm, only to the extent that those 
inhabitants accept, or have imposed upon them, what is  'publ ic ' .  

And this leads us into another area, another discussion.

From Absolute Space to Abstract 

Space 

I 

To recapitu late: socia l  space, which is at first biomorphic and anthropo­
logica l ,  tends to transcend this immediacy. Nothing disappears com­
pletely, however; nor can what subsists be defined solely in terms of 
traces, memories or rel ics. In space, what came earlier continues to 
underpin what fol lows. The preconditions of socia l  space have their 
own particu lar way of enduring and remaining actual within that space. 
Thus primary nature may persist, a lbeit in a completely acquired and 
false way, within 'second nature' - witness urban real i ty. The task of 
architectonics i s  to describe, ana lyse and explain this persistence, which 
is often evoked in the metaphorical shorthand of strata, periods, sedi­
mentary layers, and so on. It is an  approach, therefore, which embraces 
and seeks to reassemble elements dispersed by the special ized and partial 
discipl ines of ethnology, ethnography, human geography, anthropology, 
prehistory and history, sociology, and so on. 

Space so conceived might be called 'organic' .  In the immediacy of the 
links between groups, between members of groups, and between 'society' 
and nature, occupied space gives direct expression - 'on the ground', 
so to speak - to the relationships upon which social organization is 
founded. Abstraction has very l i tt le place in these relationships, which 
remain on the level of sex, age, blood and, menta l ly, on that of images 
without concepts ( i .e .  the level of speech) .  

Anthropology ha s  shown us how the space occupied by  any  particular 
'primitive' group corresponds to the h ierarchical classification of the 
group's members, and how it serves to render that order always actual ,

This is no less true of a .French, Ital ian or Turkish vi l lage, provided. 
always that note is taken of the role p layed by external factors - by 
markets, by social abstractions (money, etc . ) ,  or by outside political 
authorities. The near order, that of the loca l i ty, and the far, that of the 
state, have of course long ceased to coincide : they either clash or are 
telescoped into one another.2 It is in this sense that 'archi tectonic' 
determinants, along with the space that they comprehend, persist in 
society, ever more radical ly modified but never disappearing completely. 
This underlying continu i ty does not exist solely i n  spatial real ity, but 
also at the representational level .  Pre-existing space underpins not only 
.durable spatia l  arrangements but also representational spaces and their 
'attendant imagery and mythic narratives - i .e. what are often called 
'cultural models' ,  although the term 'culture'  gives rise to a good deal 
of confusion. 

Knowledge fa l l s  into a trap when it makes representations of space 
the basis for the study of ' l i fe' ,  for in doing so it  reduces lived experience. 
The object of knowledge is, precisely, the fragmented and uncertain 
connection between elaborated representations of space on the one hand 
and representationa l  spaces ( along with their underpinnings) on the 
other; and this 'object' implies (and explains)  a subject - that subject 
in whom l ived, perceived and conceived (known) come together with in  
a spatial practice. 

'Our'  space thus remains qual ified (and qual ifying) beneath the sedi­
ments left beh ind by history, by accumulation, by quanti fication . The 
qual ities in question are qual ities of space, not (as latter-day represen­
tation suggests) qual i ties embedded in space. To say that such qual ities 
constitute a 'culture', or 'cultural models' , adds very l i ttle to our under­
standing of the matter. 

Such qual i ties, each of which has i ts own particu lar genesis, its own 
particular date, repose upon specific spatial bases (site, church, temple, 
fortress, etc . )  without which they wou ld have disappeared. Their ulti­
mate foundation, even where it is set aside, broken up, or local ized, i s

FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO ABSTRA CT SPACE 23 1 

nature; this is an i rreducible fact, though nature is hard to define in this 
role as the absolute within - and at the root of - the relative. 

From Rome and the ancient Romans the Christian tradition inherited, 
and carried down into the modern world, a space fi l led with magico­
religious entities, with deities malevolent or benevolent, male or female, 
l inked to the earth or to the subterranean ( the dead ) ,  and all subject to 
the formal isms of rite and ritua l .  Antiquity's representations of space 
have c_oll apsed : the Firmament, the celestial spheres, the Mediterranean 
as centre of  the inhabi ted earth . Jts representational spaces, however, 
have survived: the realm of the dead, chthonian and tel luric forces, the 
depths _ _  and the heigh_ts. Art - painting, scu lpture, architecture - has 
drawn3nd_continues to araw on these sources . The high culture of the 
Middle Ages (equivalent to the low culture of the modern world) had 
its epic space, the space of the romanceros or of the Round Table,  which 
straddled dream and real ity ;  the space of cavalcades, crusades and 
tourneys, where the distinction between war and festival becomes 
unclear. This space, with its continual  appeals to minor local dei ties, is 
hard to disentangle (though it is in  fact d istinct) from the organizational 
and j uridical space inherited from the Roman world. As for the lyrical 
space of legend and myth, of forests, lakes and oceans, i t  vies with the 
bureaucratic and polit ical space to which the nation states have been 
giving form since the seventeenth century. Yet i t  also completes that 
space, supplying it with a 'cultural ' side. Th is romantic representational 
space was derived, via the Romantic movement, from the Germanic 
barbarians who overth rew the Roman world and carried out the West's 
first great agrarian reform. 

The process whereby an existing form leads back to immediacy via 
'historica l '  mediations is a reverse repetition of the original  formative 
process. Conflict is not rare between representational spaces and the 
symbolic systems they encompass, and this is  notably true as between 
the imaginary realm of the Graeco-Roman (or J udaeo-Christian )  tra­
dition and a Romantic imagery of nature .  This i s  in  addition to the 
conflicts which ordinarily exist between the rational and the symbolic. 
Eve·n today urban space appears in two l ights : on the one hand it is  
replete with places which are holy or damned, devoted to the male 
principle or the female, rich in  fantasies or phantasmagorias ;  on the other 
hand it  is rational, state-dominated and bureaucratic, i ts monumenta l i ty 
degraded and obscured by traffic of every kind, including the traffic of 
information. I t  must therefore be grasped in two different ways: as 
absolute (apparent} within the relative ( real ) .  

What is the fantasy o f  art? To lead out of what i s  present, out of 



232 F R O M  ABSO LUTE SPACE T O  ABSTRACT SPACE 
what is  close, out of representations of space, into what is further off, 
into nature, into symbols, into representational spaces. Gaudi did for 
architecture what Lautreamont did for poetry : he put it th rough the 
bath of madness. He pushed the Baroque as far as i t  would go, but he 
did not do so on the basis of accepted doctrines or categor izations . As 
locus of a risible consecration, one which makes a mockery of the 
sacred, the Sagrada Familia causes modern space and the archaic space 
of nature to corrupt one another. The flouting of established spatial 
codes and the eruption of a natural and cosmic ferti l i ty generate an 
extraordinary and dizzying ' infinitization ' of meaning. Somewhere short 
of accepted symbolisms, but beyond everyday meanings, a sanctifying 
power comes into play which is neither that of the state, nor that of the 
Church, nor that of the artist, nor that of theological div in i ty , but rather 
that of a naturalness boldly identified with divine transcendence. The 
Sagrada Familia embodies a modernized heresy which disorders rep­
resentations of space and transforms them into a represen tational space 
where palms and fronds are expressions of the divine. The outcome 
is a virtual eroticization, one based on the enshrinement of a cruel, 
sexual-mystical pleasure which i s  the opposite, but a lso the reverse, of 
joy. What is  obscene is modern ' rea l i ty ' ,  and here it is so designated by 
the staging - and by Gaudi as stage-manager. 

ln the extensions and prol iferations of cities, housing is the guarantee 
of reproductivity, be it biological ,  social or pol i tica l .  Society - that is, 
capital ist society - no longer total izes its elements, nor seeks to ach ieve 
such a total integration through monuments. Instead i t  strives to distil 
its essence into bui ldings .  As a substitute for the monumentality of the 
ancient world, housing, under the control of a state which oversees both 
production and reproduction, refers us from a cosmic ' naturalness' (air, 
water, sun, 'green space' ) ,  which is at once arid and fictit ious, to 
genitality - to the family, the family unit and biological reproduction. 
Being commutable, permutable and interchangeable, spaces d i ffer i n  
their degree of 'participation' in nature (they may also reject o r  destroy 
nature ) .  Fami l ia l  space, l inked to naturalness through genita lity, is the 
guarantor of meaning as well as of social (spatia l )  practice. Shattered 
by a host of separations and segregations, social unity is able to reconsti­
tute i tself at the level of the family unit, for the purposes of, and by 
means of, genera l ized reproduction. The reproduction of production 
relations continues apace amid (and on the basis of) the destruction of 
socia l  bonds to the extent that the symbol ic space of ' fami l iarity' (family 
l i fe, everyday l i fe ) ,  the only such space to be 'appropriated', continues 
to hold sway. What makes this possible is the way in which ' famil iar' 



FROM ABSO LUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 233 

everyday practice is  constantly referring from representations of space 
(maps and plans, transport and communications systems, information 
conveyed by images and signs) to representational space (nature, 
fert i l i ty ) .  Reference from the one to the other, and back again, constitutes 
an osci l la tion which plays an ideological role but replaces any clear-cut 
ideology. In  this sense space is a trap - and all the more so in  that it 
flees immediate consciousness. This may help account for the passivi ty 
of the 'users' of space. Only a smal l  'e l i te' see the trap and manage to 
sidestep it . The e l i tist character of some oppositional movements and 
socia l  critiques should perhaps be viewed in this l ight. Meanwhile, 
however, the social control of space weighs heavy indeed upon a l l  those 
consumers who fai l  to reject the famil iari ty of everyday l i fe. 

Sti l l ,  that fami l iariry tends to break apart .  Absolute and relat ive 
are themselves prone ro dissolut ion. Fami l iarity is misdirected and/or 
fetishized, a l ternately hal lowed and profaned, at once power's proxy 
and a form of powerlessness, and a fictitious locus of gratification .  Nor 
does it have any great immuniry to all these contradictions. 

Residua in  space thus make possible not just dual ideological i l lusions 
(opacity/transparency )  but a lso much more complex references and sub­
stitutions. I t  is for this reason that socia l  space may be described and 
explained, at least partial ly, in terms of an intentional signifying process, 
in terms of sequential or stratified codes and in  terms of imbricate 
forms. Dia lectical movements 'superclassify' and 'supercode' overlapping 
categorizations and logical connections. (The movements of this kind 
which concern us for the moment are immediacy/mediation and/or 
relative/absolute. ) 

Symbols and symbolisms are much-discussed topics, but they are 
rarely discussed intel l igently. It is too often forgotten that some if not 
al l  symbols had a material and concrete existence before coming to 
symbol ize anything. The labyrinth, for i nstance, was original ly a mi l itary 
and political structure designed to trap enemies inextricably in a maze. 
It served too as palace, fortification, refuge and shelter before coming 
to stand for the womb. And i t  was even later that the labyrinth acquired 
a further symbolic role as modulator of the dichotomy between presence 
and absence. Another example is the zodiac, which represents the hor­
izon of the herder set down in an immensiry of pasture :  a figure, then, 
of demarcation and orientation .  Init ia l ly - and fundamentally - absolute 
space has a relative aspect. Relative spaces, for their part, secrete the 
absolute. 



234 FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 

II 

The cradle of absolute space - its origin, i f  we are to use that term -
is a fragment of agro-pastoral space, a set of places named and exploited 
by peasants, or by nomadic or semi-nomadic pastora l ists. A moment 
comes when, through the actions of masters or conquerors, a part of 
th is space is assigned a new role, and henceforward appears as transcen­
dent, as  sacred ( i .e .  inhabited by divine forces ) ,  as magical and cosmic. 
The paradox here, however, is that i t  continues to be perceived as part 
of nature. Much more than that, its mystery and its sacred (or cursed) 
character are attributed to the forces of nature, even though it is the 
exercise of  political power therein which has in fact wrenched the area 
from its natural context, and even though its new meaning is entirely 
predicated on that action. 

Around this nucleus of an organic coherence, which is the centre of 
t ime because i t  is the centre of space, is  distributed, more or less 
'harmoniously' , an a lready dense population. Actual ly, however, har­
mony between the nucleus and its surroundings only occurs if the 
circumstances are right, only by the grace of 'historical '  chance .  In nearly 
all cases, however, the political and rel igious centre is  marked by the 
conflict between town and country, between urban space and agrarian 
space. The very rites of proh ibition and protection that confer rel igious 
and magical power upon central spaces are responses to rea l  threats 
from without. 

The town and its site l ive off the surrounding country, exacting tribute 
therefrom both in the form of agricultural produce and in the form of 
work in  the fields. The town has a two-sided relationship to the country, 
however: first as an entity which draws off the surplus product of rural 
society, and secondly as an entity endowed with the administrative and 
mi l i ta ry capacity to supply protection. Sometimes one of these roles 
predominates, sometimes the other: by appropriating rural space the 
town takes on a real i ty which i s  sometimes 'maternal '  (it stores, stocks 
or profitably exchanges a portion of the surplus product, later returning 
a lesser or greater fraction of it to the original  producers) and sometimes 
'masculine' ( i t  protects while exploiting - or exploits while protecting; 
it holds the power; it oversees, regu lates and on occasion - as in  the 
East - organ izes agricu lture, taking responsibi l ity for major projects of 
dyke construction, i rrigation, drainage, etc. ) .  

Thus the town - urban space - ha s  a symbiotic relationship with that 



FROM ABSO LUTE S PACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 235 

rural space over which ( i f  often with much difficulty) it holds sway. 
Peasants are prone to restlessness, and as for herders, nomadic or semi­
nomadic, the towns have a lways found i t  hard to contain them - they 
are, in fact, ever potential conquerors of the town. 

The city state thus establishes a fixed centre by coming to constitute 
a hub, a privileged focal point, surrounded by peripheral a reas which 
bear its stamp. From this moment on, the vastness of pre-existing space 
appears to come under the thra l l  of a divine order. At the same time 
the town seems to gather in everyth ing which surrounds it, including 
the natural and the divine, and the earth's evi l and good forces. As 
image of the universe (imago mundi) , urban space is reflected in the 
rural space that i t  possesses and indeed in  a sense contains . Over 
and above its economic, religious and political content, therefore, this 
relationship a lready embodies an element of symbolism, of image-and­
reflection : the town perceives itself in i ts double, in its repercussions or 
echo; in self-affirmation, from the height of its towers, i ts gates and its 
campaniles, i t  contemplates itself in the countryside that i t  has shaped 
- that is  to say, in its work . The town and its surroundings thus 
constitute a texture. 

As guardian of civic unity and hence of the bond between all members 
of the city, including the country people, absolute space condenses, 
harbours (or at  any rate seems to harbour) a l l  the diffuse forces in play. 
Do the forces of death precede the forces of l i fe, or vice versa ? The 
question is a purely abstract one, for the two go hand in hand. Civic 
unity binds the l iv ing to the dead just as i t  binds the l iving to one 
another, especial ly in those instances, which are frequent, where the city 
as concentrated wealth is concretely embodied by a monarch . Absolute 
space is thus also and above al l  the space of death, the space of death's 
absolute power over the living (a power of which their sole sovereign 
partakes) .  Tombs and funerary monuments belong, then, to absolute 
space, and this in thei r dual aspect of formal beauty and terrifying 
content. A pre-eminence of formal beauty in such spaces leads to the 
mausoleum, the prestigious but empty monument; that of a terrorizing 
polfrica l content, on the other hand, gives rise to haunted places, places 
peopled by the l iving dead. The Christian cemetery is j ust such a place 
- though it must be said for cemeteries that they do democratize immor­
tality. 

Here and there, in every society, absolute space assumes meanings 
addressed not to the intellect but to the body, meanings conveyed by 
threats, by sanctions, by a continual putting-to-the-test of the emotions. 



236 F R O M  A BSOLUTE SPACE T O  ABSTRACT SPACE 

This space is ' l ived' rather than conceived, and i t  is a representational 
space rather than a representation of space ;  no sooner is it concep­
tual ized than its significance wanes and vanishes. 

Absolute space does have dimensions, though they do not correspond 
to dimensions of abstract (or Eucl idean )  space. Directions here have 
symbol ic force : left and right, of course - but above al l  h igh and low. 
I spoke earlier of three level s :  surface, heights, depths - or, in other 
words, the earth , as worked and ruled by humanity;  the peaks, the 
heavens ;  and abysses or gaping holes. These levels enter the service of 
absolute space, but each does so in  its own way. Altitude and vertica l i ty 
are often invested with a specia l  significance, and sometimes even with 
an absolute one (knowledge, authority, duty), but such meanings vary 
from one society or 'cul ture' to the next. By and la rge, however, horizon­
tal space symbolizes submission, vertical space power, and subterranean 
space death. These associations offer unequivocal responses to demands 
for meaning, but they need tempering by some notion of ambiguity: 
nowhere is death perceived as 'pure death ' ,  or as 'pure' nothingness ; 
nor are power, submission, knowledge, wisdom, and so forth, ever 
apprehended as 'pure' .  Thus the very concept of abstract space is self­
correcting. Even i n  this mitigated form, though , abstract space reta ins 
its essential traits . For those i n  its vicin i ty ,  this is the true space, the space 
of truth, and of truth 's sudden eruptions (wh ich destroy appearances -
that is to say, other times and other spaces ) .  Whether empty or ful l ,  
absolute space is therefore a highly activated space, a receptacle for, 
and stimulant to, both social  energies and natural forces. At once 
myth ica l  and proximate, it generates times, cycles. Considered in itself 
- 'absolutely' - absolute space is located nowhere. It has no place 
because it embodies all places, and has a strictly symbolic existence. 
This is  what makes it s imi lar to the fictitious/real space of langu;ige, 
and of that mental space, magical ly ( imaginari ly )  cut off from the spatial 
rea lm, where the consciousness of the 'subject' - or 'self-consciousness' 
- cakes form. Absolute space is always at the disposal of priestly castes. 
I t  consecrates, and consecration metaphysical ly identifies any space with 
fundamental ly  holy space: the space of a sanctuary is absolute space, 
even in the smal lest temple or the most unpretentious vi l lage church . 
The space of tombs, for its part, unless it conta ins a god or a monarch, 
is  analogous merely to the spaces of b irth, death or oblivion. Absolute 
space, being by definition religious as wel l as polit ical, impl ies the 
existence of rel igious institutions which subject it to the two major 
mechanisms of identification and imitation. These mental categories, 
destined to become chose of imagination and reflective thought, first

appear as spatial forms. The materi a l  extension of absolute space occurs 
by virtue of these processes, to the benefit of priestly castes and the 
polit ical power they exercise or serve. 

Being ritual ly affixable to any place and hence also detachable there­
from,  the characteristic 'absolute' requires an identifying mark. It there­
fore generates forms, and forms accommodate it .  Such forms are micro­
cosms of  the universe : a square (the mandala ) ,  a circle or sphere, a 
triangle, a rational volume occupied by a divine principle, a cross, and 
so on. 

In its ancient Greek version, absolute space may contain  nothing. The 
temple (the Parthenon, say) is divided up into the portico or naos, the 
sanctuary or pronaos, and the opisthodomos, which is the secret dwell­
ing-place of  divinity - and of thought .  It has aspects but no fac;ade. The 
frieze girdles the entire edifice. Visitors may walk all the way around, 
but the p lace is not an 'object' that can be grasped otherwise than by 
means of a thought-process capable of perceiving i t  as a tota lity, and 
hence as endowed with meaning. Curves appear - intentional ly - to be 
straight :  the lines of the columns, as of  the entablature, have a curvature 
which is ' imperceptible' because the eye compensates for it. Thus for 
the Greeks curves are as it were reabsorbed by straight l ines, which in 
the process lose their rigidi ty, and are softened, while continuing to 
obey the dictates of the Logos. For it must be remembered that these 
adjustments cal led for meticu lous calcu lation . 3  

Vol ume perceived and conceived, clarified by the l ight of the sun as  
by the l ight  of understanding, is the Cosmos in  epitome. This, whether 
that  volume is vacant or occupied by thought. Consider the agora. It is 
part of  absolute space, both rel igious and political - and i t  concentrates 
that space. The agora is empty - and must remain empty so that the 
ecclesia, or assembly of free cit izens, may be held there. The Roman 
Forum, by contrast, contains state monuments, the tribune, temples, 
rostra, and later a prison : i t  is a place occupied and fi l led by objects 
and things, and as such it stands in contradiction to the space of the 
Greeks. 

Though we have arrived at i t  by another path, here we may once 
more discern and identify an idea which i s  the key to the Greek 'miracle' 
- the simple idea of unity. 'Among the Greeks,' wrote Viollet-le-Duc, 
'Construction and Art are one and the same thing; the form and the

York : Dover, 1 960),  book I I I ,  ch .  3 ,  section 6 et seq. (pp. 80ff) , along with the 
accompanying 'Vitruvian tables ' .  



23 8 FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO A BSTRACT SPACE 
structu re are intimately connected In the space of the Romans, 
by contrast, there was a separation, a rift :  'we have the construction, 
and we have the form which clothes that construction, and is often 
independent of i t ' . 4  The Romans organized volumes in such a way as 
to fulfi l  some particular function, whether in  the basi l ica or in  the baths; 
the use of constructed masses was clearly distinct from the presentation 
of surfaces or decoration - the elements of which were ornamental 
additions to heavy masses of bricks or rubble (i .e. cement and a sort of 
concrete ) .  The 'orders ' invented by the Greeks (Doric, Ionic and 
Corinthian)  were the structure itsel f; the notion of 'order' embraced 
that of structure, so that the external appearance and the composition 
(or structure) of Greek bui ldings are indistinguishable from each other: 
each contains and revea ls the other. It was impossible, according to 
Viol let-le-Duc, who brought a technician 's  viewpoint to the development 
of Hegel 's ideas on Greek art and arch itecture, to strip a Greek temple 
of its 'order' without destroying the monument itself. The order was 
not decorative, nor were the columns and the capitals .  'The Greek orders 
are none other than the structure itself, to which that form was given 
which was most appropriate to its function .  In the orders adopted from 
the Greeks the Romans saw only a decoration which might be removed, 
omitted, displaced, or replaced by someth ing else. '5 

In the West, therefore, absolute space has assumed a strict form: that 
of volume carefu l ly measured, empty, hermetic, and constitutive of the 
rational unity of Logos and Cosmos. It embodies the simple, regulated 
and methodical principle or coherent stabil ity, a principle operating 
under the banner of political religion and applying equally to mental 
and to social l i fe .  This assumes materia l  form in monuments which 
govern time by means of well co-ordinated materia ls  whose objective 
ordering - in terms of vertical pressures and physical mass - successful ly 
achieves both a natural and a rational  equi l ibrium. 

· 

To the extent that the Greek mind perceives space in order to shape 
it, perhaps the ancient Greeks were essential ly sculptors. As Hegel 
pointed out, they were able to take natural materials, first wood and 
then stone, and endow them with meanings which rendered concrete 
and practical such social abstractions as assembly, shelter and protection. 
The shaping of nature, and hence of space (which Hegel sti l l  saw as

external to mental or social acts) so as to represent and symbolize gods, 
heroes, kings and leaders - such is the basic sense of Greek art. And this 
is especi al ly true of sculpture, whether under its inorganic ( arch itectural )  
aspect or under its organic one (the work o f  the scu lptor) .  

Do we then have here the  founding principle of Western culture ?  In  
part, yes  - but  in part  on ly .  The Greek unification of form with function 
and structure precluded any separation. But the Romans split up what 
had thus been unified, reintroducing di fference, relativity, and varying 
(and hence civi l )  aims into a Greek space in which the fusion of pol itics 
and religion on the one hand and mathematical rational i ty on the other 
had been able to effect a metaphysical (eternal )  closure. The city state, 
at once beautifu l ,  true and good, identified mental with social, h igher 
symbolisms with immediate real i ty, and thought with action, in a way 
that was destined to degenerate. The apotheosis of ancient Greek civi l i­
zation pointed the way for its decl ine, as Nietzsche clearly saw. By 
contrast, did Roman diversity, governed as it was by an external con­
straining principle rather than by an internal unity, contain the seeds of 
further growth ? It seems reasonable to suppose so. 

Was the Greek spatial habitus, inseparably social and mental, a suf­
ficient basis for the formulation of the essential concepts of form, 
function and structure ? Undoubtedly, since Greek philosophy essayed 
such a formulation explicitly, s ince the phi losophers took it in hand. 
This  is even truer of Aristotle than of Plato : whereas in Plato the unity 
in question shines with the brightness of ontological transcendence, in 
Aristotle i t  becomes a theory of discourse, of classification, of coherence. 
No sooner have they crossed the th reshold of their formulation than 
these concepts detach themselves from one another: the conceived separ­
ates from the l ived, the habitus from the intuitus, and their presupposed 
unity is broken . In the Roman intuitus, on the other hand, unity in a 
sense enjoys a certa in leeway, in that in each instance - baths being the 
perfect example - form, structure and function are subordinated to a 
principle both materia l  (answering a need) and juridical (or civic), which 
dictates socia l  use. Roman space, though encumbered by objects (as in 
the Forum) ,  was a productive space. It was also a freer space, as witness 
the greater use of curves. The unity of the law, of property, or of the 
city state, being l ived and perceived rather than conceived, was never 
immediately shattered. In the case of ancient Rome, need appears to 
have been an almost total determinant :  both the baths and the vi l la 
incorporate responses to every demand of the bodies and minds of free 
- and rich - citizens. 

It is indisputable that slaves made i t  possible for the city state to exist. 



240 FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 

The claim made on the basis of this fact alone by a sel f-proclaimedly 
Marxist phi losophy of h istory which posits a specific 'mode of pro­
duction' founded on sl avery succeeds only, however, in rendering unin­
telligible the rea l ities of that c i ty state, of Athens or Rome, of the 
Logos/Cosmos, and of Roman Law. 

Is there a link between the space the Greeks invented and their 
inventions in respect of the alphabet, alphabetic script, graphics, arithme­
tic, geometry, and so on? Perhaps so, but this can in  any event represent 
only a subsidiary aspect of their habitus. Furthermore, it would surely 
be unjust and specious to restrict Greek invention to the invention of a 
cosmological space. Absolute space always gives rise to diverse forms, 
and i t  is not at all clear that  some of  these may be attri buted to 
reason and the rest to myth (or unreason) .  One response to the Greek 
Logos/Cosmos, for instance, was the labyrinth, whose symbolism 
restores (at a local level ) the priority of the origina l  mystery, of the 
maternal principle, of a sense of envelopment, and of tempora l cycles.6

nature, resides in the religious signifier. Are there grounds for discrimi­
nating between the two? No - because at the time with which we are 
concerned symbolisms and signs had not yet separated. The 'decoding' 
of space by means of i ts associated time was sti l l  brought about by acts, 
by ceremonial - specifical ly, by the Greeks' processions and ' theories' .  
Being ritual ,  gestural and 'unconscious' - but a lso real - decoding was 
part of the use of a space of this kind and of its image. We must avoid 
attributing to an ancient Greek cl imbing up to the Parthenon the attitude 
of  a tourist 'reading' or 'decoding' the prospect before him in terms of 
his feel ings, knowledge, rel igion or national ity. Here, at the dawn of 
Western civil ization, time contained the spatial code, and vice versa .  
There was as yet no poss ib i l ity of displacement into aestheticism, of co­
optation of emotions or of ' l ived experience' by moral ity, or of any 
such 'decodings' imposed upon works which were sti l l  experienced and 
perceived in an unmediated fashion . The concepts of intuitus and habitus 
are used here in order to avoid an anachronistic appl ication of categories 
of a later time, generated subsequently by the intellectus, and hence to 
obviate misunderstandings and misapprehensions. 7 So long as time and 
space remain inseparable, the meaning of each was to be found in the 
other, and this immediately ( i .e .  without intel lectual  mediation) . 

Absolute space did not govern the private space of family and indivi­
dual. But  this did not mean that private space was left a great deal of 
freedom. Absolute space enterta ined no distinction between publ ic a nd 
private, and only incl uded the so-ca lled private realm to the degree that 
this had its own religious or pol i tical status (home, household ) .  Its 
freedom was a weak one - the freedom of  houses or dwel l ings to cluster, 
with varying degrees of humil ity, around places invested with high (or 
low) significance. 

In this respect too the Roman organization of space left more room 
for diversity. But at what cost ?

themes of  the depths ( Inferno) and the heights (Paradise ) ,  a l though in 
doing so he displayed a measure of disdain for surfaces, for the super­
ficial - a bias which had to be corrected later (by Nietzsche) .  Evocation 
of the d ichotomy between the shadows and the l ight, between diabol ica l  
and divine, continued right down to Hugo's subl ime rhetoric. Relation­
ships of this sort between space and language have indeed undergone 
vicissitudes which are sti l l l i ttle known. 

First among phi losophers to do so, Heidegger, in  Sein und Zeit, 
subjected the mundus to examination as image, as symbol, as myth. 
And - as place. He approached the 'world' more as a phi losopher than 
as a historian, an anth ropologist, or an analyst of societies. 

The mundus: a sacred or accursed place in the middle of the Italiot 
townsh ip. A pit, original ly - a dust hole, a public rubbish dump. Into 
it were cast trash and fi lth of every kind, along with those condemned 
to death, and any newborn baby whose father decl ined to ' ra ise' it (that 
is, an infant wh ich he did not l i ft from the ground and hold up above 
his head so that it might be born a second time, born in a social as well 
as a biological sense ) .  A pit, then, 'deep' above all in meaning. It 
connected the city, the space above ground, land-as-soil and land-as­
territory, to the hidden, clandestine, subterranean spaces which were 
those of fertil i ty and death, of the beginning and the end, of birth and 
buria l .  (Later, in Christian times, the cemetery would have a comparable 
function . )  The pit was also a passageway through which dead souls 
could return to the bosom of the earth and then re-emerge and be 
reborn .  As locus of time, of births and tombs, vagina of the nurturing 
earth-as-mother, dark corridor emerging from the depths, cavern open­
ing to the light, estuary of h idden forces and mouth of the realm of 
shadows, the mundus terrified as i t  glorified. In its ambiguity it encom­
passed the greatest foulness and the greatest purity, l i fe and death, 
fertil ity and destruction, horror and fascination. 'Mundus est immun­
dus. ' 

Might a psychoanalysis of space account for this strange and powerful 
presence-absence ? Undoubtedly, but does it not make more sense, 
instead of engaging in a posteriori rationalizations of that kind, to 
envision a slow process of  'historical '  secretion ,  a laying-down and 
superimposition of strata of interpretation, along with their a ttendant 
rites and myths, occurring as the Ital iots loca l ized and focused their 
fears in the abyssal realm ? That a void should be placed at the centre, 
and indeed at the centre of the conception of the 'world' ,  is surely too 
strange a fact to be expla ined solely in  terms of psychic real i ties -

particu larly when one thinks of the future whose seeds this represen­
tational space contained. 

Rome was itself the exorcist of the forces of the underworld, chal leng­
ing those forces by representing them in a graspable manner. The Eternal 
City thus incorporated nature into its (mil itary, j uridical and political) 
order by means of a figurative process. The notion of the citizen-soldier, 
ch ief and father, did not exclude a role for femininity in the space of 
the city, either in representation or in real ity .  If the mundus played a 
part in the formation of the Roman mind it was an inverse and coroll ary 
one: the figure of the Father. The Father predominated; he became what 
he was : chief, political soldier, and hence Law or Right (as imposed on 
the vanquished in the ordering of v ictory : the sharing-out of booty and 
the reassignment of places - primari ly land ) .  The Pater-Rex did not 
have a passive relationship to the world ;  rather, he reorganized it  
according to his power and rights, Property and Patrimony, jus utendi 
et abutendi - the l imits of which were set not by the 'being' of others 
but rather by the rights of those among the others who partook of the 
same power. TI1e Pater-Rex_,__l_e_ter Imper'!!_C>_G_ a_t once magistrate and

In this way arose the spatial ( socia l )  and mental arrangements which 
would give rise to Western society (and its ideologies) - to wit, (Roman) 
law, the notion of the Law, and the notions of Patrimony and of juridical 
and moral Paternity. 

Paternity's imp.osition-,.Qf its juridical law (t_he Law) on maternity 
promoted abstraction to the rank of a law of thought. Abstraction was 
introduced - and- presup_Eosed - by the Father's dominion over the soil, 
o�essions, over chi ldren, over servants _'111.d slaves, and over 
wo;;;n .  Assigned- fo-tlie ·feminine sphere were immediate experience, 
th�production of l i fe (which was, to begin with, inextricably bound 
upwith agricultural production) ,  pleasure and pain, the earth , and the 
abyss below. Patriarchal power was inevitably accompanied by the 
i�position of a faw of signs upon nature through writing, through 
insgiptions - through stone. The shift from a maternal principle (which 
would retain  its importance in the sphere of kinship relations) to the 
rule of paternity implied the establishment of a specific mental and 
social space; with the rise of private ownership of  the land came the 
need to divide it up in accordance with abstract principles that would 
govern both property l ines and the status of property-holders.

as a n  imago mundi, assembling and integrating elements in the vicinity

which would otherwise have had discrete existences . Inserted into nature, 
occupying i ts own site, in a wel l -defined situation clearly distinguishable 
from the surroundings, i t  gave rise to a particular representation of 
space. The way citizens 'thought' thei r city was not as one space among 
others but instead as something vaster :  the city constitu ted thei r rep­
resentation of space as a whole, of the earth, of the world. Within the 
c ity, on the other hand, representationa l  spaces would develop : women, 
servants, s laves, chi ldren - all had their own times, thei r own spaces . 
The free citizen - or political soldier - envisioned the order of the world 
as spatial ly embodied and portrayed in  his city .  The mi l i tary camp, 
being an instrumental space, answered to a different order (a rectangular, 
strictly symmetrica l space, organized according to cardo and 
decumanus) .  

The founding of Rome - in the traditiona l  account at least - was 
effected in  a distinctly ritual manner. The founder, Remus, described a 
circle with his plough, thus subtracting a space from nature and investing 
it with a political meaning. Everything in this foundation story - the 
detai ls  of which are immateria l  for our purposes - is at once symbolic 
and practica l ;  real i ty and meaning, the immediate and the abstract, a re 
one. 

Everything suggests that the space of the Romans was apprehended 
and constructed in accordance with a d i recting intuitus . Orbis and 
urbs : always the c ircular, non-geometric form. The resulting rational ity, 
whether spatial or juridical, is detectable everywhere in the essential and 
most concrete creations of the Roman mind:  vault, arch, circle (circus, 
circulus ) - even the Roman toga, which, in some periods at any rate, 
was cut by simply opening a hole for the head in a round piece of 
materia l .  lntuitus here - as opposed to habitus - does not designate a 
theoretical intuition of a basically intellectual nature, but rather a prac­
tice, a spatial practice, mobil ized by (equal ly spatia l )  representations. 

A vis itor to Rome curious about the genesis of this space would do 
well to consider not only the Rome of marble but also the Rome of 
brick ; to inspect not only the Col iseum and the Forum, for al l  that they 
are rich in significance, but to pay carefu l attention too to the Pantheon, 
and this without l ingering before the marble fa1Yade. The interior repro­
duces the world itself, as it emerges in and through the city, opening to 
the celest ia l powers, welcoming al l  gods and embracing a l l  p laces. 
The vis itor should ignore h is  guidebook long enough to analyse the 
construction of this space, with its prodigiously interlaced curves and 
entangled archwork ( load-bearing or not) . What Rome offers is  an image 
that engenders (or produces) space. What space ? Specifical ly, the space 



FROM A BSO LUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 245 

of power. Pol i tical space is not establ ished solely by actions (with 
material violence generating a place, a legal order, a legis lation) :  the 
genesis of a space of this kind also presupposes a practice, images, 
symbols, and the construction of bui ldings, of towns, and of local ized 
social relationships. 

The paradoxical fact is that this intuitus, in a sophisticated and 
impoverished form, was destined to become a habitus. A representation 
of space embodied in stone, in the city, in paternal istic law, in the 
Empire, wou ld be transformed into a representational space, submerged 
into a rediscovered, degenerate mundus - a subterranean and hell ish 
abyss. And this representational space would in turn become Christiani­
ty's ' foundation' - and its basic resource. Th is occurred during the long 
decl ine of the Empire and the city .  As Augustine, that barbarian of 
genius, would put it, 'Mundus est immundus . '  

Here, in summary ,  are those aspects o f  Rome and the Roman spirit 
that an analytic approach enables us to discern .

These th ree levels of determination correspond, within an overal l  uni ty ,  
to  the  perceived, the conceived, and  the d irectly experienced (or ' lived ' ) .  
In  and  through a spatial practice, refined in the course of a h istory, an  
intuitus was  transformed into a habitus by  means of a process first of  
consol idation, then of degeneration. During th i s  process too, and after 
it, the intellectus made its appearance in the conceptual iz ing discourse 
of Vitruvius, as also of a variety of other authors ( for instance, Cicero, 
Seneca ) .  The triad perceived-conceived-l ived, along with what is 
denoted and connoted by these three terms, contributes to the production 
of space through interactions which metamorphose the original intuitus 
into a quasi-system : the vault and i ts magic, the arch, or the aqueduct. 
In the case of Rome, organization, thought  and the production of space 
went together, indeed almost hand in hand. And they did so not under 
the sign of the Logos but under the s ign of the Law. 

IV 

Christianity was to thrive on a play on words : 'Mundus est immundus' 
(which was closely bound up with another, just as celebrated and j ust 
as sophisticated, the play on the Logos and the Word) .  As for the 
phi losophy of la ter times, the phi losophy of Christian society, it thrived 
on the Augustinian dichotomy between time and space (or between 
subject and object ) ,  with its deva luation of the latter.9 

Closer to modernity, and thanks to Marx's influence, a tendency 
emerged to overestimate the economic sphere, either by identi fying it 
with history (so-ca l led h istorical mater ia l ism) or else by opposing it to 
history (ordinary economism). In either case, history as the precondition 
and underpinning of the economic realm was misapprehended. What 
then of  the Logos, and the logic, of the Greeks ? What  of the Romans' 
Law, and laws ?  Their status remained b lurred, fetishized by some and 
discredited by others. And yet they continued to engender practice, for 
they were not mere ideologies. Logic is an integral part of knowledge, 
as law is of praxis. To confine these categories to anthropology, or 
purely and simply to h istoricity, is hardly a satisfactory solution . Their 
ambiguity would be diminished, however, if reflective thought were to 
take space into account. By 'space', however, I mean to say 'rea l '  space 
- not an abstract, purified, or emptied-out space, but space in its 
concrete modal i ties. Were logic and law not original ly forms of spatial

organization, forms which presupposed and embodied representations 
of space and representational spaces ? 

It is indeed curious in more than one respect that 'we' Westerners, 
inheritors of an  exhausted tradition, and members of a society, culture 
and civi l ization that 'we' scarcely know how to characterize ( is it capi­
talism ? Judaeo-Christianity? both of these ? a 'culture of non-body' ? a 
society at once - and contradictori ly - permissive and repressive ? a 
system of bureaucratica l ly managed consumption ? )  should consider our­
selves closer to the Logos and Cosmos of the Greeks than to the Roman 
world - a world by which, nevertheless, we are deeply haunted. 

The Greek polis, with its acropolis and agora, came into being through 
a synoecism, a unification of vi l lages , upon a hi l l top. Its birth was 
attended by the clear l ight of day. The sea was never far away, with al l  
i ts  resources. The unknown, the far-off, dangerous but not inaccessible, 
were st imulants at once, and inextricably, to curiosity, imagination and 
thought. 

Something which resulted, here as elsewhere, from an encounter and 
a practice, had enigmatic and marvellous qual i ties bestowed upon it  by 
a la ter rhetoric. The Greek city did not exorcize the forces of the 
underworld ;  rather, it rose above them and so surmounted them. 
Occasional ly it captured them : Eleusis . For the citizen and city-dweller, 
representational space and the representation of space, though they did 
not coincide, were harmonious and congruent. 1 0 A unity was achieved 
here between the order of the world, the order of the city and the order 
of the house - between the three levels of segments consti tuted by 
physical space, polit ical space (the city along with its domains) ,  and 
urban space ( i . e .  within the city proper) . This unity was not a simple 
or a homogeneous one, but rather a unity of composition and of 
proportion, a unity embracing and presupposing differences and hier­
archy. By the same token knowledge and power, social theory and social 
practice, were commensurate with each other. And time, the rhythm of 
days and feasts, accorded with the organization of space - with house­
hold altars ,  with centres of collective activity, with the boule in  the 
agora (a free and open citizens' assembly) ,  with temples and with stadia. 

Al l historical societies have diminished the importance of women and

philology, lacks the poetic breadth of the Nietzschean view.

restricted the influence of the female principle. The Greeks reduced the 
woman's station to that of the ferti l ity of a field owned and worked by 
her husband. The female rea lm was in the household: around the shrine 
or hearth ; a round the omphalos, a circu lar, closed and fixed space ; or 
around the oven - last rel ic of the shadowy abyss. Women's social status 
was restricted just as their symbolic and practical status was - indeed, 
these two aspects were inseparable so far as spatia l i ty (spatial practice) 
was concerned. 

The underworld had thus not disappeared. In daytime, Zeus and 
reason had vanquished the shadowy or  chthonian forces . But in the 
depths of the infernal world, their defeat notwithstanding, the Titans 
were sti l l  active. In the country of the dead the shades had drunk the 
waters of  Lethe. Greek genius was able to localize the underworld, to 
speci fy and name it, and in  so doing to subordinate it to the surface 
world - to the mountains with thei r grazing flocks, to the cultivated 
fields, to the sea ploughed by ships laden with riches. Instead of dominat­
ing and appropriating the netherworld a fter the fashion of the Romans, 
the Greeks set that world apart and situated i t  (as a t  Delphi, or in the 
revels of the Bacchantes) .  The meaning of  such images is nor to be found 
in l i terary works. On the contrary, r i tes and mythic narratives ( from 
Hesiod to Plato) tell in images and symbols what is occurring in social 
space. Conceptual rational izations were indeed offered by the Greeks 
themselves - but only much later (a long with phi losophy) ,  towards the 
end of their civi l ization . 

v 

If most societies have fol lowed th is same route, how are we to account 
for their di fferences ? How is i t  that d ifferent societies assign different 
roles to the male principle and its dominant form, and that this dominant 
form itself is d i fferently formulated from one society to another? Greece, 
for example, which took Athens as its model, and Italy, which took 
Rome, differ so radica l ly that the one produced and transmitted the 
Logos ( logic and knowledge) while the other produced and transmitted 
the Law. 

Psychoana lysis might on the face of it be expected to find problems 
such as these easy to tackle, but in practice the triangular Oedipal 
model can support only a very mechanistic and homogenizing causal 
explanation .  The 'Oedipal triangle' i s  supposedly to be found every­
where, and is said to be a structure having explanatory force, but if 



FR OM ABSOLUTE S PACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 249 

i t  is an unchanging structure how does it give rise to such diverse 
outcomes ? 

In any event, our present approach to the question is a quite different 
one, for our aim is to treat social practice as an extension of the body, 
an extension which comes about as part of space's development in time, 
and thus too as part of a h i storicity i tself conceived of as produced. 

There is surely an argument for drawing a distinction within this 
history between manl iness and mascul inity. In Rome the mascul ine 
virtues and values, those of the mi l itary man and the administrator, 
were i n  command. Manl iness, by contrast, was a Greek attribute - the 
kind of manl iness that dictates constant defiance towards one's enemies 
and constant rival ry with one's friends, that cultivates performance, 
whether in brutal or subtle form, as i ts basic raison d'etre and goal ,  and 
that aspires above all to excel; this is an aspiration, however, which 
despises everyday tasks yet, capriciously, confuses matters when long­
term decisions are called for .  Manl iness so understood, and elevated to 
the cosmic level, to the level of the gods, conserves the traits of small 
groups in competit ion. 

In their cult of manl iness and rivalry, the Greeks distinguished between 
good and bad approaches to the eristic or agonistic. The bad sought 
the destruction of the adversary, whi le the good meant respecting the 
adversary even while seeking to outdo h im.  1 1  Dike, or just ice, discrimi­
nated between these two aspects of chal lenge and defiance, a distinction 
which is not impl ied in the idea of hubris. Whereas, in the Roman case, 
there are grounds for contrasting an in itial intuitus with a final habitus, 
no such division is ca l led for apropos of the Greeks.

point of  the acropolis, the temple presided over and rounded out the 
city's spatio-temporal space. Bui l t  in no image, the temple was simply 
there, 'standing in the rocky val ley' .  I t  arranged and drew about itself 
(and about the god to which it was devoted) the grid of relations within 
which births and deaths, adversity and good fortune, victories and 
defeats came about (Heidegger) .  There was nothing decorative here, and 
noth ing functiona l .  The space, the cut of  the stones, the geometry of 
the masses, the overal l  scheme - none of these could be separated 
from the others. The beams and l intels with their supports and props 
determined the disposition of space and the distribution of volumes. 
Hence the stress on the 'orders' and their significance. These 'orders', 
as defined by Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns, refer both to con­
struction and to decoration. The Cosmos, l ike a fine head of  hair above 
a noble brow, deployed its glory without separating the good from the 
beautiful .  

What, then, of  difference ? Difference was produced. Not produced as 
such,  however - not conceptually, nor by virtue of an idea .  Difference 
was never part - except perhaps much later, and then indirectly - of a 
body of knowledge, of a sequence of propositions, or of an epistemologi­
cal field, whether or not associated with a core of knowledge. A differ­
ence conceptual ized is surely a lready reduced, solely by virtue of the 
fact that the two elements in question are now governed by the same 
comparison, are part of the same thought, part of the same intel lectual 
act. Even i f  this act is fol lowed by an action, a practical action which 
real i zes it, the di fference is  still merely induced. 

Between the Cosmos and the 'world', di fference a rose as part of a 
'h istorica l '  p rocess, each side of the dichotomy being ignorant of, or 
misapprehending, the other. It might .be claimed, with the benefit of 
hindsight, that a particu lar  image or concept of space must have been 
informed by the low or by the h igh - by the abyss below or the summits 
above - and that i t  emphasized such and such a direction, such and 
such an  orientation. Fa i r  enough . But neither of the opposing images 
was constituted specifically against the other, in contradistinction to it. 
Rather, the difference occurred spontaneously, which is what distin­
guishes produced difference from di fference which is induced, and gener­
al ly reduced. 



FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT S PACE 25 1 

VI 

What is the mode of existence of absolute space ? Is it imagined or is 
i t  rea l ? 

To phrase the question in this manner makes any coherent answer 
impossible .  Faced with such an a l ternative, one can only oscil late indefi­
nitely between the choices offered. Imaginary ? Of course ! How could 
an 'absolute' space have a concrete existence ? Yet i t  must also be deemed 
rea l ,  for how could the religious space of Greece or Rome not possess 
pol it ical ' real i ty ' ?  

There is  thus a sense in  wh ich the existence of absolute space i s  purely 
menta l ,  and hence ' imaginary'. In another sense, however, i t  a lso has a 
socia l  existence, and hence a specific and powerful ' reality' .  The 'mental' 
is ' real ized' in a chain of 'socia l '  activities because, in the temple, i n  the 
city, i n  monuments and palaces, the imaginary is transformed into the 
rea l .  What the above formulation of the question ignores or fa i ls to 
grasp is the existence of these works, an existence which certainly 
transgresses and in a l l  l ikel ihood transcends such triv ial ized and latter­
day categories as 'the imaginary '  and 'the rea l ' .  When asked whether a 
temple and its surroundings are imaginary or real, the realist wil l  nat­
urally see only stones, whereas the metaphysician  wil l  see a place conse­
crated in the name of a divinity. But of course there must be more to 
it than this .  

Absolute space has not disappeared. Nor does i t  survive only in 
churches and cemeteries. The Ego takes refuge in a pit - in its 'world' 
- whenever i t  fa l l s  from its perch on some crag of the Logos . Its voice 
may emerge from an often mephitic and sometimes inspired cavern. Is 
this perhaps the space of speech ? Both imaginary and real ,  i t  i s  forever 
insinuating itsel f 'in between' - and specifically into the unassignable 
interstice between bodi ly space and bodies-in-space (the forbidden) .  
Wh o  speaks ? And where from ? A s  i t  becomes more and more famil iar,  
this question serves increasingly to conceal the paradox of absolute 
space - a mental space into which the letha l  abstraction of signs inserts 
itself, there to pursue self-transcendence (by means of gesture, voice, 
dance, music, etc . ) .  Words are in  space, yet not in space. They speak of 
space, and enclose it .  A discourse on space implies a truth of space, and 
this must derive not from a location within space, but rather from a 
place imaginary and real - and hence 'surreal ' ,  yet concrete . And, yes 
- conceptual also. 

Might not this space, extracted from nature yet endowed with proper-

ties just as natu ral  as chose of sculptures hewn from wood and stone, 
be also the space of art ?  

VII 

As part of the protracted decl ine of the Roman scare-city-Empire (as 
defined by i ts political power, and by chat power's basis in the earth, 
in  landownersh ip) ,  the ci ty gradual ly ceased to be. The vil la of a lat ifun­
diary landowner retained not a trace of the sacred . It  was the concretiz­
at ion, within agro-pastoral space, of a codified, law-bound spacial prac­
tice, namely private ownersh ip of the land.  The vi l la  thus combined in 
a single unit of  material production the general tra its of Roman society 
(an order grounded in j u ridical princip les ) ,  a refined - albeit not very 
creative - aesthetic caste, and a search for the comforts of l i fe .  Testimony 
co chis is to be found as early as the classical period, in the writings of 
Cicero, Pliny and ochers. The resulting d iversification of space, along 
with the legal predominance of the private realm, meant che loss of 
Greek order and a rupture of the unity of form, structure and function ;  
i t  also meant a split , within bui ldings themselves, between decorative 
and functional elements, between the treatment of masses and che treat­
ment of  surfaces, and hence between construction and composition, 
archi tecture and urban real ity. Consequently the Roman vil la (of the 
Lower Empire and the decadent era) emerges as the generator of a new 
space, a space with a great future in Western Europe. Herein l ies the 
secret of the Roman world's survival despi te its decl i ne. I t is not just 
that the v i l la  gave rise to many of our towns and vi l l ages; i t  also 
introduced a conception of space the characteristics of which would 
continue co manifest themselves in l ater times : the dissociation of  com­
ponent elements, and a consequent practical diversification ; subordi­
nation to the un i fying but abstract principle of property ; and the incor­
poration into space of this same principle, which is in itself impossible 
to l ive, even for the landowner, because i t  is j u ridical in  nature, and 
hence external ,  and supposedly superior, to ' l ived experience' .  

This, then,  was the road taken by che Roman spir i t  on the way to its 
demise. (A long road, in point of fact, because in the twentieth century 
the end has sti l l nor been reached . )  Once unshackled, the principle of 
private property did not remain steri le :  rather, ic gave birth co a space. 
The centuries-long s ilence of the state is portrayed in official history, 
and indeed in the work of most h istori ans, as a void,  a complete h iatus 
in historical existence. Nothing could be fu rther from che truth . The 



FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO ABSTRA CT SPACE 253 

Gallo-Roman West preserved the most valuable Roman achievements : 
the art of bui lding, the art of irrigation systems and dykes, the great 
roads, agricultural advances (to which the Gauls had made their own 
contribution),  and, last and most important, the right of (private) prop­
erty. This ' right' should not, any more than money or the commodity, 
be looked upon as the root of a l l  evil . It is not intrinsica l ly  bad. The 
property pr inciple, by dominating space - and this in  the l i teral sense 
of subjecting i t  to its dominion - put an end to the mere contemplation 
of nature, of the Cosmos or of the world, and pointed the way towards 
the mastery which transforms instead of simply interpreting. I t  may be 
asked, however, whether in the society which it dominated this principle 
did not reach an impasse. Inasmuch as  i t  was taken in isolation and 
erected into an absolu te, i t  certainly did.  Which is why the barbarians' 
arrival on the scene had a salutary effect, for in violating the sanctity 
of property these intruders ferti l ized it .  For this to happen, of course, i t  
was also necessary that they be accepted and given a chance to establish 
themselves, to turn the vi l lae to good account, and to get the Gallo­
Roman settlers to work by subordinating them to leaders of vi l lage 
communities who had now become lords. So far as space was concerned, 
the barbarians m ight be said to have rejuvenated it  by rediscovering the 
old markers of agro-pastoral (and in  fact primari ly pastora l )  t imes. 

It may thus be seen that during the supposed emptiness of  the late 
imperial or early medieval period a new space was establ ished which 
supplanted the absolute space, and secularized the religious and political 
space, of Rome. These changes were necessary though not sufficient 
conditions for the subsequent development of a h istorical space, a space 
of accumulat ion. The 'vi l la ' ,  now either a lordly domain or a vi l lage, 
had durably defined a place as an establ i shment bound to the soi l .  

VIII 

Rendered more sophisticated by (Augustinian) theology, the imago 
mundi we have been discussing survived the decl ine of the Roman 
Empire and state, the rise of the lat ifundia, and their dramatic clash 
with the barbarian innovators . Viewed in this l ight, the year 1 000 
appears as a truly pregnant moment. With in an apparent void, a new 
departure was being prepared. Contemporaries were overwhelmed by 
anxiety because they could perceive only the past. But space had a l ready 
been transformed, and was already the birthplace and cradle of what 
was to come.

Christianity, whatever institutional ups and downs it was experienc­
ing, was a great worshipper of tombs. Its hol iest places, those stamped 
by divinity - Rome, Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela - were all 
tombs : St Peter's, Christ's, St james's. The great pi lgrimages drew the 
crowds to shrines, to relics, to objects sanctified by death . The 'world' 
held sway. Th is was a religion which 'coded' death, r itualizing, 
ceremonial izing and solemnizing it . The monks in their cloisters contem­
plated death, and could contemplate only death : they had to die in the 
'world' so that the 'world' might be fu lfil led. Essential ly cryptic in nature, 
religion revolved around those underground places, church crypts. Lying 
beneath each church or monastery, the crypt always held the bones or 
a portion of the remains of a consecrated figure - sometimes myth ical, 
sometimes historical .  Historical figures were genera l ly martyrs, who had 
borne witness with thei r l ives, and continued to bear witness from their 
catacombs - from 'depths' which no longer had anything in c0mmon 
with the ancient world's realm of shadows. The saint's presence in the 
crypt was supposed to concentrate there the l i fe and death forces diffused 
throughout the 'world ' ;  absolute space was identified with subterranean 
space. Such was the dismal religion which waxed as Rome, i ts city and 
state, waned. It paral leled an agricultural society of mediocre pro­
ductivity where agriculture itsel f (except around the monasteries) was 
degenerating, where famine th reatened, and where whatever fert i l ity did 
exist was attri buted to occult forces. I t  was to this context that the 
syncretic unity of an Earth-Mother, a cruel God-the-Father and a bene­
volent mediator was applied. Crypts and tombs always held traces and 
representations of saints, but, it would seem, hardly ever sculptures. 
Paintings, yes - paintings remarkable in  that they were never seen, 
except perhaps, on the saint's feast day, by clergy entering the crypt 
with l ighted candles. At such moments of intensity the images came to 
l i fe, the dead made their appearance. Cryptal art of this kind has noth ing 
visual about it, and for those who th ink in the categories of a later time, 
projecting them into the past, i t  poses an i nsoluble problem . How can a 
painting remain out of sight, condemned to a purely noccurnal existence?  
What is the raison d'etre of Lascaux 's frescoes, or of those in the crypt 
of St-Savin ? The answer is that these paintings were made not to be 
seen, but  merely to 'be' - and so that they might be known to ' be' there. 
They are magical images, condensing subterranean qual i ties, signs of 
death and traces of  the struggle against death, whose aim is to turn 
death 's forces against death i tsel f. 

Consider the Church. What a narrow, indeed mistaken, view 1t 1s 
which piccures the Church as an entity hav ing its main 'seat' in Rome 



F R O M  ABSOLUTE SPACE TO A BSTRACT SPACE 255 

and maintaining its presence by means of clerics in individual 'churches' 
or v i l lages and towns, i n  convents, monasteries, basi l icas, and so forth . 
The fact is that the 'world' - that imaginary-real  space of shadows -
was inhabited, haunted by the Church . This underworld broke through 
here and there - wherever the Ch urch had a 'seat', from that of the 
lowl iest country priest to that of the Pope himself; and wherever it thus 
pierced the earth's surface, the 'world'  emerged . The 'world'  - that of 
rel igious agitation, of the Church suffering and mi l itant - lay and moved 
below the surface. This space, the space of Ch ristendom, was a space 
that could in the twelfth century be occupied by the powerful personal i ty 
of a Bernard of Clairvaux. Indeed, without its magico-mystica l, 
imaginary-real un ity, i t  would be impossi ble to account for the influence 
of this genius, who controlled two kings and told the sovereign ponti ff, 
'I am more Pope than you . '  Just as something new was appearing on 
the horizon, Berna rd of Clairvaux revalorized the space of the signs of 
death , of desperate contemplation, of asceticism. The masses ral l ied 
about h im - and not only the masses. His poor-man's bed epitomized 
his space. 

What exactly happened in the twelfth century ? According to the 
received wisdom of the h istorians, h istory suddenly resumed a fter a long 
interruption . Only now were certain ' factors' created wh ich would 
mould the modern epoch - and the job of tracking these down makes 
for a good deal of suspense. The restraint displayed for so long by 
History is only rival led by that of the historians, fla i l ing about in 
this crepuscu lar  dawn, unravel l ing some facts but few causes. They 
demonstrate admirable prudence too, in hesitating to speak of revolution 
apropos of the great movements of the twelfth century 1 2  - the more so 
since to do so might obl ige them to consider the peasant revolution (or 
'revolt  of  the serfs ' ) ,  which cha l lenged the state of serv i l i ty, in  i ts 
connections with the urban revolution, which overth rew the existing 
social arrangements as a whole. Who would profit from these transform­
ations ? The monarch, certainly, and his authority, and the state, which 
to begin with had a feudal and mi l itary character. But of course those 
changes which first hove into view in the twelfth century did not occur 
immediately. What was the precise mix of happenstance and determin­
ism that made possible the careers of such exceptional men as Bernard 
of Clairvaux, Suger and Abelard ? There is no way for us to grasp 
retrospectively what came about at that time if we cannot form a clear

perception of the locus and cradle of these events. That the towns came 
once more to the fore is beyond dispute . To the question 'What did the 
towns contribute that was new - what did they produce ? '  we arc incl ined 
to answer, 'A new space. '  Does this obviate the methodological and 
theoretical difficulties that arise when we consider time - historica l ,  or 
supposedly h istorica l ,  time - in isolation ? Perhaps. The rise of the 
medieval town has to be viewed along with its impl ications and conse­
quences. I t  presupposed a surplus production in the countryside suf­
ficient to feed the urban population, both because the town was 
organized as a market and because urban craftsmen worked with 
materials (wool, leather) produced by agricultural labour. This was what 
led to the setting-up of corporate bodies of communitarian inspiration 
within the u rban col lectivity . A lthough the members of such corpor­
ations had nothing 'proletarian'  about them, i t  is true to say that the 
advent of these associations heralded the arrival of a col lective worker, 
a worker able to produce 'social ly '  - that is to say, for society, and in 
this instance for the town. 

The Papacy sought to defend i tsel f against these developments, coun­
ter-attacking and scoring some measure of success. I ts grand design, 
however - namely, the replacement of the imperial state, whose mantle 
the Roman Church wished to assume, by a vast ecclesiastical state -
was doomed to fa i lure. The nations, the nation states, were now about 
to appear. Monastic culture was on the ebb. What was about to disap­
pear was absolute space; it was a l ready crumbling as its supports gave 
way. What then was about to emerge ? The space of a secular  l i fe, freed 
from poli tico-religious space, from the space of signs of death and of 
non-body. 

The urban l andscape of the Middle Ages turned the space which 
preceded it, the space of the 'world', upon its head. It was a landscape 
fil led with broken l ines and vertica ls, a landscape that leapt forth from 
the earth bristl ing with sculptures. In contrast to the maleficent utopia 
of the subterranean 'world', it proclaimed a benevolent and luminous 
utopia where knowledge would be independent, and instead of serving 
an oppressive power would contribute to the strengthening of an auth­
ority grounded in reason. What do the great cathedrals say ? They assert 
an inversion of space as compared with previous rel igious structures. 
They concentrate the diffuse meaning of space onto the medieval town.  
They 'decrypt' i n  a vigorous (perhaps more than a rigorous) sense of 
the word : they are an emancipation from the crypt and from cryptic 
space. The new space did not merely 'decipher' the old, for, in 
deciphering i t, it surmounted it ;  by freeing itse l f  it ach ieved i l l umination

and e levat ion.  The field now rema ined decidedly, and decisively, in  
possess ion of what has been cal led 'white communication' .  D The other 
sort, the black, was not, however, annihi l ated. Merely, i t  took refuge 
in the subterranean parts of society, in places hidden away from face­
to- face communicat ion. 

An extraordinary tr io mobil ized and resisted this great movement of 
emergence : Bernard of Cla irvaux, Suger and Abelard .  These three cannot 
be understood separately. Bernard, the perfect ' reactor' , had the ear of 
the powerful  yet knew how to hold the attention of the masses. Suger, 
who served the state - a state which was royal ,  mi l i tary, and already 
'nationa l '  because territorial - conceived and carried out political pro­
jects . And Abelard - the heretic - was at the cutting edge of the possible, 
part of the sort of thinking which by questioning basic assumptions 
shook the edifice to its foundations. He was also the most effective of 
the th ree, h i s  apparent fai lure notwithstanding. Despite a persecution 
which spared him no humi l iation, wh ich seized upon a romantic intrigue 
as a stick with which to beat him, Abelard would later be recognized 
as the 'most modern' figure of his time. 

The crypt at  St-Savin holds the now symbol ic  'earthly dust' and images 
of St Gervase and St Protase, and of their edifying l ives and martyrdom. 
The church vault ,  however, features scenes from the Scriptures, from 
the Old and New Testaments - painted imagery diametrical ly opposed 
to cryptidcryptal space. The vault  'decrypts' by exposing the contents 
of the underground chambers to the l ight of day. St-Savin's counterposed 
images thus perfectly crystal l ize the moment of emergence that I have 
been describing. 

In his book Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism, Erwin Panofsky 
is not content, when attempting to d iscover the links between the various 
aspects of the twelfth century, with an appeal to a Hegel ian Zeitgeist -
to the notion of a pervasive and thus banal spirit of the t imes. The 
idea of an analogy between arch i tecture and phi losophy has noth ing 
paradoxical or new about i t  per se, 14 but Panofsky goes beyond the 
identification o f  a fruitful encounter between technique and symbol 15 -
beyond an approach that itself transcended Viollet-le-Duc's rational istic 
interpretation (which, despite his sophist icated analysis of social and 
historical processes, rema ined mechanistic, technicistic and functional ist

in  character 1 6 ) .  Cathedrals can be accounted for neither by intersecting 
rib vaults, nor by buttresses and flying buttresses - even i f  such features 
are necessary conditions thereof. The same goes for the soul's yearning 
heavenwards, the youthful ardour of a new generation, and other such 
considerations .  Panofsky posits a homology (not j ust an analogy) 
between phi losophy and architecture, arguing that each , though com­
plete in its own way, partakes with the other of a unity of which i t  is 
a 'manifestation' - an elucidation, in the sense in which faith may be 
said to be elucidated by reason. To the question which of the two has 
priority, Panofsky's answer is phi losophy.  For priority there has to be. 
Scholasticism produced a menta l habit or habitus, and hence a modus 
operandi derived from a modus essendi, from a raison d 'etre. The 
habitus of a rch i tecture was directly descended from the p rovidentia l  
reason which at the  t ime presided over the unity of truth - over that 
un ity of reason and fa ith whose culminating expression was the Summa 
theologica. 1 7  The spatial arrangement of the Gothic church corresponds 
for Panofsky to that great work - or rather i t  ' reproduces' it, embodying 
as it does a reconci l ing of opposites, a tripartite total ity ,  and the organi­
zational equi l ibrium of a system whose component parts are themselves 
homologues . 1 8  Thus Panofsky sees nothing problematic about deriving 
a mental space, that of  a speculative construction, the Summa theologica, 
from an abstract representation, that of  a unity of homologous parts 
itse lf  analogous to the unity of the Divin ity (one-in-th ree and th ree-in­
one ) ;  nor in  further deriving from that mental space a socia l  one - the 
space of the cathedral .  What is rea l ly being engendered and produced 
(or reproduced) here, however, is the divine act of creation i tsel f. One 
would indeed have to be a person of great rel igious faith to see nothing 
objectionable in such an a rgument, which is in reality a fine example 
of the abuse of a concept - the concept of production in  the event - by 
bl indly divorcing it from al l  content and all context. The identification 
of thought with the productive activi ty of God is justified by the adduc­
tion of wou ld-be scientific concepts such as structural affinity - or the 
supposed 'search for the geometrical location of the symbolic expression 
specific to a society and an epoch ' . 1 9  It  is as though simply replacing

the word 'create' by the word 'produce' sufficed to val idate this extra­
ordinary leap - and with it an  idealism and spiritual ism of the most 
i rresponsible and facile variety. The thesis i s  hardly persuasive. 

Panofsky was in  search of a principle of unity. Why did he opt for a 
habitus rather than an intuitus ? And was he even speaking of a habitus 
as defined by Aquinas, for humanity, as a 'mode of being' implying a 
'power of  use and enjoyment',2° and hence as a qual ity which is a basic 
attribute of a person (consider the connection with habere and habitare) ? 
This is what distinguishes 'habitus' from 'habit ' .  How could a doctrine 
conta i n  a habitus (or mental habit )  and a modus operandi capable -
barring miracles - of giving rise to several such di fferent frameworks as 
those of writing, art, music, and so on ? Sti l l ,  this spiritual istic nonsense 
does conceal the concrete intui tion of a certain unity, a certain  pro­
duction. What Panofsky discovered - or, at least, what emerged from 
his work - is the idea of a 'visual logic ' . 2 1 What does he mean by thi s ?  
That t he  religious edifice, by rising h igher, receives more l igh t ;  that its 
naves no longer have the compact and sombre atmosphere of so-cal led 
Romanesque churches; that its wal ls become less massive now that they 
no longer bear all the weight, and that the pi l lars, small columns and 
ribbing rise with slender elegance towards the vault ;  that stained-glass 
windows make their appearance and the making of them becomes an 
art. More than this, too: that the Scholastic mind accepts and even 
demands a double clarification - the 'clari fication of function through 
form' and the 'cla rification of thought through language' . 22 

Panofsky does not take h is  thinking as far as it wil l  go, however. The 
ful l  implication of his 'visual logic' is that all should be revealed. Al l ? 
Yes - everyth ing which was formerly hidden, the secrets of the world. 
Even demonic and evil forces .  Even natural beings - plants and animals .  
Even l iving bodies. As they burst up into the l ight, bodies rook their 
revenge; the signs of non-body23 became subordinate to those of the 
body - including the resurrected body of  the living God, of Christ. This 
was the new al l iance of  the 'world' , opening up now to the light, with 

20 See Gaboriau, Nouvelle initiation, vol . I I ,  pp. 62, 97. There is noth ing intrinsically 
wrong with the i nrroduction of these phi losophical (scholastic) concepts, but their specu la­
tive use, without any point of reference besides the Thomist system itsel f, opens the way 
to some very questionable manoeuvres.

the Logos and the Cosmos. And it was a trend that encouraged the 
rediscovery of Greek thought, of Plato and Ari stotle. The resu rrection 
of the flesh, h itherto a peripheral matter, now became centra l ;  th is is 
the meaning of the Last Judgements (though such works continued to 
induce terror by invoking death and the underworld) .  Once the under­
world had come to the surface, while the surface world rose upwards 
and offered itse lf  to view as occupier of space, scu lpture had l i ttle 
d ifficul ty routing cryptidcryptal painting. Whence the profusion of capi­
tals, and of statues on fai;ades. Freed from the ir  former weightiness, 
surfaces now carried decoration glorifying the body (even if the idea of 
sin sti l l  managed here and there to bring minds back to putrefaction, 
to the immundus, to the 'world ' ) .  Scu lpture was once more, as in ancient 
Greece, the primordia l ,  the lead ing art. Pa inting retained a measure of 
dignity only as an art of l ighting ( i .e .  as stained glass ) .  

To l imit  th i s  new creative force to an 'architectural composition' that 
made it possible to ' re-experience the very processes of cogitation'  ( in  
the  Summa theologica) is to  frame a hypothesis so  reductionist as to  be  
start l ing in the  extreme.24 It has a double advantage, however, for i t  
gets us up to the  aggiornamento of Scholasticism whi le  denigrating a l l  
the  reforming, subversive and exemplary aspects of the  medieva l  revol­
ution in the West. Does i t  make sense, then, to speak of a 'v isual logic' ?  
Certain ly :  an emergence from darkness and  a coming ou t  into the light. 
The point is, though, that  this goes far beyond Gothic archi tecture and 
involves the towns, pol i tical action, poetry and music, and thought in 
general .  The role of Abelard, his thought and l i fe, can only be understood 
in terms of a revolt of the body which certain ly went beyond any 'visual 
logic' - which went as far, in fact, as to anticipate a reconci l iation 
between flesh and spir it  effected thanks to the intervention of the Third 
Person, the Holy Spirit . 

What i s  involved, therefore, is a production - the production of a 
space. Not merely a space of ideas, an ideal space, but a social and a 
mental space. An emergence. A decrypting of the space that went before. 
Thought and philosophy came to the surface, rose from the depths, but 
l ife was decrypted as a result ,  and society as a whole, along with space. 
If one were of a mind to dist inguish, a fter the fashion of texcual 
analysis,25 between a genotype and a phenotype of space, i t  would be 
from this 'emergence' that the 'genospatia l '  would have to be derived. 

Of an origina l i ty and revolutionary force such that it spread through-

out  the  West from i t s  starting-point in the I le-de-France with extraordi­
nary ( relative) speed, the 'production' with wh ich we are concerned may 
correctly be described as tending towards the 'v isual '  The importance 
taken on by fa<;ades confirms this - indeed it is in itself sufficient proof 
of the fact. Organized with the greatest care, these h igh and highly 
worked surfaces were strictly governed by the Church 's commands:  
Law, Fa ith, Scripture. The l iv ing, naked body had a very l imited role :  
Eve, Adam, and occasional others. One finds few female bodies aside 
from those of ascet ics and those of the damned. The fa<;ade rose in 
affi rmation of prestige ; its purpose was to trumpet the associated 
authorities of  Church, King and city to the crowds flocking towards the 
porch . Despite the efforts of medieval archi tects to have the exterior 
present the interior and render i t  visible, the mere ex istence of the fa<;ade 
sufficed to destroy any such concordance. 

The production of a l uminous space and the emergence of that space 
did not as yet, i n  the thirteenth century, entail either its subordination 
to the wri tten word or its mounting as 'spectacle' .26 Sti l l ,  to the extent 
that he i s  accurate, Panofsky is describing a th reatening gambit . The 
trend towards visual ization, underpinned by a strategy, now came in to 
its own - and this in col lusion on the one hand with abstraction, with 
geometry and logic, and on the other with authority. Socia l  space, even 
as early as th is, was a l ready being affected by this a lchemical formula 
with its disturbing ingredients and surprising effects. Admittedly, the 
( loose) th reshold beyond which real ization becomes reification, and 
vita l i ty becomes al ienated vital ity, was not as yet crossed . But portents 
of that step were certa inly present .  The negative and letha l  magic of 
signs - that magic which by means of a painting can immobil ize a bird 
in fu l l  flight, in perfect mimicry of the hunter's mortal strike - carried 
the day. The other kind of magic, by contrast, the magic of the spoken 
word, whose symbolisms (the breath of the Spirit, the bird of  prophecy, 
the act of creation ) infused even the rea lm of death with l i fe, could only 
retreat before the intense onslaught of visual ization. As for sculpture, it 
is more eloquent than painting in the three dimensions of space; but 
what it says it says al l at once, and once and for al l .  There is no appea l .  

The vertica l ity and  political arrogance of towers, their feudal ism, 
already int imated the coming al l iance between Ego and Phal lus .  Uncon-

sciously, of course - and all the more effectively for that. 
The Phallus is seen . The female genital organ, representing the world, 

remains h idden. The prestigious Phal lus, symbol of power and fecundity, 
forces its way into view by becoming erect. In the space to come, where 
the eye would usurp so many privi leges, it would fal l  to the Phal lus to 
receive or produce them . The eye in question would be that of God, 
that of the Father or that of the Leader. A space in which th is eye la id 
hold of whatever served its purposes would a lso be a space of force, of 
violence, of power restra ined by nothing but the l imitations of i ts  means. 
This was to be the space of the triune God, the space of kings, no longer 
the space of  cryptic signs but rather the space of the written word and 
the rule of h istory. The space, too, of mi l itary violence - and hence a 
masculine space.27

Consider the demise of a society able to spend its surplus in sumptuous 
fashion on festivals, monuments and wars waged for mere show or mere 
prestige: how and when did the non-accumulative and the non-historical 
make their joint disappearance ? 

The development of a theory of accumulation, init iated by Marx, 
remains unfinished. What made primitive accumulation possib le?  And 
what were its impl ications, aside from the feasibi l ity of investing wealth 
rather than saving or squandering it, and aside from the rational i ty 
attending that change (cf. Max Weber ) ? 

The accumulation of money for investment, and productive investment 
itself, a re hard to conceive of without a paral le l  accumulation of  tech­
niques and knowledge. Indeed these are all rea l ly  aspects of an indivisible 
accumulation process. So, if the Middle Ages saw a growth in  the 
p roductive forces and in production (first of a l l  in agricul ture, the 
p recondition of the rise of towns), this is attributable to the di ffusion 
of techn iques and to the fact that they were adopted in one p lace or 
another. The documentary evidence confirms th is. 

27 It is hard to imagine a less convincing or murkier thesis than the claim of some 
psychoanalysts that speech is l inked to the penis; see for example C. Stein ,  L 'enfant 
imaginaire ( Paris :  Denoel, 1 97 1 ) ,  p. 1 8 1 .  As for a phal lus that al legedly  castrates the 
c l i toris and diminishes the vagina,  i t  hardly seems unjust that i t  should subsequently be 
emasculated by the 'eye of God', see S. Viderman, La constmction de /'espace analytique 
(Paris :  Denoel, I 970), pp. 1 26ff. I cannot help feel ing that something essentia l  is being 
overlooked amidst all this exchanging of low blows.

The problem that has not yet been satisfactori ly  resolved is th is :  

In many societies, notab ly in Western antiquity, a number of the 
preconditions for the accumulation process were present, including 
a commodity and money-based economy, scientific though t and 
knowledge , and the existence of towns. How is it then tha t this 
process was not set in  motion at that t ime and place, and that, in 
so far as we can assign it a h istorical origin, i t  dates only from 
medieval Europe?  What conditions were not met earl ier ? What 
obstacles stood in  the way ? 

Many answers to these quest ions have been proposed - slavery, constant 
wars, extravagance, the parasitism of the ruling classes (or even of the 
Roman plebes) - but none is theoretica l ly satisfying ; any or al l  of these 
h istorical ' factors' may have had a part in the interdiction or el imination 
of a trend towards accumulation, yet none can ful ly account for it .  One 
is a lmost ready to hear that spiritual or  political authorities, i n  their 
profound wisdom, rook measures to prevent such a development - a 
hypothesis that would amount to endowing castes, priests ,  warlords or 
polit ical leaders not so much with a profound as with a superhuman 
wisdom .

With the dimming of the 'world' of shadows, the terror it exercised 
lessened accordingly. I r  did not, however, disappear. Rather, it was 
transformed into ' heterotopica l '  places, places of sorcery and madness, 
places inhabited by demonic forces - p laces which were fascinating but 
tabooed. Later, much later, artists would rediscover this ferment of 
sacred and accursed. At the time when i t  held sway, however, no one 
could represent this 'world ' ;  it was simply there. Space was ridden with 
hidden powers, more often f!lal ign than wel l -dispo"Sea. Each such place

pastoral period had not been effaced during the Roman era. On the 
contrary, the Romans' innumerable minor superstitions rel ating to the 
earth, carried down via the villae and t ied into the great maledictions 
of Christianity, could only susta in the profusi.on of sacred/cursed sites 
scattered across the face of the land. In the twel fth century a metamor­
phosis occurred, a displacement, a subversion of signifiers. More pre­
cisely, what had formerly signi fied, i n  an immediate manner, that which 
was forbidden, now came to refer solely to itsel f qua signifier - stripped 
of any emotional or magical referentia l  charge. Few places, it would 
seem, were deprived of their names, but, typical ly,  new names were 
superimposed upon the old, thus creating a web of place-names innocent 
of any rel igious overtones. Common examples of such names are 
Chateau-ncuf, Vil le-Franche, Les Essarts, and Bois-le-Roi. May such 
reference to groups of words and signs which as signifiers have been 
stripped of meaning be legi timately considered part of a great subversive 
current ? Certainly .  To deny this, in fact, one would have to be the sort 
of  fetishizer of signs who takes them for the immutable foundation of 
knowledge and the unvarying basis of society . Besides being decrypted, 
medieval space was also cleared. Social practice - which did not know 
where i t  was going - made space avai lable for someth ing else, made it 
vacant ( though not empty ) .  As part of the same process, the ' l ibido' was 
freed - that tripartite l ib ido which was denounced by Augustinian 
theology and which founded the secular  world :  libido sciendi, domin­
andi, sentiendi: curiosity, ambition, sensual ity. Thus l iberated, l ibido 
mounted an assaul t  upon the space open before it . This space, decon­
secrated, at  once spiritual and materi al ,  intel lectual and sensory, and 
populated by signs of the body, would become the recipient, first of an 
accumulation of knowledge, then of an accumulation of riches.  Its 
source, to locate it precisely, was less the medieval town envisaged as a 
community of burghers than that town's marketplace and market hall 
(a long with their inevitable companions the campani le and the town 
ha l l ) .  

In th i s  connection - apropos of the  marketplace and the  market hal l 
- it bears repeating that the degradation of money and the baleful 
character of the commodity manifested themselves only l ater. At the 
time which concerns us, the exchangeable 'thing', the object produced 
to be sold, was sti l l  a rarity - and had a l iberating function. ft was an 
iconoclastic force and a scandal to the spirit of religious devotion 
p romoted by the l ikes of Bernard of Clairvaux - who was the founder 
of a kind of Cistercian state, and an apologist, on the one hand for

poverty, asceticism and contempt for the world, and on the other hand 
for the absolute hegemony of the Church . 

Money and commodities, sti l l  in statu nascendi, were destined to 
bring with them- not6flly a 'culture' but also a space. The uniqueness

as external  to the city, as outside its polit ical system, and so relegated

ownership of the land. The medieval revolution brought commerce 
inside the town and lodged it at the centre of a transformed urban 
space. Th�etplace diff:�e.d _ _ fr9_ip. _thco:. fornm .. as_ from .. the_ ;igora:

inspired invention, was for its part as fa r removed from the portico as 
it was from the basi l ica; i ts  function was to shelter the transaction of 
business whi le permitting the authorities to control it . The cathedral 
church was certainly not far away, but its tower no longer bore the 
symbols of knowledge and power; instead the freestanding campanile 
now dominated space - and would soon, as dock-tower, come to 
dominate time too. 

Historians, though loth to acknowledge the subversive character of 
this period, have nevertheless shed light on the unevenness of the process 
involved. The seaboard towns of the Mediterranean easi ly  won munici­
pal freedoms, as did the old cities of the south of France and the cloth­
towns of Flanders. In northern France, on the other hand, it was only 
by violence that towns were able to wrest concessions, franchises, char-I 
ters and municipal constitutions from the bishops and barons. This 
unequal development - unequal  in the degree of violence, unequal in 
terms of success or fai lure - only serves to underscore the rapidity of 
the spread and the extension achieved by the new space. By the four­
teenth century this space, known and recognized now, and hence rep­
resentable, was able to generate purely symbolic towns, founded for the 
purposes of commerce in regions which were sti l l  exclusively agro­
pastora l ,  and where consequently no commercial activity was as yet 
taking p lace. Take for example the bastides of south-western France : 
spaces commercia l  in the strictest sense, egal itarian and abstract in 
nature; townships isolated and sleepy from the start, though glorified 
by names such as Grenade, Barcelone, Florence, Cologne or Bruges.

These places can only be understood as offshoots of the great subversive 
movement of the twelfth century. Yet towns such· as Montauban are 
perfect epitomes of the commercial town - representations of an ideal 
type, complete with a variety of corresponding implications and exten­
sions, among them their secu lar character, their civic and civil organi­
zation, their later adoption, first of Protestantism, then of Jacobinism, 
and so on. 

This space which establ ished itsel f during the Middle Ages, by what­
ever means it did so, whether violent or no, was by definition a space 
of exchange and communications, and therefore of networks. What 
networks ?  In the first p lace, networks of overland routes : those of 
traders, and those of p i lgrims and crusaders . Traces of the imperial 
(Roman) roads were sti l l  discernible, and in many cases these roads 
survived intact. The new networks may be described, specifica l ly, as 
hydraul ic  in  character. The role of the ports and seaboard cities did not 
diminish - far from it . The 'thalassocracy' did not reta in its hegemony 
everywhere, however, and a gradual shift towards the North Sea and 
Atlantic ports tended to put the Mediterranean at a disadvantage. Rivers 
and later canals, together with roads, constituted the new hydraul ic 
web.  The importance of the part pl ayed by in land water transport is 
well known. I t  l inked up the local ,  regional and national markets that 
were a l ready operating and those sti l l  in the process of development 
{ Italy, France, Flanders, Germany) .  This communications network was 
simply the physical reflection - the natural mirror as it were - of the 
abstract and contractua l  network which bound together the 'exchangers' 
of products and money. 

It would be a mistake, though, to define the new space solely in terms 
of  these networks: we must not fa l l  back into the one-way determinism 
of specia l ized scientific discipl ines - of geography or geopol itics. Social 
space is multifaceted:  abstract and practical ,  immediate and mediated. 
Religious space did not disappear with the advent of commercial space; 
i t  was still - and indeed would long remain - the space of speech and 
knowledge. Alongside rel igious space, and even within it ,  there were 
places, there was room, for other spaces - for the space of exchange, 
for the space of power. Representations of space and representational 
spaces diverged, yet the unity of the whole was not shattered. 

Medieva l  space has something miraculous about it .  There is no need 
to cross-section it theoretica l ly - longitudinal ly ,  transversely or vertically 
- to identify orders and estates, ranks and h ierarchies. The social edifice

for homology with the Summa theologica . The top of the socia l  pyramid,

it might be objected, did not reach to the heavens, so there is no analogy 
here. But the point is rather that one and the same illusion sustained 
the belief that the tops of the city's towers grazed the vault of Heaven 
and embodied the celestia l  v i rtues; the belief that those at the tip of the 
social pyramid rubbed shoulders with divinity ;  the belief that reason at 
the zenith of its speculative constructions held out a hand to the faith 
directly dispensed by divine grace ; and the bel ief, finally, that poetry 
may go down into the Inferno and then reascend to Paradise.

into the l ight by the movement of the times. Such 'decrypting' was not 
read, or said, but l ived; the process aroused terror or joy, but was 
general ly persuasive rather than violent. When painting reasserted its 
priority in the Quattrocento it fel l  to the artists to procla im this general 
transition from the cryptic to the decrypted. This  was not the art of the 
visible per se, however. Knowledge was sti l l  knowledge. Decrypting in 
this sense had l itt le to do with the deciphering of a text. Emergence 
from obscurity was an irreversible proceeding, and what emerged did 
so not as a sign but ' in person' .  

Thus time was not separated from space; rather it oriented space -
although a reversa l of roles had begun to occur with the rise of medieval 
towns, as space tended to govern those rhythms that now escaped the 
control of  nature (or of  nature's space ) .  Where was the connection or 
bond between space and time ? Beyond the acquired knowledge of the 
period, no doubt, yet below the level grasped by its theory of knowledge: 
in a praxis, an 'unconscious' praxis, which regulated the concordance 
of time and space by l imiting clashes between representations and coun­
tering distortions of reality .  Time was punctuated by festivals  - which 
were celebrated in space. These occasions had both imaginary (or 
mythica l )  and rea l  (or practica l )  'objects ' ,  al l  of which would appear,

rise, fal l ,  disappear and reappear :  the Sun, the Christ, saints male and 
female, the Great Virgin Mother. As p laces diversified, so did socia l  
t ime:  business t ime ( the t ime of the market ha l l )  ceased to coincide with 
the time of the Church, for its secu larization proceeded hand in hand 
with that of the space to which i t  re lated .  And the time of communal 
counci ls l ikewise ceased to coincide with the t ime of private l i fe.

In the Western Europe of the sixteenth century 'something' of decisive 
importance took p lace. This  'someth ing', however, was not a datable 
event, nor an institutional change, nor even a process clearly measurable 
by some economic yardstick, such as the growth of a particu lar form 
of  production or the appearance of a particu lar  market. The West was 
nevertheless turned upside down. The town overtook . the co11ntry io 
terms o'f frs economic and practical weight, in terms of its soci�(- impO_!'t­
ance; landownersh ip lost its former absolute primacy. Society underwent 
a global change, but one uneven in its effects, as becomes apparent as 
soon as we consider particu lar  sectors, elements, moments or  insti­
tutions. 

N-��h_ere was there an absolute rupture with what had gone before. 
According to one's perspective as one views these few decades, it can 
seem as i f  everyth ing changed or as if everyth ing went on as before. 

Perhaps examining space may help us solve the methodolggigl and 
theoretical problem embodied in the question 'What changedi!l.J.his 
crucial p�riod? '  Transition impl ies mediation. The historical mediation 
between medieval (or feudal )  space and the capita l i st space which was 
to result  from accumulation was located in urban space - the space of 
those 'urban systems' which establ ished themselves during the transition. 
In this period the town separated from the countryside that it had long 
dominated and administered, exploited and protected . No absolute rift 
between the two occurred, however, and their unity, though riven with 
conflict, survived. The town, in the shape of its ol igarchy, continued to 
exercise control over its domains. From the height of their towers, 
'urbanites' continued to contemplate their fields, forests and vi l lages . As 
for what peasants 'are' , the town-dwellers conceived these recently 
converted pagans either as fantasy or as objectors, and accordingly 
treated them with embarrassment or contempt, as something out of a 
fa i rytale or out of a tale of terror. The urbanites located themselves by 
reference to the peasants, but in terms of a distantiation from them: 



FROM ABSO LUTE S !>ACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 269 

there was therefore dual ity in  un ity, a perceived distance and a conceived 
un ity. The town had its own rationa l i ty, the rational ity of calculation 
and exchange - the Logos.([d-ie-merchanr: lo...taking ovez:the reigns of

compromise between the decl in ing feudal system, the commercial bour­
geoisie, ol igarchies, and communities of craftsmen. I t  further became 
abstraction in action - active abstraction - vis-a-vis the space of nature, 
general i ty as opposed to singularities, and the universal principle in statu 
nascendi, integrating specificities even as it uncovered them. Urban space 
was thus a tool of terrifying power, yet it did not go so far as to destroy 
nature ;  i t merely enveloped and commandeered it. Only l ater, in a 
second spiral of spatial abstraction, would the state take over: the towns 
and their burghers would then lose not only control of space but also 
dominion over the forces of production , as these forces broke through 
all previous l imits in the shift from commercial and investment capital 
to industrial capita l .  Surplus value would no longer have to be consumed 
where i t  was produced ; rather, it would be susceptible of realization 
and distribution far away from its source, far beyond the local bound­
aries which had thus far hemmed it in. The economic sphere was 
destined to burst out of its urban context; that context would itself be 
overtu rned in the process, although the town would survive as a centre, 
as the locus of a variety of compromises. . 

The emergence of the new in Europe that we have been discussing 
occurred at a privileged moment, the moment of relative equipoise 
between a decl ining countryside ( i .e .  landownership, agricultural 
production) and a town (i .e. commerce, movable property, urban crafts) 
on the ascendant. Thi�. was the point at which the town was concep­

28  In his  invesrigation of the 'open work' and the 'absenc structure', Umberto Eco 

embraces error and even delusion when, without a shred of supporting evidence, he accepts 
the notion that, thanks to a favourable h isrorical development and the increasing rational ity 
of society, an, culrure and materia l  real i ty ,  this whole complex has in the second ha l f  of 
the twentieth cenrnry become susceptib le of coding and decoding. According to Eco, this 
superior rational ity cakes the form of communication. The communicable is presumably

Truth to tel l ,  the first formulation of such a unitary code dates back 
to antiquity, and specifical ly to Vitruvius .  The work of  the Roman 
architect contains an elaborate attempt to establ ish term-by-term corre­
spondences between the various elements of social l i fe in the context of 
a particular  spatial practice, that of a bui lder working in a city that he 
knows from the inside. The books of  Vitruvius open with an explicit 
statement that  is a sort of premonitory exposure of the naivety of all 
who evoke Saussure's signifier-signi fied distinction and make it the 
cornerstone of their 'science ' :  

In al l  matters, but particu larly in arch itecture, there are these two 
points :  the thing signified, and that which gives it its significance. 
That which is signified is the subject of which we may be speaking; 
and that which gives significance is a demonstration on scientific 
principles. 29 

The Vitruvian books impl icitly embody al l  the elements of a code. 

1 A complete a lphabet and lexicon of spatial elements : water, a i r, 
light, sand, bricks, stones, conglomerates and rubbles, colouring 
materials ,  apertures and closures (doors, windows) ,  etc . ;  also 
an inventory of the materials and materiel (tools) used. 

2 A grammar and a syntax : description of the way the above­
mentioned components are combined into wholes - into houses, 
basil icas, theatres, temples or baths ; and directions for their 
assembly. 

3 A style manual : recommendations of an artistic or aesthetic kind 
concerning the proportions, 'orders' and effects to be sought. 

What is  m issing from the Vitruvian spatial code ? On casual inspection, 
nothing. Everything is apparently covered in this dictionary of  use value 

decipherable, and consequently everything in the culture - each element or aspect of i t -
is said ro consti tute a semiological system. This evolutionistic rationa l ism and this sanguine 
view of the nature of communication (reading/writing) a rc typ ica l embodiments of Eco's 
a lmost charm ing ideological na'ivety. [See Eco, 'La funzione e ii segno: sem iologia dell 'arch­
i tettura', in La struttura assente (Mi lan :  Bompian i , 1 968 ) .  Eng. tr. : 'Function and Sign :

in which exchange va lue has simply no part. Vitruvius suppl ies us with 
a fine analytic tool with which to understand the spatia l  practice of the 
ancient Greek and Roman city, with i ts elaborate representations of 
space ( astronomy, geonomy) and its magico-rel igious representational 
spaces (astrology) .  30 Vitruvius goes into considerable deta i l :  in connec­
tion with modules and mouldings - that is to say, with orders and 
ordonnance - he offers a methodical study, a true systematization of 
both terminology and objects (or 'things signi fied ' ) .  

Nevertheless, for a l l  i t s  thoroughness, the approach init iated by Vitru­
vius's would-be comprehensive treatise on spatial semiology continued 
for many centuries to overlook something essentia l - namely, the analysis 
and explanation of the 'urban effect ' .  The city in Vitruvius is conspicuous 
by its absence/presence ; though he is speaking of noth ing else, he never 
addresses it directly .  It is  as though it were merely an aggregation of 
'publ ic' monuments and 'private' houses (i .e. those owned by the place's 
notabi l it ies ) .  In other words, the paradigm of civic space is barely present 
even though i ts 'syntagmatic' aspects - the connections between its 
component parts - are deal t  with at length . As early as Vitruvi us, then, 
emphasis on the techn ical and empirical a l ready impl ied that operational 
considerations were paramount.

The urban effect is l inked to the archi tectural effect in a unity of 
composition and style. While i t  may be true to say that in the sixteen th 
and seventeenth centuries, beginning with Gal i leo, the 'human being' 
lost his p lace in the 'world'  and Cosmos on account of  the col lapse of 
the Greek unity of 'action, time and space', 3 1  the fact remains that this 
'Renaissance '  being continued to s i tuate h imsel f in  h is  town.  Spatial 
practice and a rchitecture-as-practice were bound up with each other, 
and each expressed the other. So the architect was effective and architec­
ture was ' i nstrumenta l '  The Renaissance town ceased to evolve 'after 
the fashion of  a continuous narrative', adding one bui lding after another, 
an extension to a street, or another square to those a l ready in  existence. 
From now on each bui lding, each addition, was politically conceived ; 
each innovation modified the whole, and each 'object' - as though it  
had h i therto been somehow external - came to affect the entire fabric. 3 2  
The centre-periphery sp l i t  that  would occur later, as cities fel l  apart 
under the impact of industria l ization and stati fication, was not yet in  
the  offing. The dominant contrast for the moment was  between ' inside' 
and 'outside' within the unity of the a rchitectura l effect and the u rban 
effect, 33 the un i ty of the country vil la and the town house. This was the 
time of  Pal ladio. Owing to a substantial istic or natural istic fa l l acy, the 
space of  the Renaissance town has occasional ly been described as 
'organic' ,  as though it had a coherence akin to that of an organism, 
defined by a natural goal-directedness, with the whole governing the 
parts. 

Such a unity, to the extent that it may ever be said to have existed 
in an u rban space, as a 'purposiveness without pu rpose', may most 
appropriately be a scribed to the cities of antiquity .  The concept of the 
organic denotes and connotes a bl ind development leading from b i rth 
to the decl ine of l ife. Can it be said of the medieval town with i ts 
burghers that i t  developed 'organical ly '  - and hence blindly?  Possibly -
but certainly only unti l  that moment when political power, the power 
of  an ol igarchy, of  a p rince or of  a king, asserted itsel f. At that  point 
space was necessari ly transformed. If political power control led the 
'whole', this was because it knew that change to any deta il could change

that whole ; the organic surely now rel inquished the field to the pol itical 
principle. Note, however, that there is as yet no need to evoke any 
abstract and detached category of the ' functiona l '  

For a good many 'positive' minds ,  nothing cou ld be clearer or more 
susceptible of  empirical verification than the supposed 'needs' and ' func­
tions '  of a socia l  rea l i ty conceived of as organic in nature. In point of 
fact, however, noth ing could be more obscu re. Whose needs ? By whom 
are such needs formulated ? And by what are they satisfied or  saturated ? 
We are told that the baths of D iocletian answer to the ' needs' and 
'functions '  of the bath room. To the contra ry, the baths were in the 
highest degree mult ifunctional ,  and they met 'social needs' far more 
than they did 'private' ones ; they were, in short, part of a different 
urban rea l i ty. 

Fai;ade and perspective went hand in hand. Perspective established 
the l ine of fai;ades and organized the decorations, designs and mouldings 
that covered the ir  surfaces . It also drew on the alignment of fai;ades to 
create its horizons and vanishing-points. 

The fai;ade tel ls us much - and much that is surprising. It is curious, 
in view of its a rtificial and studied character, that the fai;ade is  arguably 
the basis for the 'organic' analogy. The notion of fai;ade implies right 
and left (symmetry ) ,  and h igh and low. It a lso implies a front and a 
back - what is shown and what is not shown - and thus constitutes a 
seeming extension into socia l  space of an  asymmetry which arose rather 
late in  the evolution of living organisms as a response to the needs of 
attack and defence. Inasmuch as the prestigious surface of the fai;ade is 
decorative and decorated, and thus in some sense fraudulent, can we 
take a non-disparaging view of it? Certa inly i t  has often been viewed 
otherwise - for example, as a face or countenance perceived as express­
ive, and turned not towards an ideal spectator but towards the particular  
viewer.  By vi rtue of this analogy with a face or countenance, the fai;ade 
became both eloquent and powerfu l .  It was cal led upon to create 
ensembles, to become master of the i nternal ( structu red) disposition of 
space as well as of its own function (which it both fu lfi lled and 
concealed ) .  From this 'perspective', everything was faqade. And, i f  per­
spective governed the arrangement of component elements, of houses 
or other structures, the inverse was equal ly true, for these could a lso be 
said, by v irtue of thei r al ignment and grouping, to give rise to a perspec­
tive. It seems natural enough in th is connection to draw an analogy 
between various (p ictural and architectura l )  artistic forms. A picture, as 
a painted surface, privi leges one dimension, orienting itsel f towards the 
viewer and grouping its subjects, whether inanimate or l iving, according 



274 FROM A BSO LUTE SPACE TO A BSTRACT SPACE 

to the same logic. It i s  a sort of face and a sort of fac;;ade. A painting 
turns in the direction of anyone approaching it - that is, in the di rection 
of  the public. A portrait looks out before, while and after it is looked 
at. A canvas, or a painted wall, has a countenance, one which actively 
invites scrutiny .  Both face and fac;;ade have something of the gift about 
them, something of favour and fervour. Can the fac;;ade effect become 
predominant? Undoubtedly. Expressiveness emanates from the face ; 
dissimulation, therefore, l ikewise. Virtues are presumed to derive from 
it, and i t  is the subject of much proverbial wisdom - consider the 
expression 'saving face' . It is not j ust bui ldings, but also manners and 
customs, and everyday l i fe with its rites and festivals, that can fa l l  under 
the sway of the prestige thus generated. 

Papa l  Rome furnishes a rather good example of a space where the 
fac;;ade was master, where everyth ing was face and fac;;ade. By virtue of 
an easi ly understood reciprocal relationship,  the fac;;ade in this context 
was cause as well as effect :  each building, house or church imposed the 
supremacy of the fac;;ade; every monument was at the same time the 
result of that supremacy. The basic configuration of space applied 
equal ly to the whole and to each deta i l .  Symbolism infused meaning not 
into a single object but rather into an ensemble of objects presented as 
an organic whole. St Peter's in Rome is the Church itself: the Church 
'entire and whole' - body and countenance - ' fastening upon her prey' .  
The prestigious dome represents the head of the Church, while the 
colonnades are this giant body 's arms, clasping the piazza and the 
assembled fa ithfu l  to its breast. The head th inks; the arms hold and 
contain .  I t  seems that one might justifiably spea k here, without over­
general izing, of a culture of the fac;;ade and of the face. As a principle 
more concrete than the 'subject' of the phi losophers, the countenance, 
a long with its complements (masks) and supplements (dress), may cer­
tainly be said to determine ways of l i fe .  

Seductive as th is  hypothesis may be, i t  is l i able to oust a fundamental 
concept, that of production, in favour of an ideological account of 
generation. When an institution loses its b i rthplace, its original space, 
and feels threatened, i t  tends to describe itself as 'organic' .  I t  'natural izes' 
itsel f, looking upon itself and p resenting itse l f  as a body. When the city, 
the state, nature or society i tsel f is no longer clear about what image to 
present, its representatives resort to the easy solution of  evoking the 
body, head, l imbs, blood or nerves. Th is  physical ana logy, the idea of 
an organic space, is thus cal led upon only by systems of knowledge or 
power that are in decl ine. The ideological appeal to the organ ism is  by 
extension an appeal to a unity, and beyond that unity (or short of it) 



FROM A BSOLUTE SPACE TO A BSTRACT SPACE 275 

to an orzgm deemed to be known with absolute certainty, identified 
beyond any possible doubt - an origin that legi t imates and justifies. The 
notion of an organic space implies a myth of origins, and its adduction 
e l iminates any account of genesis, any study of transformations, in 
favour of an  image of continu i ty and a cautious evolutionism. 

The fa<;ade and fa<;ade effects have had an eventful h istory, one that 
traverses the periods of the Baroque, of exoticism and of a variety of 
mannerisms. Only with the rise of the bourgeoisie and of capital ism 
was this principle thoroughly developed. And even then th is was done 
in a contradictory way. Fascism sought to enthrone an organic fantasy 
of socia l  l i fe based on the notions of blood, race, nation, and an absolute 
national state. Hence its use of the fa<;ade, a democratic parody of which 
is to be found in the detached, suburban house, with its front and back 
- its face, as  it were, and its obscene parts.

Between the twel fth and the nineteenth centuries wars would revolve 
around accumulation. Wars used up riches; they also contributed to 
their increase, for war has a lways expanded the productive forces and 
helped perfect technology, even as it has pressed these into the service 
of destruction .  Fought over areas of potential investment, these wars 
were themselves the greatest of investments, and the most profitable. 
Cases in  point a re the Hundred Years War, the Italian wars, the Wars 
of Religion, the Th irty Years War, Louis XIV's wars against the Dutch 
and against the Holy Roman Empire, and the wars of the French 
Revolution and Empire. The space of capital ist accumulation thus gradu­
ally came to l i fe, and began to be fitted out. This process of animation 
is admiringly referred to as h istory, and its motor sough t  in  all kinds 
of factors: dynastic interests, ideologies, the ambitions of the mighty, 
the formation of nation states, demographic pressures, and so on. This 
is the road to a ceaseless analysing of, and searching for, dates and 
chains of  events. Inasmuch as space is  the locus of a l l  such chronologies, 
might i t  not constitute a principle of explanation at least as  acceptable 
as any other ? 

Industry would pitch its tent in a space in which the communitarian 
traditions of the countryside had been swept away and urban institutions 
brought to ru in  by wars (though the l inks between towns, the 'urban 
system', had not disappeared ) .  Th is was the space, pi led h igh with the 



276 F R O M  A BSOLUTE SPACE T O  ABSTRACT SPACE 

rich spoils of years of rapine and pi l l age, wh ich was to become the 
industrial space of the modern state. 

To summarize: before the advent of capital ism, the pare played by 
violence was extra-economic; under the dominion of capitalism and of 
the world market, it assumed an economic role in the accumul ation 
process ;  and in consequence the economic sphere became dominant.  
This i s  not to say that economic rel ations were now identical to relations 
of power, but merely that the two could no longer be separated . We 
are confronted by the paradoxical fact tha t  the centuries-old space of 
wars, instead of sinking into social obl iv ion, became the r ich and thickly 
populated space that incubated capita l ism. This is a fact worth pon­
dering. What fol lowed was the establishment of the world market, and 
the conquest and plunder of the oceans and continents by Europeans -
by Spain, England, Holland and France. Far-ranging expeditions of this 
kind cal led for materia l  resources as much as for goals  and fantasies 
( not that the one excl uded the other) .  Where was this h istorical process 
concentrated ? Where was its point of combustion ? From what crucible 
did a l l  these creative and catastrophic forces flow ? The answer is, those 
regions which to this day are the most i ndustria l ized of Europe and the 
most subject to the imperatives of growth : England, northern France, 
the Netherlands, the lands lying between the Loire and the Rhine. The 
phi losophical abstractions of negation and negativity take on a distinctly 
concrete form when we 'th ink'  them in the context of social and political 
space. 

In  the wake of Marx, many historians have tried to account in 
economic terms for the violence we have been discussing, but in so 
doing they have merely projected a schema applicable enough to the 
imperialist era back onto an earlier time. They have made no attempt 
to understand how the economic sphere achieved its predominance - a 
development which (along with other factors : surplus value, the bour­
geoisie and its state) defines capital ism i tself. Indeed, they have fa iled 
to understand Marx's  thinking on this score - his idea that  the historical 
with its categories was predominant during a specific period, but that 
it was subordinated to the economic sphere in the nineteenth century. 

Does this mean that the 'economistic' explanation of h istory should 
be replaced by a 'polemologica l '  one? Not exactly. War has been unfairly 
classed, however, as a destructive and evi l  force as opposed to a good 
and creative one: whereas economics could lay claim (at least as the 
economists saw it ) to being positively and peaceful ly 'productive', the 
h istorians adjudged wars nothing but evil-hearted actions, the outcome 
of harmful passions - of pride, ambition and excess. The trouble with 



FROM ABSO LUTE SPACE TO ABST R A CT  SPACE 277 

th is apologetic kind of th inking, which is sti l l  fa irly widespread, is that 
it ignores both the role of violence in capitalist accumulat ion and the 
part played by war and armies as productive forces in their own right. 
This was something that Marx had pointed out, and underl ined briefly 
but fi rmly.  What did war produce ? The answer is :  Western Europe -
the space o f  h istory, of accumulation, of investment, and the basis of 
the imperial ism by means of  which the economic sphere would eventu­
ally come into its own. 

Violence is in fact the very l i feblood of this space, of this strange 
body. A violence sometimes latent, or preparing to explode ; sometimes 
un leashed, and d i rected now against itse lf, now against the world ; and 
a violence everywhere glorified in triumphal arches (Roman in origin ) ,  
gates, squares and prospects. 

It was in this space of earth and water, a space wh ich i t  had produced 
and sustained, that war, in Western Europe, deployed i ts contradictory 
- destructive and creative - forces. The Rhine, the North Sea, or the 
canals of  Flanders had as great a strategic importance as the Alps, the 
Pyrenees, or the plains and the mountains. A single rational i ty may be 
discerned in seventeenth -century France in the actions of a Turenne, a 
Vauban and a Riquet - warrior, strategist and engineer respectively. I t  
i s  a rational ity usua l ly  associated with Cartes ian phi losophy, but it 
differs from that phi losophy in the way in  wh ich a social practice does 
differ from an ideology, the correspondence between the two being 
somewhat loose and uncerta in .  

Did those who made h istory - simple soldier or field marsha l ,  peasant 
or emperor - work consciously in the service of accumulation ? Of course 
not. Now that historical time is col lapsing, it is surely incumbent upon 
us to distinguish here, more subtly than was done at the moment when 
that time was first ana lysed, between motives, reasons, causes, a ims and 
outcomes. Pride and ambition were certain ly often motives, for example: 
dynastic conflicts clearly helped cause wars. As for resu lts, they became 
evident only after the fact. We are thus led back to a dia lectical formula 
which is far more acceptable than the historical verities with wh ich the 
dogmatists assail us - I refer to Marx's wel l -known assertion that men 
make their h istory and do not know that they are making it . 

To hold the conception of a whole - in  the event, of a specific space 
- does not release us from the obl igation to examine the detai ls .  The 
period we have been considering witnessed the glory and the decl ine of 
the town . As we have seen, society in the sixteenth century stood at a �ershed. S�nd-·time- were urbanized · - · in other words, the time

move;r}e�t of merchandise, of money and of nascent capital, presupposed 
places of production, boats and carts for transport, ports, storehouses, 
banks and money-brokers . It was now that the town recogn ized itself 
and found its image. I t  no longer ascribed a metaphysical character to 
itself as imago mundi, centre and epitome of the Cosmos . Instead, i t  
assumed its own identity, and began to represent itself graph ica l ly ;  as 
a lready noted, plans prol iferated, plans which as yet had no reductive 
function, which visual ized urban rea l i ty without suppressing the th ird 
- the divine - dimension. These were true tableaux, bird's-eye views; 
the town was putting itself in  perspective, l ike a battlefield, and indeed 
a s iege in progress was often depicted, for war often raged around the 
towns, and they were forever being taken, violated and despoiled. The 
towns were the location of wealth, at once threaten ing (and threatened) 
'objects' and 'subjects' of accumulation - and hence too 'subjects' of 
h istory . 

Throughout these conflicts, despite and because of them, the towns 
achieved a dazzl ing splendour. As the reign of the product began,  the 
work reached the pinnacle of its achievement. These towns were in 
effect works of art themselves, subsuming a multitude of particular 
works : not only paintings, scu lptures and tapestries, but also streets, 
squares, palaces, monuments - in short, architecture. 

XII 

Some theories of the state consider i t  to be the work of political geniuses; 
others deem it the result  of h istory. The second thesis, provided it is not 
based on the conclusions of special ists extrapolating from their particular 
areas of competence ( from law, from political economy, or even from 
political organizations themselves) ,  and provided it achieves a certain 
level of genera l i ty,  rejoins Hegel ianism. 

It is doubtfu l  whether Marx had a ful ly worked-out theory of the 
state, a l though he p romised both Lassalle { letter of 22 February 1 848) 
and Engels { letter of 5 April 1 848 )  that  he would provide one. Certainly 
he left no complete account of the state, any more than he left a complete 
theory of dialectical thought .  He did, however, leave a number of 
fragments on the subject, and a number of not unimportant suggestions._ 



FROM ABSO LUTE S PA C E  TO ABSTRACT SPACE 279 

Marx contested Hegel 's  theory a l l  h i s  l i fe long, dismantling it, appropri­
ating scraps of it, and replacing parts of it. Thus he proposed that a 
socia l  and industrial rational ity be substituted for the state and political 
rational i ty that Hegel had elevated to the status of an absolute; he 
viewed the state as a superstructure and not as the essence and crowning 
ach ievement of  society ; and he introduced the idea of the working class 
as the basis of a transformation that would lead to the withering-away 
of the state. 

I suggest that the weakness not only of Hegel ianism but also of the 
cri tique of Hegel ianism may l ie in a misapprehension of the role of 
space and of the corollary role of violence. For Hegel space brought 
historical time to an end, and the master of space was the state. Space 
perfected the rational and the real - simultaneously. As for violence, 
Hegel made i t  part of h is speculative categories: struggle, active nega­
tivity, war, the expression of contradictions . Marx and Engels for their 
part showed that there could be no such thing as 'pure' and absolute 
violence existing apart from a class struggle, in the absence of any 
'expression'  of an economica l ly  dominant class, for the state cou ld not 
establish itse l f  without ca l l ing upon materia l  resources, without a goa l  
and that  goal ' s  repercussions upon the productive forces and upon the 
relations of  production. Violence was indeed the midwife, but only the 
midwife, of  a progeny conceived without its help .  Neither Marx and 
Engels nor Hegel clearly perceived the violence at  the core of the 
accumulation process (though Marx did consider pirates and corsairs, 
the s ixteenth-century traffic in gold, etc . ) ,  and thus its role in the 
production of a pol i tico-economic space.  This space was of course the 
birthplace and cradle of the modern state. It was here, in the space of 
accumulation, that the state's ' total itarian vocation' took shape, its 
tendency to deem political l i fe and existence superior to other so­
called ' socia l '  and 'cultura l '  forms of practice, while at the same time 
concentrating all such political existence in itsel f and on this basis 
procla iming the principle of sovereignty - the principle, that is  to say, 
of its own sovereignty . It was here that the state was constituted as 
an imaginary and real ,  abstract-concrete ' being' which recognized no 
restraints upon itsel f other than those deriving from relations based on 
force ( i ts relations with its own internal components, and those with its 
congeners - invariably rivals and virtual adversaries ) .  The concept of 
sovereignty, as we have seen, enabled the monarchic state to assert itse l f  
against the Church and the Papacy, and against the feudal lords. I t  
treated the state and its henchmen as 'pol itical society ' ,  dominating and 
transcending civi l society, groups and classes. Even i f, l ike Marx, one 



280_) FROM ABSO LUTE S PACE TO AllSTRACI" SPACE 
proves to one's own satisfaction that the state and its constitution are 
not independent of the relations of production, of classes and their 
contradictions, the fact remains that the state with i ts sovereignty rises 
above these factors and reserves the right to resolve contradictions by 
force. The state legit imates the recourse to force and lays claim to a 
monopoly on v iolence. 

Sovereignty impl ies 'space', and what is more i t  impl ies a space aga inst 
wh ich violence, whether latent or overt, is di rected - a space established 
and constituted by violence. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the 
accumulation process exploded the framework of small medieval com­
munities, towns and cities, fiefdoms and principa l i ties. Only by violence 
could technical, demographic, economic and socia l  possibi l ities be rea l­
ized. The spread of sovereign power was predicated on mil i tary domi­
nation, genera l ly preceded by plunder. In time, states became empires 
- the empire of Charles V and the Hapsburgs, the empire of the tsars, 
then Napoleon's empire and the empire which had Bismarck as its 
strategist. These empires, which antedated imperialism, were themselves 
destined sooner or later to col lapse, fal l ing victim to a space which 
now escaped thei r control .  The nation state, based on a ci rcumscribed 
territory, triumphed both over the city state - though this did survive 
into the nineteenth century, witness Venice and Florence - and over the 
imperial state, whose mil itary capabil i ties were eventual ly overwhelmed. 
The centre-periphery relationship, though i t  existed on a scale as yet 
by no means worldwide, a l ready suggested the l imitations of centra lized 
state power, the vulnerabil ity of a ' sovereign ' centre . 

None of which changes the fact that every state is born of violence, 
and that state power endures only by v i rtue of violence directed towards 
a space. This violence originated in nature, as much with respect to the 
sources mobil ized as with respect to the stakes - namely, wealth and 
land.  At the same time it aggressed all of nature, imposing laws upon 
it  and carving i t  up administratively according to criteria quite a l ien to 
the initial characteristics of either the land or its inhabitants. At the 
same time too, violence enthroned a specific rationality, that of accumu­
lation, that of  the bureaucracy and the a rmy - a unitary, logistical, 
operational and quantifying rational ity which would make economic 
growth possible and draw strength from that growth for its own expan­
sion to the point where i t  would take possession of the whole planet. 
A founding violence, and continuous creation by violent means (by fire 
and blood, in Bismarck's phrase) - such are the hal lmarks of the stare. 
But the violence of the state must not be viewed in isolation: it cannot 
be separated either from the accumulation of capital or from the rational 



Fil.OM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO A BSTRACr SPACE 28 1 

and polit ical principle of unification, which subordinates and totallieS 
the various aspects of socia l  practice - legislation, culture, knowledge, 
education - within a determinate space; namely, the space of the rul ing 
class's hegemony over its people and over the nationhood that it has 
arrogated . Each state claims to produce a space wherein something is 
accompl i shed - a space, even, where someth ing is brought to perfection : 
namely, a un ified and hence homogeneous society. In fact, and in  
practice, what  state and poli tical action i nstitutes, and consolidates by 
every avai lable means, is a balance of power between classes and frac­
tions of classes, as between the spaces they occupy. What, then, is the 
state ? According to the 'pol i ticologists', it is a framework - that of a 
power which makes decisions in such a way as to ensure that the 
interests of certa in minorities, of certain classes or fractions of classes, 
are imposed on society - so effectively imposed, in fact, that they become 
indistinguishable from the general interest .  Fair enough, but we must 
not forget that the framework in question is a spatial one. I f  no account 
is taken of  this spatia l  framework, and of its strength, we are left with 
a state tha t  is simply a rationa l  uni ty - in other words, we revert to 
Hegel ianism. Without the concepts of space and of its production, the 
framework of  power (whether as real i ty or concept) s imply cannot 
achieve concreteness . We are speaking of a space where central ized 
power sets itse lf  above other power and el iminates it; where a sel f­
proclaimed 'sovereign' nation pushes aside any other national ity, often 
crushing it in  the process; where a state religion bars all other rel igions; 
and where a class in  power claims to have suppressed a l l  class d i fferences. 
The relationsh ip between institutions other than the state i tsel f ( for 
instance, university, tax authority, j udiciary) and the effectiveness of 
those institutions has no need of the mediat ion of the concept of space 
to achieve sel f-representation, for the space in which they function is 
governed by statutes (and regu lations for their enforcement) wh ich fal l  
within the political space of the state. B y  contrast the state framework, 
and the state as framework, can not be conceived of without reference 
to the instrumental space that they make use of. Indeed each new form 
of state, each new form of political power, introduces its own particu lar 
way of partition ing space, i ts own particu lar  administrative classification 
of discourses about space and about things and people in space. Each 
such form commands space, as i t  were, to serve its purposes ; and the 
fact that space should thus become classificatory makes i t  possible for 
'a · certain type of non-critical thought simply to register the resultant 
�reality' and accept it at face value. 

An effective examination of space - of poli tical space and of  the 



282 FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE T O  ABSTRACr SPACE 

poli tics of space - ought to enable us to dissolve the antithesis between 
' l iberal '  theories of the state, which define i t  as the embodiment of the 
'common good ' of its ci tizens and the impartial arbiter of their conflicts, 
and 'authorita rian' theories, which invoke the 'general wil l '  and a unify­
ing rationa l i ty as j ustification for the central ization of power, a bureau­
cratico-political system, and the existence and importance of : m  apparat. 

To the aforementioned facets of the production of abstract space may 
be added a general metaphorization which, appl ied to the historical and 
cumulative spheres, transfers them into that space where violence is 
cloaked in  rationa l i ty and a rational ity of unification is used to justi fy 
violence. As a resul t, the trend towards homogeneousness, instead of 
appearing as such , is perceived only through such metaphors as 'consen­
sus', parl iamentary democracy, hegemony, or raison d'etat. Or even as 
the 'spirit of enterprise' .  In  a very particu lar  kind of ' feedback', 
exchanges between knowledge and power, and between space and the 
discourse of power, multiply and are regularized. 

In  this way the capitalist 'tr inity' is establ ished in  space - that tr inity 
of land-capital-labour which cannot remain abstract and which is 
assembled only within an equal ly tri-faceted institutional space : a space 
that is fi rst of a l l  global, and maintained as such - the space of sover­
eignty, where constraints a re implemented, and hence a fetish ized space, 
reductive of differences ;  a space, secondly, that is fragmented, separating, 
disj unctive, a space that locates specificities, places or loca l ities, both in 
order to control them and in order to make them negotiable ;  and a 
space, final ly,  that  is hierarchical, ranging from the lowl iest places to 
the noblest, from the tabooed to the sovereign. 

But this is to run ahead, and we must return to the point we had 
reached in our exposit ion.

The work of Rabelais reveals a surp rising relationship between readable 
and non-readable, between what appears and what remains hidden . 
What is said is apprehended in the mode of something appearing or 
emerging. The 'seen'  (as  opposed to appearances) refers neither to the 
seer nor to the visible, but rather to a nocturnal invisibi l i ty about to be 
exposed to daylight. Hardly are words written down than they announce 
this birth of each th ing and preside over i t .  'But had you opened 
that  box, you wou ld  have found ins ide a heavenly and priceless 



F R O M  ABSO LUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 283 
drug . '34 And what  indeed i s  the  content of the  box - what is i t  
tha t  comes thus  into the  light of day ? The whole of the  past, certainly, 
which has been buried by memory and forgetfu lness ; but the rea l i ty of 
the flesh is also being actualized here. The l iving body is present, as a 
place of transition between the depths and the surface, the threshold 
between hiding-place and discovery ; meanwhile the writer - 'with much 
help from [his] spectacles, fol lowing that a rt by which letters can be 
read that a re not apparent>.15 - uses his magic words to draw secrets 
from the drear realm of Dionysus into the rea lm of Apollo, from the 
crypts and caverns of the body into the clarity of dream and reason. 
The most immediate experience, and the test of the 'physica l ' ,  serve as 
lessons to the h ighest form of knowledge. The emergence of the world 
thus continues apace as the Logos ach ieves its concrete rea l ization . Texts 
refer neither to other texts nor to their contexts ; rather, they refer to 
non-texts. So true is this that Rabelais, inspired master of the word that 
he was, ends up attacking those ' transporteurs de noms' (or ' jugglers­
with-names' )  who replace though t with plays on words or  with attri­
butions based on colours. Such is his frustration that he hails the 
Egyptians' wisdom in using hieroglyphs 'which none understood who 
did not understand' - a veritable cal l  to arms of l istening, of aural 
understanding, against the visua l . 36  

For Descartes and the Cartesians, God never rested. Creation was 
continuous. What is the meaning of th is  thesis of Descartes's, which 
was adopted by Spinoza and Leibniz before being taken to the point of 
absurdity by Malebranche ? 

1 The material world, i .e .  space, continues to exist only inasmuch 
as it is sustained by divine thought, and contained in that 
thought :  produced by it, continual ly and l iteral ly secreted by it 
- an organic mirror of the infinite. 

2 The laws of space, which are mathematical laws, are laid down 
by God and upheld by h im;  nothing escapes them, and math­
ematical calculation reigns in nature because such calculation is 
coextensive with the space produced by God . 

3 Novelty is constantly occurring in nature, even though the 
elements of nature (natures) are perfectly simple - so simple, in 
fact, thac chere is rea l ly  only one, namely geometrical space.

Divine action, l ike human act ion, proceeds a fter the fashion of 
a lacemaker creating extraordinar i ly complex figures from a 
single thread. This metaphor is p roposed in perfect seriousness 
by Descartes h imself (in the Meditations) . Indeed, when 
Descartes says that everything in nature i s  merely figures and 
movement, these terms should be taken not metaphorica l ly  but 
l i tera l ly .  The Cartesian God produces, works, and strives to 
create j ust as finite beings do, even i f  he does not become 
exhausted as a result .  

I t  is in  the context of space that productive labour is thus integrated 
into the essence of the divine. For the Cartesians, God embodies a sort 
of  transcendent unity of labour and nature. Human activity imi tates 
divine creative activ i ty :  on the one hand there is the work of craftsmen, 
as they make themselves masters of nature; on the other hand there is 
knowledge (connaissance) - the knowledge ca l led for by the creative 
(productive) p rocess, no longer the contemplation of antiquity or of the 
Middle Ages, but the Cartesian form of theoretical thought, dest ined to 
be developed, and transformed, by Hegel and Marx. The time of knowl­
edge dominates a spatial order constituted according to the logical laws 
of homogeneity, under the gaze of the Lord and before the eyes of the 
thinking 'subject'. 

The predominance of  the visual (or more precisel y of the 
geometric-visual-spatia l )  was not arrived at without a struggle. 

In  the eighteenth century music was in  command. It was the pilot of 
the arts. On the basis of physical and mathematical discoveries, it 
advanced from the fugue to the sonata and thence to grand opera and 
the symphony. I t  also gave b i rth to an idea with infin ite repercussions 
- the idea of harmony. Musical controversies engaged popular opinion; 
they had phi losoph ical and hence universal impl ications. The philo­
sophes concerned themselves with music, l i s tened to music, and wrote 
about music. 

The space of the eighteenth century, a l ready pol it icized, al ready 
visual-geometric in character, and buttressed by painting and by monu­
mental a rchi tecture (Versa i l les) ,  thus suffered the onslaught of music. 
This onslaught stood also for the revenge of the body and the signs of 
the body upon the non-body and its signs - a campaign commonly 
known as 'eighteenth-century materia l i sm· .  The superiority of the visual  
over the other senses and sense organs was seriously chal lenged by 
Diderot, who pointed out that a bl ind person knew as much, had as 
many ideas, and l ived as 'normal ly '  as someone with sigh t .  Th is a l lowed

the phi losopher to ask what purpose might be served by sight, wh ich 
was apparently j ust a sort of luxury ,  agreeable but not rea l ly  necessary. 
The significance of this phi losoph ical criticism cannot be properly 
grasped unless i t  is placed in the context of the great eighteenth-century 
debates over music and the attendant rise of a powerfu l concept which 
united the Cosmos and the World: the concept of Harmony.

2 The optical (orpi.sual) forniant The ' logic of visua l ization' identified 
-by-&win-P-anofsky as a strategy embodied in the great Gothic cathedrals  
now informs the entirety of social practice. Dependence on the written 
word (Marsha l l  McLuhan)  and the process of spectacularization (Guy 
Debord ) a re both functions of this logic, corresponding respectively to 
each of its two moments or aspects: the first is metaphoric (the act of 
writ ing and what is written, hitherto subsidiary, become essential -
models and focal points of practice) ,  and the second is metonymic (the 
eye, the gaze, the thing seen, no longer mere deta i ls or parts, a re now 
transformed into the total i ty ) .  In the course of the process whereby the 
visual gains the upper hand over the other senses, all impressions derived 
from taste, smell ,  touch and even hearing first lose clarity, then fade 
away al together, leaving the field to l ine, colour and light. In this way 
a part of the object and what i t  offers comes to be taken for the whole. 
Th is aberration, wh ich is  normal - or at least normalized - finds its 
j ustification in the socia l  importance of the wri tten word. Final ly, by 
assimi lation, or perhaps by simulation, a l l  of socia l  l i fe becomes the 
mere decipherment of messages by the eyes, the mere reading of texts. 
Any non-optical impression - a tacti le one, for example, or a muscular 
( rhythmic) one - is no longer anything more than a symbolic form of, 
or a transitional step towards, the visua l .  An object felt, tested by the 
hands, serves merely as an 'analogon' for the object perceived by sight. 
And Harmony, born through and for l isten ing, is transposed into the 
visual rea lm;  witness the a lmost total p riority accorded the a rts of the 
image (cinema, painting) . 

The eye, however, tends to relegate objects to the distance, to render 
them passive. That which is merely seen is reduced to an image - and 
to an icy coldness. The mi rror effect thus tends to become general. 
Inasmuch as the act of seeing and what is seen are confused, both 
become impotent. By the time this p rocess is complete, space has no 
social  existence independently of an intense, aggressive and repressive 
visual ization. I t  is thus - not symbol ica l ly  but in fact - a purely visual 
space. The rise of the visual rea lm entails a series of substitutions and 
displacements by means of which it overwhelms the whole body and 
usurps its role. That which is merely seen (and merely visible) is hard 
to see - but it is spoken of more and more eloquently and written of 
more and more copiously.

Metaphorica l ly ,  i t  symbol izes force, male ferti l i ty, mascul ine violence. 
Here again the part is taken for the whole; phal l ic bruta l i ty does not 
remain abstract, for it is the brutal i ty of poli tical power, of the means 
of constra int :  pol ice, army, bureaucracy. Phal l ic erect i l i ty bestows a 
special status on the perpendicu lar,  proclaiming phal locracy as the orien­
tation of space, as the goal of the process - at once metaphoric and 
metonymic - which instigates this facet of spatial practice. 

Abstract space is not homogeneous; it simply has homogeneity as i ts 
goal ,  its orientation, its ' lens' .  And, indeed, it renders homogeneous. 
But in itsel f  it is multi form. Its geometric and visual formants are 
complementary in thei r antithesis. They are different ways of achieving 
the same outcome:  the reduction of the 'real ' ,  on the one hand, to a 
'plan' existing in a void and endowed with no other qua l ities, and, on 
the other hand, to the flatness of a mi rror, of an  image, of pure spectacle 
under an absolutely cold gaze. As for the phal l ic, it fulfi ls  the extra 
function of ensuring that  'somethi ng' occupies this space, namely, a 
signifier which, rather than signifying a void, signifies a pleni tude of 
destructive force - an i l l usion, therefore, of plenitude, and a space taken 
up by an 'object' bearing a heavy cargo of myth . The use va lue of a 
space of this kind is polit ical - exclusively so. If we speak of it as a 
'subject' with such and such an aim and with such and such means of 
action, th i s  is because there real ly  is a subject here, a political subject -
power as such, and the state as such. 

Thus to look upon abstract space as homogeneous is to embrace a 
representation that takes the effect for the cause, and the goal for the 
reason why that goal is  pursued. A representation which passes itself 
off as a concept, when it is merely an image, a mirror, and a mirage; 
and which, instead of chal lenging, instead of refusing, merely reflects. 
And what does such a specular  representation reflect ? It reflects the 
result sought. 'Behind the curtain there is nothing to see', says Hegel 
ironical ly somewhere. Unless, of course, 'we' go behind the curtain 
ourselves, because someone has to be there to see, and for there to be 
something to see. In space, or behind it, there is no unknown substance, 
no mystery. And yet this transparency is deceptive, and everyth ing is  
concealed : space is i l lusory and the secret of the i l lusion l ies in the 
transparency itself. The apparatus of power and knowledge that is  
revealed once we have 'drawn the curta in '  has therefore nothing of 
smoke and m irrors about it . 



288  FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE T O  ABST RACT SPACE 

Homogeneous in appearance (and appearance is its strength ) ,  abstract 
space is by no means simple. In the first place, there are its constitutive 
dual i t ies. For it is both a result and a container, both produced and 
productive - on the one hand a representation of space (geometric 
homogeneity) and on the other a representational space (the phal l ic) . 
The supposed congruence of the formants of this dual ity serves, however, 
to mask i ts duplicity. For, while abstract space remains an  arena of 
practical action , i t  i s  also an ensemble of images, signs and symbols. It 
is un l imited, because i t  is empty, yet at  the same time it is fu l l  of 
juxtapositions, of p roximities ( 'p roxemics ' ) ,  of emotional distances and 
l imits .  I t  is thus at  once lived and represented, at once the expression 
and the foundation of a practice, at once stimulating and constraining, 
and so on - with each of these ' aspects' depending on (without coinciding 
with) its counterpart. What emerges clearly, all the same, a re the three 
elements of the perceived, the conceived and the l ived (practice, and 
representations in their dual manifestation ) .  

The  individua l 's orientation to  abstract space is accompl ished socia l ly. 
For individuals, for example, the location of the instruments of labour, 
and of the p laces where labour is performed (as wel l ,  natural ly, as the 
ways of getting there) ,  is not separate from the representation by means 
of signs and symbols of the h ierarchy of functions. On the contrary, the 
one i ncludes the other. The underpinnings of a way of l i fe embody and 
fashion that way of l i fe. And position (or location) with respect to 
production (or to work) comprehends the positions and functions of the 
world of production (the division of l abour) as wel l as the hierarchy of 
functions and jobs.  The same abstract space may serve profit, assign 
special status to particular places by arranging them in the h ierarchy, 
and stipulate exclusion ( for some) and integration ( for others ) .  Strategies 
may have mult iple 'targets' ,  envisaging a specific object, putting specific 
stakes into play and mobil izing specific resources. The space of work 
has two complementary aspects :  productive activity and position in the 
mode of production. Any relationship to things in space impl ies a 
rel ationship to space itse lf  (things i n  space diss imulate the 'properties' 
of space as such ; any space infused with value by a symbol is a lso a 
reduced - and homogenized - space ) .  

Spatial practice thus  s imultaneously defines : places - the  relationship 
of local to global ;  the representation of that relationship ;  actions and 
signs ;  the trivia l ized spaces of everyday l i fe ;  and, in opposition to these 
last, spaces made specia l  by symbolic means as desirable or undesi rable, 
benevolent or malevolent, sanctioned or forbidden to particular groups. 
We are not concerned here with mental or l i terary 'places', nor with 



FROM ABSO LUTE SPACE TO A BSTRACf SPACE 289 

phi losoph ical topoi, but with places of a purely political and social kind. 
The upshot is certain global phenomena affecting space as a whole 

(exchange, communications, urbanization, the 'development' of space ) ,  
as  wel l  as a number of compartmental izations, dis integrations, 
reductions and interdictions. The space of a (social) order is hidden in 
the order of space. Operating-procedures a ttributable to the action of a ,  
power wh ich i n  fact has its own location i n  space appear to resul t  from 
a simple logic of space. There are beneficiaries of space, j ust as there 
are those excluded from it , those 'deprived of space ' ;  this fact is ascribed 
to the 'properties' of a space, to i ts 'norms', a lthough in reality something 
very different is at work . 

How is this possible ? How could such capabi l i ties, such efficacy, such 
'real i ty ' l ie h idden with in abstraction ? To this pressing question here is 
an answer whose truth has yet to be demonstrated : there is a violence 
intrinsic to abstraction, and to abstraction's practical ( socia l )  use . 

Abstraction passes for an 'absence' - as distinct from the concrete 
'presence ' of objects, of things. Nothing could be more fa lse. For abstrac­
tion's modus operandi is devastation, destruction (even if such destruc­
tion may sometimes herald creation ) .  Signs have something lethal about 
them - not by virtue of ' latent' or so-ca l led unconscious forces, but, on 
the contrary, by v i rtue of the forced introduction of abstraction into 
nature. The violence involved does not stem from some force intervening 
aside from rational ity, outside or beyond it .  Rather, i t  manifests itsel f 
from the moment any action introduces the rational into the rea l ,  from 
the outside, by means of tools which strike, sl ice and cut - and keep 
doing so unti l  the purpose of  their aggression is achieved. For space is 
also instrumental  - indeed i t  is the most general of tools .  The space of 
the countryside, as contemplated by the walker in search of the natural, 
was the outcome of a first violation of nature. The violence of abstraction 
unfolds in parallel with what we call 'h istory' - the 'h istory' that I have 
reviewed in the preceding discussion, while trying to lay the emphasis 
on this often overlooked side of things. 

Was a precise threshold crossed in the course of the transition which 
I have been outl ining in brief? Was there an exact moment when 
phallic-visual-geometric space vanquished earl ier perceptions and forms 
of perception ? 

Even if one takes a pro-revolutionary stance, it is no longer easy to 
look upon al l  results of the great revolutions as 'beneficia l ' .  The French 
Revolution, for example, gave birth (contradictori ly) to the nation, the 
state, law (modern l aw, i .e .  Roman law revised and ' appropriated ' ) ,  
raJional ity, compulsory mil i tary service, the unpaid soldier, and perma-

nent war. To th is list may be added the disappearance of forms of 
community control over political authori ties that had been enjoyed since 
antiquity .  To say nothing of the bourgeoisie, capitalism - in short, the 
advent of general ized violence. 

Also among revolution's effects, di rect and indirect, was the definitive 
constitution of abstract space, with its phal l ic, v isual and geometric 
formants .  It goes without saying that this effect did not make its appear­
ance as such : i t  was not exactly laid down in  the arti cles of the Napo­
leonic Code. But, as Hegel says, the most creative periods of h istory 
were (and are) the most agonizing. After production, however, comes a 
time for taking stock and (to use a typographical analogy) for imposition . 
A time too, sometimes, for happiness, which is recorded only on history's 
'b lank pages' .  The appearance and ' imposition' of abstract space cannot 
be dated : we are not concerned here with events or institutions in any 
clearly defined sense - even though, by the late twentieth century, the 
resu lts are there plain to see . The formative process involved cannot be 
grasped without transcending the fami l iar  categories of the 'unconscious' 
and the 'conscious' .  Noth ing could be more 'conscious' than the use of 
metaphors, for metaphors are an intrinsic part of discourse, and hence 
of consciousness; but noth ing could be more 'unconscious '  either, i f  one 
considers the content that emerges subsequently, in  the course of usage 
(whether of words or of concepts) . Textual criticism, in the sense of the 
carefu l  and slow amassing of a body of critical knowledge, could play 
an important part here. Might not Romanticism be said to have l ived 
th rough - even if it misunderstood - the transitional moment that 
separated abstract spatial ity from a more unmediated perception ? Was 
the Romantic movement not in fact shot th rough - and hence actuated 
- by this particu lar  antagonism, even i f  it has been ignored in favour 
of more dramatic ones ? Here, in brief, are a few suggestive questions 
in this connection .  

1 ls there not  a certa in Romantic poetry tha t  exists precisely on 
this threshold ? 

2 Is this poetry not the way across the threshold - or at any rate 
the ornament on the grea t porta l ?  

3 Does not rhe poetry o f  a Victor Hugo portend the triumph of 
the visual ,  of the phal l ic ,  and of the now-consecrated geometric 
rea lm ? 

Hugo the 'vis ionary' evokes the abyss, the depths, the 'mouth of dark­
ness ' .  He gives utterance ( to words) .  He wants the l ight to rout the 



FROM ABSOLUTE SPACE TO ABSTRACT SPACE 291 

shadows. He envisions the  victory of the  Logos. Every possible visual 
metaphor is  trundled out with maximum fanfare. The eye (of God, of 
the eternal Father} takes up residence in  the tomb. The sounds of a fi fe 
make lace in the air .  The bleeding hog rises from the dirt where he is 
lying in agony and is suddenly found balancing the scales of eternity, 
face to face with God: 'Le pore sanglant et Dieu se regarderent' .  The 
eye is master of the field. Is this stupidity or genius ?  A fa lse problem. 
The tone is  epic indeed : Vision and Sight, Truth and the Heavens sweep 
to triumph.  As for the enemy, it fades away before this onslaught. All  
those twi l ight peoples, those denizens of the night, gen ies, ancestors or 
demons, a re dispersed with the coming of the day. But what  wil l  that 
day be l ike ? Into what shadows have they disappeared ? What science 
has chased them hence ? Before God, reaper of eterna l  summer. 

Was th is not the threshold ? And has i t  not been crossed ?

Contradictory Space 

I 

No science of space (geometry, topology, etc . )  can brook contradictions 
in the nature of space. If socia l  space itse lf  were constituted by dual i ties 
(or dual  properties) ,  these could not embody contradictions in the nature 
of space, for dual ity does not imply antagonism - on the contrary. If it 
were true that space was the location - or set of locations - of coherence, 
and if  it could be said to have a mental real i ty, then space could not 
contain contradictions. From Heraclitus to Hegel and Marx, dialectical 
thinking has been bound up with time: contradictions voice or express 
the forces and the relationships between forces that clash within a 
h istory (and within h istory in genera l ) .  

The i l lusion of  a transparent, 'pure' and neutra l space - which, 
though phi losophical in origin, has permeated Western culture - is  being 
dispel led only very slowly. We have a l ready seen how complex it is by 
looking at it from many viewpoints - historical, physica l ,  physiological, 
l inguistic, and so on. Social space embodies distinct and distinctive 
'traits '  which attach to the 'pure' mental form of space, without, how­
ever, achieving a separate existence as its external superadded content. 
Their ana lysis tel ls us what it is that confers a concrete (practical) 
existence upon space instead of leaving i t  confined within (mental) 
abstraction .

Should we be content simply to introduce the idea of a 'plural ' ,  'polysco­
pic', or 'polyvalent' space ? No - our analysis needs to be taken further

than that. First of al l ,  we ought to ask ( in fu l ly worked-out terms) the 
following questions. 

1 Is there a logic of space ? If so, how is it to be defined and what 
is its scope ? 

2 Does it have l imits, and if so what are they ? If not, where 
exactly does whatever is  irreducible to logica l form begin ? 

3 Where does thought, starting from the 'pure' form, encounter 
its fi rst obstacle - and what is  that obstacle ? Opacity and 
compactness ? Complexity ? Sensory content and an irreducible 
practice ? A residue resistant to every analytic effort ? 

A crit ique of the Cartesian concept of space dea l ing with i ts extensions 
into modern phi losophy does not ipso facto entail a critrique of spatial 
logic. The fact is that Cartesian space is open to an intuitus. Perfectly 
defined, born as an a l ready adult and mature consciousness of self, and 
hence somewhat separated from the ' real ' ,  from the 'world' ,  the Car­
tesian subject nevertheless miraculously, thanks to divine intervention, 
grasps an 'object' - space - which is the result neither of intellectual 
construction nor of sensory elaboration but which is, rather, given en 
bloc as suprasensory purity, as infinitude. In contrast to such a Cartesian 
intuition, a logic merely determines a network of relationships constitut­
ive of the 'object'. 

Much effort has been expended in contemporary th inking on attempts 
to bring entire sectors of real i ty under the rule of logic, or, to put it 
another way, to treat specific domains as determined and defined in 
accordance with a logical thesis about coherence and cohesiveness, 
equilibrium and regulation. There has thus been a good deal of dis­
cussion of the logic of l i fe, the logic of the socia l ,  the logic of the market, 
the logic of power, and so on - without any prel iminary definition of 
the logical, or of i ts bounds. A desire to avoid dia lectical thought i s  
what lies at  the root of this search for one ' logic' after another; the 
result is a threat to logic itsel f. 

III 

�ogical relationships are relationships of inclusion and exclusion, con- / 
· J unction and disjunction, impl ication and explication, iteration and \ 
'reiteration, recurrence and repeti tion, and so forth . Thus propositions, 
judgements, concepts or chains of concepts may include one another, 



294 CONTRAO I CTOR Y SPACE 

and result from inclusions, or else they may be mutual ly exclusive. Such 
logica l relationships imply neither a pre-existing ' real ity' nor a pre­
existing 'truth ' They may be represented by geometic figures ; thus 
ci rcles, larger ones including smal ler, may serve to symbol ize concepts. 
Such representation merely i l lustrates relations wh ich have no basic need 
of representation, since they are themselves of a strictly formal nature. 
Logical rel ations embody the (necessary and sufficient) rational i ty of 
mathematical relations - that is, relations between figures, sets or groups 
(associat ivity, commutabi l i ty, etc. ) .  

I t  is beyond dispute that relations of inclusion and  exclusion, and of 
impl ication and explication, obtain in practical space as in spatial prac­
tice. 'Human beings' do not stand before, or amidst, social space ;  they 
do not relate to the space of society as they might to a p icture, a show, 
or a mirror. They know that they have a space and that they are in th is 
space. They do not merely enjoy a vision, a contemplation, a spectacle 
- for they act and situate themselves in space as active participants . 
They are accordingly situated in a series of enveloping levels each of 
which implies the others, and the sequence of which accounts for social 
practice. For anthropology, as it examines a so-ca l led archaic or peasant 
society, there is the body ( 'proxemics ' ) ; the dwell ing with i ts ' rooms' ;  
and the vicinity or  community (hamlet or  vi l lage) a long with its depen­
dent lands ( fields under cult ivation or fal low, pasture, wood and forest, 
game preserves, etc . ) .  Beyond these spheres l ies the strange, the foreign, 
the hosti le .  Short of them, the organs of the body and of the senses. 
Like (supposedly) primitive peoples, the chi ld, who, doubtless on account 
of its unproductive and subservient role, is mistakenly viewed as a simple 
being, must make the transition from the space of its body to its body 
in space.  And, once that operation is complete, it must proceed to the 
perception and conceptual ization of space. According to our present 
analysis, these successive achievements start and end with objective 
'properties' - with materia l  symmetries and dupl ications upon which 
inclusions/exclusions are superimposed. For such inclusions embody 
exclusions : there are p laces that are prohibi ted (holy or damned 
heterotopias) for various reasons, and others that a re open of access, or 
to which access is encouraged; in this way parts or subdivisions of space 
are dramatica l ly defined in terms of the opposition between beneficent 
and maleficent, both of which are also clearly distinguished from neutral 
space. 

Relationships of this kind may be figuratively represented by means 
of rectangles or squares : some are included by others, but at the same 
time they include - or are excluded by - yet others. Circles can perform 



CONTR A D I CTO R Y  SPACE 295 

an analogous representational function. Such figures help us understand 
the importance of grids and of the so-ca l led radial-concentric form -
and hence too, at a higher level of complexity, the importance of the 
cylinder and the cube. To understand their importance, though, is to 
l imit that importance - as indeed we did earlier in showing how the 
form is transfigured by whatever aspects of it are apprehended in the 
course of the so-ca l led 'h istorical '  process. 

The theme of iteration or repetition and its consequences 
(combinations of elements, differences induced with in wholes) is encoun­
tered in a good many areas of study. The question is whether we are 
confronted here by a logical structure of such a kind tha t  it may be 
described and grasped from two converging angles of approach, one 
starting out from what is implied, the other from what does the implying 
_ the first from the smal lest wholes d iscerned, the second from the 
vastest and most comprehensive. I f  so, we might reasonably be expected 
to arrive at an al l - inclusive intel l igib i l i ty .  The first approach would 
enumerate parts of space, and thus objects in space ( not just the tools 
of everyday l i fe, of home and work, but a lso the containers of those 
tools - huts, cabins, houses, buildings, streets, squares, and so on, a l l  
duly marked for and by the needs of practical l i fe) . These elements could 
thus be inventoried in a concrete way. The second approach , by contrast, 
would describe space as a whole - the relations constituting society at 
the global level . Once an exact correspondence was attained between 
these two ways of apprehending space - i.e. between impl ication and 
explication - we would be in a posit ion to grasp both the transform­
ations brought about by the active elements within space and the genesis 
of space as an ensemble that is at once social and menta l ,  abstract and 
concrete. 

Anthropology would seem to have confirmed that such a hypothesis 
applies beyond the realm of 'pure' abstraction. Our knowledge of par­
ticular vil lage communities, whether Dogon, Bororo or Basque, or of 
particular towns, be they ancient Greek or modern, indeed embraces 
�urfaces and volumes bound by l inks of mutual implication and charac­

, terized by their overlappings, by more or less complex geometries that 
c.an be represented by figures. Here we indeed find objects and fur­
-�ishings, along with ' rooms', shel ters and family houses ; we also find 
�mpler places, named or designated ( by means of common or proper 
rames) as topoi. And a l l  exhibit a dual ity that refers us back ro the g%,11eral properties of logico-mathematical entities, while at the same 
.. time - in practical terms - making possible multiple trajectories : 
outside-inside, inside-outside, and so on. 



296 CONTRAD ICTO R Y  S 1'1\CE 

Whence the noticeable tendency of present-day anthropology to treat 
space as a means of class ification, as a nomenclature for th ings, a 
taxonomy, on the basis of operations conceived of as independent of 
their content - that is ,  as independent of things themselves . This tendency 
converges with efforts to apply s imi lar procedures, implying an identifi­
cation of menta l and socia l ,  to the family,  1 to exchange and communi­
cation, and to tools and objects themselves. A 'pure' self-su fficient 
knowledge is thus assigned a specific set of determinations :  it is said to 
consist of categorizations implicit in i ts objects . We are dea l ing, there­
fore, with a hypothesis which presents itse l f  not merely as a code capable 
of deciphering a given obscure message (in this instance, social space) , 
but a l so as a thoroughgoing evacuation of the 'object' . 

IV 

An immediate objection may be made to any such reduction of content 
to its ( formal )  container. The fact is that th is procedure abol ishes 
di fferences from the outset, whereas a descriptive approach preserves 
differences in their discreteness and then p lunges into the poorly charted 
realm of the specific. 

In its most extreme form, reductionism entails the reduction of time 
to space, the reduction of use value to exchange value, the reduction of 
objects to signs, and the reduction of 'rea l i ty '  to the semiosphere ; it also 
means that the movement of the dialectic is reduced to a logic, and 
social space to a purely formal mental space. 

What possible justification could there be for conflating an empty, 
Euclidean geometric space that is unaffected by whatever may fi l l  i t  and 
a visual space with well-defined optical properties - both these spaces 
being treated in addition as indistinguishable from the space of a practice 
embracing morphologica l ly privi leged and hierarch ically ordered places 
where actions are performed and objects are located ? The thesis of an 
inert spatial medium where people and things, actions and situations, 

' The prototype of this approach is Claude Lev i-Strauss's Les structures elementaires de

Sturmer and R. Needham (ed. ) :  The Elementary Stmct11res of Kinship, rev . edn (Bosron, 
Mass.: Beacon Press. 1 969 ) .  This work contrives to deal with the family and with social 
relationships without once mentioning sex or eroticism. In this connection see Georges

merely take up their abode, as it were, corresponds to the Cartesian 
model (conceiv ing of things in their extension as the 'object' of  thought) 
which over time became the stuff of 'common sense' and ' cu l ture' . A 
picture of mental space developed by the phi losophers and epistemo­
logists thus became a transparent zone, a logical medium. Thencefor­
ward reflective thought felt that social space was accessible to it. In fact, 
however, that space is the seat of a practice consisting in more than the 
application of concepts, a practice that a lso involves misapprehension,  
blindness, and the test of l ived experience. 

Is there such a thing as a logic of space ? Yes and no. In a way 
mathematics as a whole constitutes a logic of space. Space conceived of 
in its 'puri ty ' ,  however, as Lei bniz clearly showed, has neither component 
pans nor form. I ts parts are indiscernible, in which respect it closely 
resembles 'pure '  identi ty - itsel f empty because of its 'purely '  formal 
character. Before any determination can exist here, some content must 
come into play.  And that  content is the act which recogn izes parts, and, 
within those recognized parts, an order - and hence a time. Otherwise, 
differences cou ld not be thought - only thought about. To the question 
whether symbolic logic can be given expression without appealing to a 
before and an a fter, to a left and a right, or to symmetries and asymmet­
ries, Lewis Carrol l ,  for one, has shown that the answer is 'no' . 2  A 
logician of genius, Carroll clearly points up a l l  the steps between pure 
form and the diversity of ranked contents; the l atter he presents one by 
one along the way, fu l ly aware of each 's import and raison d'etre. He 
links the mental to the social in terms of  the mediating role of words, 
signs, doubles or shadows, and games (Alice, the looking-glass, etc. ) .  The 
extension of these mediations is very great, irreducible yet conceivable 
(representable) . Logic, so far from sitting in judgement over the con­
fusion of orders, dimensions and levels, in fact only achieves concreteness 
in the process of discriminating between them . By pointing out and 
labelling the work of metaphor, logic effectively h inders i ts operation . 
The most pernicious of metaphors is the analogy between mental space 
and a blank sheet of paper upon which psychological and sociological 
determinants supposedly 'write '  or inscribe their variations or variables. 
This is a metaphor used by a large number of authors, many of them 

' See Lewis Carrol l ,  Symbolic Logic and The Game of Logic ( New York: Dover, 1 955) ,

h igh ly esteemed,3 who often seek to lend it the authority either of 
phi losophy in genera l or of particu lar phi losophers .4  What can be 
clearly seen by reading such authors is the way in  which technicizing, 
psychologizing or phenomenological ly oriented approaches displace the 
analysis of social space by immediately replacing i t  with a geometric -
neutra l ,  empty, blank - mental space. Consider for instance how 
Norberg-Schulz ,  a theoretician of space, defines a centre, namely as the 
point made by the pencil on a blank sheet of paper. From this perspective 
the marking-out of space has no aim or meaning beyond that of an 
aide-memoire for the (subjective) recognit ion of places ; Norberg-Schulz 
postulates an Eigenraum that is close (no pun intended) to the proxemics 
of the anthropologist Hal l . 5  Thus objective space and the subjective 
image of space - the mental and the socia l  - are simply identified. 

The ult imate effect of descriptions of this k ind is either that everything 
becomes indistinguishable or else that rifts occur between the conceived, 
the perceived and the directly l ived - between representations of space 
and representational spaces. The true theoretical problem, however, is 
to rela te these spheres to one another, and to uncover the mediations 
between them. 

The emphasis thus comes to be laid on an illusory space deriving 
neither from geometrical space as such ; nor from visual space ( the space 
of images and photographs, as of drawings and plans) as such ; nor even 
from practical and directly experienced social space as such ; but rather 
from a telescoping of al l  these levels, from an osci l lation between them 
or from substitutions effected among them. In this way, for example, 
the visual rea lm is confused with the geometrical one, and the optical 
transparency (or legibi l ity) of the visual is mistaken for logico-mathemat­
ical inte l l igibi l ity. And vice versa. 

So what has to be condemned here, in the last analysis, is both a false 
consciousness of abstract space and an objective falseness of space itself. 
There is a 'common sense' for which the visual order that reduces objects

to writ ing as to contentless abstraction. Th is  modus operandi has even 
graver consequences inasmuch as the space of the mathematicians, l ike 
any abstraction, is a powerful means of action, of domination over 
matter - and hence of destruction. By itsel f, the visual realm does no 
more than subl imate and dissolve the body and natural energy as 
such ; in combination, however, it acquires the disquieting abi l i ty to 
compensate for the impotence of pure looking by means of the power 
of technical agencies and of scientific abstraction. 

Our present analysis wi l l  not attain its fu l l  meaning unt i l  political 
economy has been reinstated as the way to understand productive 
activ i ty .  But a new political economy must no longer concern i tself with 
th ings in space, as did the now obsolete science that preceded it; rather, 
it wil l have to be a pol itical economy of space (and of its production) .  

For the purposes of the present discussion, we may leave aside such 
considerations as accelerating technology, unfettered demographic 
expansion, and ecological dangers - al l  of which supply additional 
justification for such a foregrounding of space. Our approach here is a 
response to the impossibi l ity of envisaging the pul lu l ating humanity of 
the future (and, in some pares of our world, of the present) without at 
once raising the issue of space and its attendant problems. I t  should be 
emphasized en passant that this approach is to be sharply distinguished 
from a phi losophy, or from a phi losophical attitude, because it is 
founded on a practice, and a practice which is restricted neither to 
architecture nor to so-cal led town-planning, but which is broad enough 
to embrace overal l  social practice as soon as reflective thought comes 
to grips with the economic and pol itical spheres. 

At this stage in our investigation, what have we established ? A few 
propositions, certainly .  For mental and social to be reconnected, they 
first have to be clearly distinguished from one another, and the 
mediations between them re-established. The concept of space is not in 
space. Likewise the concept of time is not a time within time. Of this 
the philosophers have long been aware.  The content of the concept of  
space is not  absolu te space or space- in- itself; nor  does the  concept 
contain a space within itself. The concept 'dog' does not bark. Rather, , 
the concept of space denotes and connotes a l l  possible spaces, whether \ 
abstract or ' real ' ,  mental or socia l .  And in particular it has two aspects : . 
representational spaces and representations of space. 

Confusion has a risen, however, due to the fact that the phi losophers, 
in their capacity as epistemologists, have envisaged spaces after the 
fashion of mathematicians :  as Cartesian spaces for the classification of 
_knowledge. They have thus proceeded as though the concept of space i

engendered or produced (menta l )  space. As a consequence, thought has 
been left in  the unhappy position of having to plump either for a spl it 
between mental and socia l  or else for a confused mixture of the two. 
The first choice meant accepting a chasm between the logica l ,  mathemat­
ica l ,  and epistemological realms on the one hand, and practice on the 
other. The second imposed an implacable systematizing and absolutely 
a l l - inclusive logic of  society, of the social (and spati a l )  res, of the 
commodity, of capital, of the bourgeoisie, of the capital ist mode of 
p roduction, and so on. 

'True space' was thus substituted for the 'truth of space' ,  and appl ied 
to such practical problems as those of bureaucracy and power, rent and 
profit, and so on, so creating the i l lusion of a less chaotic real i ty ;  social 
space tended to become indistinguishable from the space of planners, 
polit icians and administrators, and arch itectural space, with i ts social 
constructed character, from the (mental )  space of arch i tects. 6

Around 1 9 1 0  academic painters were sti l l  painting 'beautifu l '  figures in 
an 'expressive' way: faces that were moving because they expressed 
emotions - the emotions of the painter - and desirable nudes giving 
voice to the desires of spectator and painter a l ike .  The pictoria l  avant­
garde, meanwhi le ,  were busily detach ing the meaningfu l from the 
expressive. They were not too dearly aware of this, however, for they 
were no great manipulators of concepts. Yet through their experimental 
activity these painters were acute witnesses to the beginnings of the 
'crisis of the subject' in the modern world. In thei r pictorial practice they 
clearly apprehended a new fact, one bound up with the disappearance of 
a l l  points of reference: the fact, namely, that only signifying elements 
could be communicated, because only they were independent of the 
'subject' - that is, of the author, of the artist, and even of the spectator 
as an individual .  This meant that the pictorial object, the painting, arose 
neither from the imitation of objective real i ty (a l l  of whose points of 
reference - traditional space and time, common sense, perception of the 
' rea l '  defined by analogy with nature - were disappearing), nor from 
an 'expressiveness' bound up with emotions and feel ings of a subjective 
kind. In their p ictures these painters subjected the 'object' to the worst

- and before long the ult imate - atrocities. And they set about this work 
of breaking and dislocating with a wi l l .  Once the rift between 'subject' 
and 'object' had been opened, there were no l imits. So wide did this r i ft 
become, indeed, that something else was able to emerge. 

I f  we are to believe the most authori tative commentators, the turn ing­
point was 1 907.7  It was at this time that Picasso discovered a new way 
of painting: the entire surface of the canvas was used, but there was no 
horizon, no background, and the surface was s imply divided between 
the space of the painted figures and the space that surrounded them. 8 
Whereas Matisse during the same period was perfecting the rhythmic 
treatment of the picture surface, Picasso bent his v igorous efforts to its 
structuring; indeed he went beyond structuring ( to put i t  in the terms 
of a later date) and rendered it 'd ialectica l '  through high ly  developed 
antagonism of line and plane rather than of colour, rhythm or back­
ground. He was not dismantling the p icture surface alone, but objects 
too, so setting in tra in  that paradoxical process whereby the thi rd 
dimension (depth) was at once reduced to the painted surface and 
restored by v irtue of the s imultaneity of the multip le aspects of the thing 
depicted (analytical cubism) .  What we have therefore, a l l  at once, are: 
the objectified end of points of reference (of Eucl idean space, perspective, 
horizon l ine, etc. ) ;  a space at once homogeneous and broken ; a space 
exerting fascination by means of its structure ; a dialectical process 
initiated on the basis of antagonisms (paradigms) which does not go so 
far as to fracture the picture's unity; and an absolute visualization of 
things that supersedes that incipient dialectical framework. 

The dissociation between the expressive and the meaningfu l  and the 
l iberation of the signifier had enormous consequences. The more so, 
because these developments were not confined to painting. Pride of place 
is given to painting here on account of its special relationship to space 
at the moment under considera tion. In the first p lace, the l iberation in 
question went so far as to affect the signification itself, in tha t  the sign 
(the signifier) became detached from what is  designated ( the signified ) .  
The sign was  now no longer the  'object' but rather the  object on the 
canvas - and hence the treatment received by the objective rea lm as (at 
the same time and at one stroke) i t  was broken up, disarticu lated, and 
made 'simultaneous' .  As for the 'signified', i t  remained present - but 

' 7  Cf. Wilhelm Boeck and Ja ime Sabartes, Picasso (New York and Amsterdam: Harry 
1'J. Abrams, 1 955 ) ,  p. 1 42 :  'Unl ike the many-figured paintings of 1 906, Les demoiselles 
d'Avignon shows no space surrounding the figures . '

hidden. It was thus also (and above a l l )  disquieting, evoking neither 
pleasure, nor joy, nor ca lm - only in tel lectual interest and most l ikely 
anxiety. Anxiety in  face of what ?  In face of the shattered figures of a 
world in pieces, in face of a disjointed space, and in face of a piti less 
' real ity' that cannot be distinguished from its own abstraction, from its 
own ana lysis, because it ' is '  a l ready an abstraction, a l ready in effect an 
analytics. And to the question of what  takes the place of subjectivity, 
of expressiveness, the answer i s :  the violence which is un leashed in the 
modem world and lays waste to what exists there. 

To return to the case of Picasso, there is noth ing simple about it, and 
we should indeed treat it as a 'case' rather than joining the pathetic 
chorus of the cultists. The notion that Picasso is a revolutionary artist 
( ' revolutionary' because 'communist' ) who - his ' communism' notwith­
standing - has conquered the bourgeois world and so achieved universal 
glory, is the product of  a horrifying naivety, i f  only on the grounds that 
the 'communist world' has in fact never accepted h im.  Picasso has in 
no sense conquered the world - nor has he been co-opted. Init ial ly, he 
supplied the 'vision' that the existing world implied and awaited, and 
he did so just as the crisis broke, j ust as a l l  the reference points were 
evaporating and violence was being unleashed. He did so in parallel 
with imperial ism - and with the Great War, which was the first sign 
that a world market was at last becoming establ ished, and the earliest 
figure of the 'world ' .  In paral lel ,  too - and s imultaneously - with the 
Bauhaus, or, in other words, with abstract space. Which, again, is not 
to say that Picasso was the cause of that space ; he did, however, signify 
it . 

Picasso's space heralded the space of modern ity. It does not fol low that 
the one produced the other. What we find in Picasso is an unreservedly 
visual ized space, a dictatorship of the eye - and of the phal lus; an 
aggressive vir i l i ty, the bul l ,  the Mediterranean male, a machismo, 
(unquestionable genius in the service of genital ity) carried to the point 
of self-parody - and even on occasion to the point of sel f-criticism. 
Picasso's cruelty toward the body, particularly the female body, which 
he tortures in a thousand ways and caricatures without mercy, is dictated 
by the dominant form of space, by the eye and by the phal lus - in short, 
by violence. Yet this space cannot refer to itse l f  - cannot acknowledge 
or admit its own character - without fal l ing into sel f-denunciation. And 
Picasso, because he is a great and genuine artist, an artist who made of 
art an  a l l -consuming fire, inevitably gl impsed the coming dialectical 
transformation of space and prepared the ground for i t ;  by discovering 
and disclosing the contradictions of a fragmented space - contradictions 



CONTRAD I CT O R Y  SPACE 303 

which reside in h im,  and in all his works whether given form or not -
the painter thus bore witness to the emergence of another space, a space 
not fragmented but differential in  character.

During this same period, Frank Lloyd Wright set out to abolish enclosing 
walls designed to separate the inside from the outside, interior from 
exterior. The wall was reduced to a surface, and this in turn to a 
transparent membrane. Light flooded into the house, from each of 
whose ' rooms' nature could be contemplated. From this moment on, the 
mater ia l i ty of thick and heavy walls rel inquished its leading architectural 
role. Matter was now to be no more than an envelope for space, ceding 
its hegemony to the l ight wh ich inhabited that space. Following the 
tendency of phi losophy, of art and l i terature, and of society as a whole, 
towards abstraction, visual ization and formal spatial relations, 'architec­
ture strove for immateria l i ty' . "'  

Before long, however, a disj unction manifested itself that had  not 
emerged at  the outset. Wal ls having lost their importance (whether as 
walls or as curtains) ,  interior space was l iberated . The fai;:ade vanished 
(though it would reappear in the fascist era, with its pomp and brutality 
even more p ronounced, its monumentality more oppressive than ever), 
and this led to a sundering of the street . The disarticu lat ion of external 
space ( fai;:ades, building-exteriors) may be clearly observed in Le 
Corbusier, as much in his written works as in his bui ldings. Le Corbusier 
claims to be concerned with ' freedom ' :  freedom of the fai;:ade rela tive 
to the interior plan,  freedom of the bearing structure relative to the 
exterior, freedom of the disposition of floors and sets of rooms relative 
to the structural frame. In  actuality, what is involved here is a fracturing 
of space : the homogeneity of an architectural ensemble conceived of as 
a 'machine for l iving in', and as  the appropriate habitat  for a 
man-machine, corresponds to a disordering of elements wrenched from 
each other in such a way that the urban fabric i tself - the street, the 
city - is also torn apart. Le Corbusier ideologizes as he rationalizes -
unless perhaps it is the other way round. An ideological discourse upon 
nature, sunshine and greenery successful ly concealed from everyone at 
this t ime - and in particular  from Le Corbusier - the true meaning and

content of such architectural projects . Nature was in fact a l ready reced­

ll1e belief that artists, plastic artists, are in some way the cause or ratio 
of space, whether arch itectural ,  urbanistic, or global, is the product of 
the na"ivety of art historians, who put the socia l  sphere and social 
p ractice in brackets and consider works as isolated entities. I t  is worth 
stressing this point, because what we are considering here was a change 
of course, not only in the history of art but also in the history of modern 
society and its space. That painters paved the way for the architectural 
space of the Bauhaus is indisputable .  But how exactly did they do so ? 
Just about the same time as Picasso, other great artists such as Klee and 
Kandinsky were inventing not merely a new way of painting but a lso a 
new 'spatia l ity' .  It is possible that they went even further than Picasso 
in this direction - especia l ly  Klee. The object (painted on the canvas) 
was now apprehended in a perceptible - and hence readable and visible 
- relationship to what surrounded it, to the whole space of the picture. 
In Klee's work, as in Picasso's, space is detached from the 'subject' , from 
the a ffective and the expressive; instead, it p resents i tsel f as meaningful . 
Picasso, however, projects the object's various aspects onto the canvas 
s imultaneously, as  analysed by eye and brush, whereas for Klee thought, 
guided by the eye and projecting itself onto the painted surface, actually 
revolves around the object in order to situate it . Thus the surroundings 
of the object become visible. And the object-in-space is bound up with 
a presentation of space itse l f. 

It fel l  to the painters, then, to reveal the socia l  and political transform· 
ation of space. As for the architecture of the period, it turned out to be 
in the service of the state, and hence a con formist and reformist force 
on a world scale. ll1is  despite the fact that its advent was ha i led as a 
revolution - even as the anti-bourgeois revolution in archi tecture ! The 
Bauhaus, j ust l ike Le Corbusier, expressed (formulated and met) the 
architectural requirements of state capita l ism ; these differed l i ttle, in 
point of fact, from the requirements of state socia l ism, as identified 
during the same period by the Russian constructivists. The constructivists 
displayed more imagination ( in the utopian mode) than their Western 
counterparts ; and, whereas they were characterized as reactionaries in 
their country, their Bauhaus contemporaries were dubbed subversives. 
This con fusion has a l ready persi sted for ha l f  a century and is still far

from having been dispel led : ideology and utopianism, inextricably bound 
up with knowledge and will, both remain vigorous. In the rea lm of 
nature rediscovered, with its sun and l ight, beneath the banner of l i fe, 
metal  and glass sti l l  rise above the street, above the real i ty of the city. 
Along with the cult of rectitude, in  the sense of right angles and straight 
lines. The order of power, the order of the male - in short, the moral 
order - is thus naturalized. 

There is nevertheless a strange contrast between the creative effer­
vescence of the period we have been discussing, just before and j ust 
after the First World War, and the steri l i ty of the second post-war era. 

VIII 

In the 'advanced' - i .e. the industria l ized - countries, the inter-war years 
saw the beginnings of fragmentation in  the kind of thinking about space 
that took place outside (or beyond) classical phi losophy, as a lso outside 
the sphere of aesthetics proper - the kind of thinking, therefore, that 
sought some connection with ' real ity' .  In crude outl ine,  theses were put 
forward on 'cultural space'  which were then contested - on the face of 
it, at any rate - by theses on behavioural space. Culturalist anthropology 
was opposed not by the l iberal humanism bequeathed by the nineteenth 
century, but rather by behaviourist psychology. And the two doctrines 
came together in the United States. 

The ethnologists and anthropologists (among whom we should once 
again cite Mauss, Evans-Pritchard, and Rapoport) tended to project 
onto the present and future their often sophisticated analyses of societies 
as far removed and isola ted as could be imagined from history, from 
cities, from industrial technologies. So far from relegating descriptions 
of peasant or tribal dwel l ings to the rea lm of folklore, this school of 
thought sought inspi ration therein .  The success enjoyed by this approach 
must be attributed to the fact that it evades modernity (in its capitalist 
form) and promotes mimesis, in the sense of a propensity to reason by 
analogy and to reproduce by means of imitation . Thus the theory of  
cultural space was  transformed into a cultural model of space. 

This static conception was countered by another - equally static -
according to which space as directly experienced was indistinguishable 
from a set of conditioning factors and could be defined in terms of 
. .  reflexes. At least th is  theory did not p lace a desiccated abstraction, 
•namely culture, in the foreground. Jr  even went so far as to assign the 
cultural sphere to the category of ' representational spaces' , so indirectly

ra1smg the question of the relationsh ip between ideology and meta­
physics. On the other hand, it suffered from all the shortcomings com­
mon to capitalist behaviourism and its 'socia l ist '  competitor, Pavlovian 
theory. Reductionistic in its core, this attitude excl uded a l l  inventiveness 
and conjured away the need for a new space to be created as the 
precondition of a new l i fe (not that the mere invention of space is the 
sufficient condition of a new l i fe) . 

IX 

What may be concluded from the foregoing considerations is the con­
verse of a Cartes ian axiom : abstract space cannot be conceived of in 
the abstract. It does have a ' content' ,  but this content is such that 
abstraction can 'grasp' it only by means of a practice that deals with it. 
The fact is that abstract space contains contradictions, which the abstract 
form seems to resolve, but wh ich are clearly revealed by analysis . How 
is this possible ? How may a space be said to be at once homogeneous 
and divided, at once unified and fragmented ? The answer l ies first of 
a l l  - and this has noth ing whatsoever to do with any signifier-signified 
relationship supposedly immanent to space - in the fact that the ' logic 
of space', with its apparent significance and coherence, actual ly conceals 
the violence inherent in abstraction.  Just as violence is intrinsic to tools 
in general (since tools cut, sl ice, assai l  and brutal ize natural materials), 
and to signs in  general , it is also of necessity immanent to instrumental 
space no matter how rational  and stra ightforward this space may appear. 
But at this point our analysis needs to be carried a step further. 

Today it is easier for us to understand, since such notions have entered 
the 'culture ' ,  that exchange value, the commodity, money and capital 
are concrete abstractions, forms having a social existence ( just like 
l anguage, which has caused so much ink to flow - and j ust like space) 
but needing a content in order to exist socia l ly .  Capital inevitably 
subdivides and disperses as individual 'capita ls ' ,  but this does not mean 
that it fai ls to retain its unity or ceases to constitute a whole - that 
being a necessary condition of its operation (as  capital market) .  Fractions 
of capital enter into conflict with one another - commercia l  capital, 
industria l  capital ,  investment capital, finance capital - yet the formal 
unity of capital subsists. The form persists, subsuming all such 'frac­
tions' . And indeed the social ly ' real '  appearance it presents of itself is . 
that of unity, of capital per se. I ts true heterogeneity, its conflicts and 
contradictions, do not appear as such . Likewise in the case of property, 



CONTRADICTO R Y  SPACE 307 
which is divided into immovable and movable property, landed property 
and money . As for the market, its fragmentation, with which we are 
quite fami l iar, is part of i ts very concept: there is the market in commodi­
ties (which a one-sided interpretation of Marxism places above a l l  
others ) ,  the  capital market, the  labour market, the  market in land 
(construction, housing - and hence space) ,  and the markets in works of 
art, in s igns and symbols, in  knowledge, and so on . 

Abstract space can only be grasped abstractly by a thought that is 
prepared to separate logic from the dialectic, to reduce contradictions 
to a false coherence, and to confuse the residua of that reduction ( for 
example, logic and social practice ) .  Viewed as an instrument - and not 
merely as socia l  appearance - abstract space is first of al l  the locus of 
nature, the tool that  would dominate i t  and that  therefore envisages its 
(ultimate) destruction. This same space corresponds to the broadening 
of that ( socia l )  practice which gives rise to ever vaster and denser 
networks on the surface of the earth, as a lso above and below it .  It 
further corresponds, however, to abstract labour - Marx's designation 
for labour in genera l, for the average social labour tha t  produces 
exchange value in general - and hence the genera l form of the com­
modity ; abstract labour is in no way a menta l abstraction,  nor is i t  a 
scientific abstraction in the epistemological sense ( i .e .  a concept separ­
ated from practice so that i t  can be inventoried and incorporated into 
an absolute knowledge ) ;  rather, it has a social existence, j ust as exchange 
value and the value form themselves have. If one. were to try and

political use, however - rather the opposite; the space of state domi­
nation and of (mil itary) violence is  also the space where strategies are 
put into effect. But its rational i ty (and it is a l imited one) has something 
in common with the rational i ty of the factory - al though one cannot 
go so far as to assume any precise parallelism between the technical and 
social divisions of labour. It is in this space that the world of commodities 
is deployed, along with a l l  that it entai l s :  accumulation and growth, 
.calculation, planning, programming. Which is to say that abstract space 
.is that space where the tendency to homogenization exercises its pressure 
and i ts repression with the means at its disposal :  a semantic void 

:abolishes former meanings (without, for all that, standing in the way of 
:the growing complexity of the world and its mult ipl icity of messages, 
codes and operations ) .  Both the vast metaphorization which occurs as

308 CONTRA D I CfOR Y SPACE 
of the process of accumulation, and which transports the body outside 
of itself in  a paradoxical kind of al ienation, lead equal ly to this same 
abstract space. This immense process starts out from physical truth (the 
presence of the body) and imposes the primacy of the written word, of 
'plans' ,  of the visual rea lm, and of a flatten ing tendency even with in  
that realm itse lf. Abstract space thus s imultaneously embraces the 
hypertrophied analytic intellect; the state and bureaucratic raison d 'etat; 
'pure' knowledge ; and the discourse of power. Implying a ' logic' which 
misrepresents it and masks i ts contradictions, this space, which is that 
of bureaucracy, embodies a successfu l integration of spectacle and viol­
ence (as dist inct from 'pure'  spectacle ) .  Lastly, we find that abstract 
space so understood is hard to distinguish from the space postu lated by 
the ph i losophers, from Descartes to Hegel, in their fusion of the i ntel l i ­
g ible (res extensa) with the polit ica l  - their fusion, that is to say,  of 
knowledge with power.  The outcome has been an au thoritarian and 
brutal spatial practice, whether Haussmann ' s  or the later, codified ver­
sions of the Bauhaus or Le Corbusier; what is involved in a l l  cases is 
the effective appl ication of the analytic spir it in and through dispersion, 
division and segregation. 

The space that homogenizes thus has nothing homogeneous about it. 
After its fash ion, which i s  polyscopic and p lural ,  i t  subsumes and unites 
scattered fragments or elements by force . Though it emerged h istorically 
as the plane on which a socio-political compromise was reached between 
the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie ( i . e .  between the ownersh ip of land 
and the ownersh ip  of money ) ,  abstract space has maintained its domi­
nance i nto the era of conflict between finance capital - that supreme 
abstraction - and action carried out in the name of the proletariat. 

x 

The space developed by avant-garde artists, by those artists who regis· 
tered the col lapse of the old points of reference, introduced itself into 
this fabric m· tissue as a legitimating ideology, an ideology that j ustifies 
and motivates. These artists presented the object within the space of the 
dominant social  practice. Meanwhile, the architects and city-planners 
offered - as an ideology in action - an empty space, a space that is 
primordial , a container ready to receive fragmentary contents, a neutral 
medium into wh ich disjointed things, people and habitats might be 
introduced. In other words:  incoherence u nder the banner of coherence; 
a cohesion grounded in scission and disjointedness, fluctuation and the 



CONTRA D I CTOR Y  SPACE 309 
ephemeral masquerading as stabi l ity ,  conflictua l  relationships embedded 
within an appearance of logic and operating effectively in  combination. 

Abstract space has many other characteristics also. I t  is here that 
desire and needs are uncoupled, then crudely cobbled back together. 
And this is the space where the middle classes have taken up residence 
and expanded - neutral, or seemingly so, on account  of their social and 
political posit ion midway between the bourgeoisie and the working 
class. Not that this space 'expresses ' them in any sense; i t  i s  simply the 
space assigned them by the grand p lan :  these classes find what they seek 
_ namely, a mirror of their ' real i ty ' ,  tranqui l l izing ideas, and the image 
of a socia l  world in which they have their own specia l ly label led, 
guaranteed place .  The truth is, however, that this space manipulates 
them, along with their unclear aspirations and their a l l -too-clear needs. 

As a space where strategies are applied, abstract space is also the 
locus of a l l  the agitations and disputations of m imesis: of fash ion, sport, 
art, advertising, and sexual i ty transformed into ideology. 

XI 

In abstract space, where an anaphorization occurs that transforms the 
body by transporting it outside itse lf  and into the ideal-visual realm,  
we also encounter a strange substitution concerning sex . In  i t s  init ial ,  
natural form, the sexual relationship implies a certa in reciprocity ; at a 
later stage this bond may be abstractly j ustified and legitimated in a 
'way that changes it into a socia l  rea l i ty (often wrongly described as 
"cultural ' ) .  Physical reciprocity is legalized as contractual reciprocity, as 
a 'commitment' witnessed and underwritten by authority. During this 
process, however, the original bond undergoes a dangerous modification .  

The space where this substitution occurs, where nature is replaced by 
cold abstraction and by the absence of pleasure, is the mental space of 
castration (at once imaginary and real ,  symbolic and concrete ) :  the space 
of a metaphorization whereby the image of the woman supplants the 
woman hersel f, whereby her body is fragmented, desire shattered, and 

, life explodes into a thousand pieces . Over abstract space reigns phal l ic 
'solitude and the sel f-destruction of desire. The representation of sex 
' :thus takes the place of sex itself, while the apologetic term 'sexuality' 
serves to cover up this mechanism ·of devaluation. 

Its natural status gone, its appeals for a 'cu l ture' of the body unheeded, 
s�x itself becomes no more than another localization, specificity or 
'.s{>ccialization, with i ts own particular  location and organs - 'erotogenic

zones' (as assigned by sexologists ) ,  'organs'  of reproduction, and th1 
l ike. Now neither natural nor cultural ,  sexual i ty is apparently control lec 
as a coded and decodable system a l lotted the task of mediating betwee1 
the 'real '  and the imaginary, between desi re and anxiety, between need 
and frustration .  Confined by the abstraction of a space broken dow1 
into specia l ized locations, the body itself is pulverized. The body a: 
represented by the images of advertis ing (where the legs stand fo 
stockings, the breasts for bras, the face for make-up, etc. ) serves tc 
fragment desire and doom it to anxious frustration, to the non-satisfac 
tion of local needs. In abstract space, and wherever its influence is felt 
the demise of the body has a dual  character, for i t  is at once symboli < 
and concrete : concrete, as a result  of the aggression to which the bod) 
is subject ; symbolic, on account of the fragmentation of the body'� 
living unity. Th is is especial ly true of the female body, as transformec 
into exchange value, into a sign of the commodity and indeed into < 
commodity per se. 

Typical ly, the identi fication of sex and sexual ity, of pleasure anc 
physical gratification, with ' leisure' occurs in places specia l ly designated 
for the purpose - in holiday resorts or vi l lages, on ski slopes or sun­
drenched beaches. Such leisure spaces become eroticized, as in the case 
of city neighbourhoods given over to night l i fe, to the i l lusion of festivity. 
Like play,  Eros is at once consumer and consumed. Is this done by 
means of signs ?  Yes. By means of spectacles ? Certain ly .  Abstract space 
is doubly castrating: it isolates the phal lus,  projecting it into a realm 
outside the body, then fixes it in space (vertical ity) and brings it under 
the survei l lance of the eye. The visual and the discursive are buttressed 
(or contextua l ized) in the world of signs. Is this because of what Schelsky 
cal l s  'the i ron law of commercia l  terrorism ' ?  Undoubtedly - but it is 
also, and most of a l l ,  because of the process of local ization, because of 
the fragmentation and special ization of space within a form that is 
nevertheless homogeneous overa l l .  The final stage of the body's abstrac­
tion is its ( functional )  fragmentation and local ization . 

The oddness of this space, then, is that it is at once homogeneous 
and compartmentalized. It is a lso simultaneously l impid and deceptive; 
in short, it is fraudulent. Falsely true - 'sincere' ,  so to speak; not the 
object of a fa lse consciousness, but rather the locus and medium of the 
generation (or production) of false consciousness. Appropriation, which 
in any case, even if it is concrete and effective, ought to be symbolizable 
- ought, that is, to give rise to symbols that present it, that render it 
p resent - finds itse l f  signified i n  this space, and hence rendered i l lusory. 
Once this di lemma has been acknowledged, its impl ications and conse·

quences are well-n igh inexhaustible. Abstract space contains much, but 
at the same time it masks (or denies) what it contains rather than 
indicating it .  I t  conta ins specific  imaginary elements : fantasy images, 
symbols which appear to arise from 'someth ing else' I t  contains rep­
resentations derived from the establ ished order: statuses and norms, 
local ized hierarchies and h ierarch ica l ly arranged p laces, and roles and 
values bound to particu la r  places. Such ' representations' find their auth­
ority and prescriptive power in  and through the space that underpins 
them and makes them effective .  In this space, things, acts and situations 
are forever being replaced by representations (which, inasmuch as they 
are ideological in nature, have no principle of efficiency) .  The 'world of 
signs' is not merely the space occupied by space and images (by object­
signs and sign-objects ) .  It is also that space where the Ego no longer 
relates to its own nature, to the mater ia l  world, or even to the 'thingness' 
of things (commodities ) ,  but only to things bound to their signs and 
indeed ousted and supplanted by them. The sign-bearing 'I' no longer 
deals with anything but other bearers of signs. 

This homogenizing and fractured space is broken down in h igh ly  
complex fashion into models of sectors. These models are presented as  
the product of objective analyses, described as 'systemic', which, on a 
supposedly empi rical basis, identify systems of subsystems, partial ' lo­
gics' , and so on.  To name a few at random : the transportation system; 
the urban network ; the tertia ry sector ;  the school system;  the work 
world with its attendant ( l abour) market, organizations and institutions; 
and the money market with its banking-system. Thus, step by step, 
·society in its entirety is reduced to an endless parade of systems and 
subsystems, and any social object whatsoever can pass for a coherent 
entity. Such assumptions are taken for establ i shed fact, and it is  on this 
foundation that  those who make them (ideologues, whether technocrats 
.or specialists, convinced of their own freedom from ideology) proceed 
:to build, isolating one parameter or another, one group of variables or 
another. The logical consistency and practical coherence of a particular 
·system will be asserted with no prior eva luation - even though the most 
rnrsory analysis would inevitably destroy the premise. (For example, is 
the 'urban network' exempli fied by a particu lar city ? or is it a represen­
,tation of the city in genera l ? ) The claim is that specific mechanisms are 
being identified in this way which partake of a ' real '  aspect of rea l i ty, 
- and that these mechanisms wi l l  be clearly discernible once they, and 
§pme particular facet of the ' real ' ,  have been isolated . In actual ity, a l l  
·Y'.'e have here is a tautology masquerading as science and an ideology 
masquerading as a specia l ized discip l ine. The success of a l l  such 'model-

bui lding', 's imulation' and 'systemic' ana lysis reposes upon an unstated 
postu late - that of a space underlying both the isolation of variables 
and the construction of systems. This space val idates the models in 
question precisely because the models make the space functional .  And 
this works up to a point - the point at wh ich chaos ensues.

The visual-spatial rea lm - which, as I tried to show earlier, is not to 
be confused either with geometrical space, or with optical space, or with 
the space of natural immediacy - has a vast reductive power at its 
p ractica l disposal .  Though heir to h istory and to h istory's violence, this 
rea lm is responsible for the reduction of the space of earl ier times, that 
of nature and that of history. Which means the destruction of the 
'natural '  as well as of the urban landscape. To say this is to evoke 
specific events, specific destructive decisions, and doubtless also certain 
displacements and substitutions that are more covert than events and 
decisions - and for that very reason more significant. When an urban 
squa re serving as a meeting-place isolated from traffic (e.g. the Place 
des Vosges) is transformed into an intersection (e.g. the Place de la 
Concorde) or abandoned as a place to meet (e.g. the Pa la is Roya l ) ,  city 
l i fe is subtly but profoundly changed, sacrificed to that abstract space 
where ca rs circulate l ike so many atomic particles . It has been noted 
time and again that Haussmann shattered the h istorical space of Paris 
in order to impose a space that was strategic - and hence planned and 
demarcated according to the viewpoint of strategy . The critics have 
perhaps paid insufficient attention, however, to the qual ity of the space 
Haussmann thus morta l ly  wounded, a space characterized by the high 
and rare qual i tative complexity afforded by its double network of streets 
and passageways. Is it conceivable that a complete correspondence could 
occur between a virtual ly total visualization ( i .e .  a 'visual logic' carried 
to the extreme) and a ' logic of society' in the sense of a strategy of the 
state bureaucracy? Such a concordance seems improbable - a coinci­
dence too neat to be true. Yet Oscar Niemeyer's Bras i l ia clearly fits the 
b i l l .  Nor has this fact gone unnoticed . 1 0  So faith ful ly  is technocratic and 
state-bureaucratic society projected into the space of Brasi l ia that there 
is an a lmost self-consciously comic aspect to the process.

The reduction with which we are concerned is di rected towards the 
a lready reduced dimensions of Euclidean space; as we have a l ready seen,  
this space is l i teral ly flattened out ,  confined to a surface, to a single 
plane. The steps in  this flatten ing process, at once combined and d iscon­
nected, are worth recal l ing. The person who sees and knows only how 
to see, the person who draws and knows only how to put  marks on a 
sheet of paper, the person who drives around and knows only how to 
drive a car - al l  contribute in their way to the muti lat ion of a space 
which is everywhere s l iced up.  And they a l l  complement one another: 
the driver is concerned only with steering h imself to his destination, and 
in looking about sees only what he needs to see for that purpose ; he 
thus perceives only his route, which has been materia l ized, mechanized 
and techn icized, and he sees it from one angle only - that of its 
functional i ty :  speed, readabi l i ty, faci l i ty .  Someone who knows only how 
to see ends up, moreover, seeing badly . The reading of a space that has 
been manufactured with readabi l ity in mind amounts to a sort of 
pleonasm, that of a 'pure' and i l l usory transparency. It i s  hardly surpris­
ing that one soon seems to be contemplating the product of a coherent 
activity, and, even more important, the point of emergence of a di scourse 
that is persuasive only because it is  coherent. Surely this effect of  
transparency - so pleasing, no doubt, to lovers of the logical - is in fact 
the perfect booby trap .  That, at any rate, is what I have been t rying to 
show. Space is defined in this context in terms of the perception of an  
abstract subject, such as the driver of a motor vehicle, equipped with a 
·collective common sense, namely the capacity to read the symbols of  
the highway code, and with a sole organ - the eye - placed in  the 
service of his movement within the visual field. Thus space appears 
solely in its reduced forms. Volume leaves the field to surface, and any 
overal l  view surrenders to visual s ignals spaced out a long fixed trajector­
·ies .already laid down in the 'p lan ' .  An extraordinary - indeed unthink­
able, impossible - confusion gradual ly arises between space and surface, 
with the l atter determining a spatial abstraction which it endows with 
la half-imaginary, ha lf-rea l physical existence. This abstract space eventu­
:al ly becomes the simulacrum of  a ful l  space (of that space which was 
�formerly ful l  in nature and in h istory ) .  Travel l ing - walking or strol l ing 
'about - becomes an actual ly experienced, gestural s imulation of the 
;formerly urban act ivity of encounter, of movement amongst concrete 
: existences. 
; J. So what escape can there be from a space thus shattered into images, 
:frito signs, into connected-yet-disconnected data directed at a 'subject' 
i,tself doomed to abstraction ? For space offers itself l ike a mirror to the 



3 14 CONTRA[)ICTOR Y SPACE 

thinking 'subject', but, after the manner of Lewis Carrol l ,  the 'subject ' 
p asses through the looking-glass and becomes a l ived abstraction. 

XIII 

In this same abstract space, as it is being constituted, a substitution is 
effected that  is no less sign ificant than those mentioned above: the 
replacement of residence by housing, the latter being characterized by 
its functional abstraction .  The rul ing classes seize hold of abstract space 
as it comes into being ( their political action occasions the establishment 
of abstract space, but i t  is not synonymous with it) ; and they then use 
that space as a tool of power, without for all that forgetting its other 
uses : the organization of production and of the means of production -
in a word, the generation of profit. 

The idea of residing has a poetic resonance - 'Man resides as a poet', 
says Holderl in  - yet th is cannot obscure the fact that for many centuries 
this idea had no meaning outside the aristocracy . It was solely in the 
service of 'the great' - nobles and priests - that architects bui l t  rel igious 
edifices, palaces or fortresses. The private mansion or hotel particulier, 
as developed by an a l ready decadent aristocracy, and quickly aped by 
the bourgeoisie (of the 'h igh' variety, of course ) ,  cal ls for formal rooms 
sumptuously appointed but at the same time well set back from public 
thoroughfares - from streets, squares or boulevards. These rooms give 
onto a main courtyard. The aristocrat is concerned neither with seeing 
nor with being seen - save on ceremonial occasions. He ' is '  per se. The 
essence of a palace or mansion thus l ies in  its interior disposition. Its 
luxury retains something organic, something natural , whence i ts charm. 
The fa\ade is strictly secondary and derivative. Often it is lacking 
a l together, i ts role usurped by the severity of a monumental porch or 
formal carriage entrance leading to the courtyard. With in, the household 
goes about its business: the lord is amidst his dependants - wife, 
chi ldren, rel ations at various removes ; and these in turn are surrounded 
by their servants .  There is no privacy here: the word has no meaning. 
Both privacy and the fa\ade wil l  come only with the advent of the 
bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisification of the nobi l i ty .  Sti l l ,  'common' 
areas, stables or kitchens, are clearly distinct from the spaces occupied 
by the masters, whose pride, arrogance, needs and desires are deployed 
in pl aces set aside for the purpose. 

The bourgeois apartment is no doubt a parody of the aristocratic 
mansion, yet beyond this imitative aspect a quite di fferent way of 



CONTRAD I CTO R Y  SPACE 3 1 5  
occupying space i s  t o  b e  discerned. The formal rooms - drawing-room, 
dining-room, smoking-room, bi l l iard room - are lavish in their size, 
decoration and furnishings. Their disposition is qu i te different from that 
of the aristocratic residence, for doors, windows and balconies open 
these rooms to the street. The visible and the visual are a l ready in 
command. The fac;ade, designed both to be looked at and to provide a 
point of vantage, is organ ized, with its sculptures, balustrades and 
mouldings, around balconies. The street's cont inu ity, meanwhile ,  is 
founded upon the a l ignment of juxtaposed fac;ades. Though its function 
is now reduced to transit a lone, the street retains a great importance. 
In designing a fac;ade and its ornamentation, the architect helps an imate 
the street and contributes to the creation of urban space. A perspectivist 
rational i ty st i l l  governs the ordering of streets and avenues, squares and 
parks. Though there is  no longer much of the organic left, space has 
nevertheless preserved a certain unity. The bourgeois apartment bui lding 
is not yet a mere box . As  for the bodi ly ' functions' of eating and drinking, 
sleeping and making love, these are thrust out of sight. Adjudged strictly 
crude and vulgar, they are relegated to the rear of the house, to kitchens, 
bathrooms, water closets and bedrooms often to be found along or at 
the end of dark corridors or over small, i l l - l it courtyards. In short, in 
the outside-inside relationship, i t  is  the ou.tside that predominates. Eros 
disappears, in paradoxical fashion, into th is two-tiered interior of recep­
tion rooms and private rooms. A psychoanalysis of space would show 
that bourgeois space impl ies a fi l tering of the erotic, a repression of 
libidines that is at  once caesura and censure. The servants or domestic 
staff, for their pan, live under the eaves. In the inhabited space a 
1moralizing solemnity is the order of the day (something unknown to 
·ithe aristocracy) ,  an atmosphere of family and conjugal l i fe - in short, 
of genitality - all of which is nobly dubbed an intimite. If the outside 
dominates the inside-outside relationship, this is because the outside is 
\the only thing that real ly matters : what one sees and what is seen . 
. . .  _Nevertheless, the interior, where Eros dies, is also invested with value 
·;::;: a lbeit in a mystifying and mystified way. Heavy curtains a l low inside 
.·tp be isolated from outside, the balcony to be separated from the 
�<:Jrawing-room, and hence for ' int imacy' to be preserved and signified. 
<?ccasionally a curtain i s  drawn, and light bathes the fac;ade: festivity is  
! thus announced. In another sphere (or perhaps better :  for the benefit of 
1arpther sphere), this picture is  completed by the addition of things called 
cdfJjets d'art; sometimes these are painted or sculpted nudes which add 
;the cachet of a touch of nature or of l ibertinage - in order, precisely, 
'h�jkcep al l  such ideas at arm's length .

The l ived experience of space is not divorced from theory. Clearly i t  

would be trite indeed to stress everyday l ived experience only to elevate 
i t  immediately to the level of theory . Describing the ill effects wreaked 
by the advent of l i fts, which al lowed the wel l - to-do to monopolize the 
upper storeys of bui ldings while at the same time avoiding the encounters 
to which the use of sta i rways and landings had formerly obliged them, 
does not get us very far. Theory does not have to place l ived experience 
in brackets in order to promote its concepts, however. On the contrary, 
l ived experience partakes of the theoretical sphere, and th is means that 
the divis ion between conceptualization and l i fe ( though not the need to 
draw distinctions and exercise discernment) i s  artificia l .  The analysis of 
bourgeoisified space val idates the theory of abstract space. What is 
more, inasmuch as this theory unifies the l ived and the conceptual ized 
i t  exposes the content of abstraction while at the same time reuniting 
the sensory and the theoretical realms.  If the senses themselves become 
theoreticians, theory wil l  indeed revea l the meaning of the sensory realm. 

For the working class, as is well known, the primary product of 
capital ism in its 'ascendant' phase - the capital ism of the belle epoque, 
with its competitiveness, its princely rate of profit, and its bl ind but 
rapid accumulation - was slums at the edge of the city . This trend 
quickly destroyed the space of tradit ional residential  bui ldings, where 
bourgeois lived on the lower floors, and workers and servants in the 
garrets. The one-room s lum dwel l ing that had once been found, typically, 
at the end of a dark passageway, in a back courtyard or perhaps even 
in  a cel lar, was thus banished to peripheral neighbourhoods or suburbs. 
If this was a belle epoque, i t belonged to the bourgeois ie .  

I t  was at  this j uncture that the idea of housing began to take on 
definit ion, along with its corol laries: minimal l iv ing-space, as quantified 
in terms of modular units and speed of access; l ikewise minimal facil ities 
and a p rogrammed environment. What was actual ly being defined here, 
by dint of successive approximations, was the lowest possible threshold 
of tolerability. Later, in the present century, s lums began to disappear. 
In suburban space, however, detached houses contrasted with 'housing 
estates' j ust as sharply as the earl ier opulent apartments with the garrets 
of the poor above them . The idea of the 'bare minimum' was no less in 
evidence. Suburban houses and 'new towns' came close to the lowest 
possible threshold of sociability - the point beyond which survival would 
be impossible because al l  socia l  l i fe would have disappeared. Internal and ·: : 
invis ible boundaries began to divide a space that nevertheless remained in , ,. 
thral l  to a globa l strategy and a single power. These boundaries did not( 
merely separate levels - loca l ,  regional ,  national and worldwide. Ther 



CONTR ADICTORY SPACE 3 1 7  

also separated zones where people were supposed to be reduced to thei r 
'simplest expression ' ,  to their ' lowest common denominator' , from zones 
where people could spread out in comfort and enjoy those essential 
luxuries, time and space, to the fu l l .  As a matter of fact 'boundaries' is 
coo weak a word here, and it obscures the essential point; it would be 
more accurate to speak of fracture l ines reveal i ng the true - invis ible 
yet highly i rregular  - contours of ' real '  socia l  space lying beneath its 
homogeneous surface. 

This real i ty is concealed by the widely promoted image of a h ierarchy 
of levels, a neat ordering of variables and dimensions. A logical impl i ­
cation, a purely formal conj unction/disjunction, is  thus substituted for 
the concrete relationship between homogeneous and broken up.  Space 
is spoken of as though it were able, in a more or less harmonious 
fashion, to 'organize' i ts own component factors : modular units and 
plans, the composition and density of  occupation, morphological (or 
formal) versus functional elements, urbanistic and architectural features, 
and so on. The dominant discourse on space - describing what is seen 
by eyes affected by far more serious congenita l  defects than myopia or 
astigmatism - robs rea l ity of  mean ing by dressing i t  in an ideological 
garb that does not appear as such, but instead gives the impression o f  
being non-ideological ( o r  else 'beyond ideology ' ) .  These vestments, to 
be more specific, are those of aesthetics and aestheticism, of rationa l i ty 
and rational ism. 

A classical (Cartes ian)  rational i ty thus appears to underpin various 
spatial distinctions and divisions. Zoning, for example, wh ich is respon­
sible - precisely - for fragmentation, break-up and separation under the 
:umbrella of a bureaucratical ly  decreed unity, i s  conflated with the 
.rational capacity to discrim inate .  The assignment of functions, and 
the way functions are actua l ly distributed 'on the ground', becomes 
indistinguishable from the kind of analytical activity that discerns d i ffer­
ences. What is being covered up here is a moral and polit ical order : the 
· �pccific power that organizes these conditions, with i ts specific socio­
'�conomic al legiance, seems to flow d irectly from the Logos - that is, 
.:from a 'consensual '  embrace of  the rationa l .  Classical reason has appar­
'chtly undergone a convulsive degeneration into technologica l and tech ­
""riocratic rational ity; this is the moment of its transformation into its 
·9pposite - into the absurdity of a pulverized real ity. I t  is 'on the ground' 
"too that the state-bureaucratic order, i tsel f a cloak for state capital ism 
(�xcept when it is  a c loak for state socia l ism) ,  s imultaneously achieves 
:�el��actual ization and self-concea lment, fuzzy ing its image in  the crystal ­
,'.�le'ar a i r  of functional and  structural readabil ity. The unity of reason 



3 1 8  CONTRADICTO R Y  SPACF. 
(or of raison d'etat) is thus draped effectively over the plethora of 
juxtaposed and superimposed administrative divisions, each of which 
corresponds to a particular 'operation ' 

Abstract space is thus repressive in essence and par excellence - but 
thanks to its versati l ity i t  is repressive in a pecul iar ly artful  way: i ts 
intr insic repressiveness may be manifested a l ternately through reduction, 
th rough ( functiona l )  loca l ization, through the imposition of h ierarchy 
and segregation - or th rough art. The fact of viewing from afar, of 
contemplating what has been torn apart, of arranging 'viewpoints '  and 
'perspectives' , can ( in the most favourable cases) change the effects of 
a strategy into aesthetic objects . Such art objects, though generally 
abstract, which is to say non-figurative, nevertheless play a figurative 
role in that they are truly admirable representations of a 'su rrounding' 
space that effectively k i l l s  the surroundings. Al l  of th is  corresponds only 
too wel l  to that urbanism of maquettes and overal l  plans which is the 
perfect complement to the planning of sewers and public works : the 
creator's gaze l ights at wil l  and to his heart's content on 'volumes' ; but 
this is  a fake l ucidity, one wh ich misapprehends both the social practice 
of the 'users' and the ideology that it itself enshrines. None of which 
prevents it in the sl ightest degree from presiding over the spectacle, and 
forging the un i ty into which a l l  the programmed fragments must be 
integrated, no matter what the cost. 

XIV 

The breaking-up of space gives rise to conflict when two disconnected 
contents, each from its own angle of approach, tend towards a single 
form (organization ) .  Take, for example, a company and its space. A 
company is often surrounded by an agglomeration that serves it, and to 
wh ich it has given rise: a min ing vi l lage or company town. In such cases 
the community comes under the absolute rule of the company, i.e. the 
rule of the company's (capita l ist) owners. Employees tend to lose their 
status as free workers (or 'proletarians' in Marx's sense), retaining 
maste ry over whatever time they do not give up in the form of labour 
time to the capital ist - who buys labour power, but not the worker as 
a physical being and a human individual .  To the extent that capitalist 
enterprises create enclaves of complete dependence and subjection of 
workers, these remain isolated even with in the space where the ' freedom' 
of the individual ,  and that of (commercia l  and industri a l )  capital itself, 
hold sway. But to the extent that these enclaves tend to l ink up, they 



CONTRA D I CTO R Y  SPACE 3 1 9 

constitute a fabric well suited to the emergence of a total i tari an capi­
talism ( founded on the fusion of the economic and the polit ica l ) .  

Big-city space is in no way  analogous to  the  space of  a company town 
_ and i t  is for this reason that a city cannot be run on such a model ,  
no matter how big a company one envisages. Workers in the c ity are 
as a rule ' free' workers ( re lat ively speaking, of cou rse, and a lways 
bearing in mind the abstractly phi losoph ical meaning of ' freedom' ) .  Th is 
is what makes it possible for urban workers to l ive side by side with 
other social classes. The social division of labour predominates over its 
technical division . Otherwise, the city would not a l low the reproduction 
of labour power or the reproduction of production relations, nor wou ld 
i t  a l low the access of a l l  to the var ious markets (and first and foremost 
to the market for consumer goods) . And these are among the city's 
essential functions. 

In other words, liberty engenders contradictions which are also spatial 
contradictions. Whereas businesses tend towards a tota l itarian form of 
social organ ization, authoritarian and prone to fascism, u rban con­
ditions, either despite or by virtue of violence, tend to uphold at  least 
a measure of democracy.

The meanings conveyed by abstract space are more often prohibitions 
than solicitations or stimul i  (except when it comes to consumption ) .  
Prohibition - the negative basis, so  to  speak, of  the socia l  order - i s  
what dominates here. The symbol of  this constitutive repression i s  an  
object offered up to  the gaze yet barred from any  possible use, whether 
this occurs in a museum or in a shop window. I t  is impossible to say 
how often one pauses uncomfortably for a moment on some threshold 
'-' ' the entrance of a church, office or 'publ ic' building, or the point of 
access to a ' foreign' place - while passively, and usua l ly 'unconsciously' , 
accepting a prohibi tion of some kind. Most such prohibitions are invis­
iole. Gates and rail ings, ditches and other material barriers a re merely

signs and signifiers protect the spaces of  el ites - rich neighbourhoods

subdivided into spaces for work and spaces for leisure, and into daytime

are dedicated to that function, but which by the same token possess 
noth ing aside from the accoutrements of entertainment, the infrastruc­
ture of this pecul iarly  soph isticated form of exploitation . In these neigh­

every righ t; in actua l ity, the only right it has is to be deployed in

How does this space, which we have described as at once homogeneous 
and broken up, maintain itse lf  in view of the formal irreconcilabi l ity of 
these two characteristics ? How can two such properties, ' incompatible' 
from a logical point of view, be said to enter into association with one 
another and constitute a 'whole' which not only does not disintegrate 
but even aids in the deployment of strategies ? 

We have already posed this question, though in a sl ightly different 
form, and also suggested an answer. We must come back to this issue, 
however. The solution is not to be found in space as such - as a thing 
or set of things, as facts or a sequence of facts, or as 'medium' or 
'environment' .  To pursue any such l ine of investigation is  to return to 
the thesis of a space that is neutra l ,  that  is prior or external to social 
practice and hence on those grounds mental or fetish ized (objectified). 
Only an act can hold - and hold together - such fragments in a . 
homogeneous tota lity. Only action can prevent d ispersion, l ike a fist ·� 
clenched around sand. 

Pol it ical power and the pol it ical action of that power's administrative 
. apparatus cannot be conceived of either as 'substances' or as 'pure ,· 

forms' . This power and this action do make use of rea l ities and forms, 
however. The i l l usory clar ity of space is  in the last analysis the i l lusory� . 



CONTl{ A D I CTOR Y SPACE 321  

clarity of a power that may  be  glimpsed in the rea l iry that i t  governs, 
but which at the same time uses that rea l i ty as a vei l .  Such is the action 
of pol it ical power, which creates fragmentation and so controls i t  -
which creates it, i ndeed, in order to control it .  But fragmented rea l iry 
(dispersion,  segregation, separation, local izat ion) may on occasion over­
whelm polit ical power, which for its part depends for sustenance on 
continual rein forcement .  This vicious circle accounts for the ever more 
severe character of political authority, wherever exercised, for i t  gives 
rise to the sequence force-repression-oppression. This is the form under 
which state-polit ical power becomes omnipresent :  it  is  everywhere, but 
its presence varies in intensity ; i n  some places it is d i ffuse, in others 
concentrated . In th is respect it resembles divine power in religions and 
theologies. Space is what makes i t  possible for the economic to be 
integrated into the polit ica l .  'Focused ' zones exert influences in all 
directions, and these influences may be 'cultura l ' ,  ideological, or  of some 
other kind. It is not political power per se that produces space; it does 
reproduce space, however, inasmuch as it is  the locus and context of 
the reproduction of socia l  relationships - relationships for which it is 
responsible . 

XVII 

The time has come to clar ify the aims of the present discussion in terms 
of Marx and his thought - in terms, a lso, of political economy as 
science, and of the cri tique of polit ical economy as ideology. 

The best way to get Marx's th inking into perspective is to reconstitute 
it,<,to restore in its entirety, and to look upon it not as an end point or 

:c.onclusion but rather as a point of departure. In  other words, Marxism 
should be treated as one moment in  the development of theory, and 
not, dogmatica l ly,  as a definitive theory. The fact is - and there is no 

::' feason not to repeat it here - that two errors or i l l usions have to be 
avoided in this connection. The first looks upon Marx's thought as a 
:system, endeavours to integrate it into the body of established know­
: I.edge, and hence tries to apply epistemological criteria to it .  The second 
s.ecks by contrast to demolish Marx ist thought in the name of a radical t_ri.tique, in  the name of bringing criticism to bear on the very tools of 
criticism. Those who take the first approach are seduced by the idea of 
absolute knowledge, and accept the thesis, which is h istorical ly  a Hegel-
ii.1_1. ;one, that such a knowledge exists and can be appl ied to a ' rea l i ty '  
tt�,elf already establ ished. Partisans of the second view, meanwhile, fa l l

under the spell of destruction and sel f-destruction, and become con­
vinced that ' rea l i ty' can be destroyed by undermining the foundations 
of  knowledge. Surely we should instead view Marxism today much as 
the theory of relat ivity views Newtonian physics - as a moment in the 
progress of thought, not only in the sense of a stage in that thought's 
h istorical genesis, to be recal led for pedagogical purposes, but also in 
the sense of a moment that is necessary because sti l l  immanent and 
essentia l ,  and indeed sti l l  evolving. In  this way, the question of the 
political discontinuity or rift between the theory of the state (Hegel )  and 
the radical critique of the state (Marx)  is left open . 

It is possible today to reconstruct the trajectory of political economy, 
i ts rise and fal l ,  including the pinnacle it reached in the work of Marx. 
Th is brief and dramatic history cannot be detached from so-called 
economic 'real ity' - thac is, from the growth of the forces of production 
(the primi tive accumulation of  capital ) .  The decline of economic thought 
began with the d i fficulties encountered by growth and by the ideology 
that j ustified and stimulated it - with the polit ical empiricism and 
pragmatism of the solutions proposed to the p roblems associated with 
growth.  

Before considering this history, i t  wi l l  be well to review a few concepts 
- that of social labour, for example, as first proposed by the great 
English pol itical economists and later e laborated upon by others, notably 
Hegel and Marx. Socia l  l abour had an eventful career. Both real ity and 
concept emerged a long with the bi rth of modern industry, and both 
successfu l ly  imposed themselves, despite countervai l ing efforts and con­
tingencies, to the point where they became crucia l ,  in theory as in 
practice, for science and for society. Productive ( industria l )  labour, as 
rea lity, as concept and as ideology, gave rise to moral and artistic 
'val ues ' ,  and hence production and productivity became not merely 
social motors but also the rational basis of a conception of the world 
l inked to the philosophy of h istory and to the rising science of political 
economy. But soon obsolescence set in. Values and concepts derived 
from labour began to wear out. And as a theory of growth and a 
generator of models political economy disintegrated. , 

Something comparable had happened around the middle of the nine-1 ,·: 
teenth century, but at that time Marx had given political economy a·-: ·  
new lease on l i fe in a way both unforeseen and incomprehensible to the- ' ·  
economic pundits of the t ime.  S imply stated, Marx supplied poli tica l'.': 
economy with its own self-criticism as part of a global approach (to� . ,  
time, to h istory, and to socia l  practice ) .  This schema is well known 
today - even too well known, for its creative capacity (some would 



CONTR A D I CTO R Y SPACE 323 
say i ts 'productive' capacity - and why not ? )  has been prejudiced in 
consequence. A creative capacity of this kind manifests i tse l f  between 
the time when a concept begins to perturb dominant tendencies and the 
time when it begins to promote these tendencies - when, in other words, 
it is incorporated into the established wisdom, i nto the publ ic domain,  
into culture and pedagogy. Marx and Marxism have certa in ly not 
escaped a process of this kind, but the Marxist schema has retained 
much force . There is no knowledge, according to this schema, without 
a critique of knowledge - no knowledge aside from crit ical knowledge. 
Political economy as a science is not and cannot be 'positive' and 
'positive' alone; political economy is a lso the cri tique of polit ical econ­
omy - that is  to say, the critique of the economic and of the pol i tical , 
and of their supposed uni ty or synthesis. An understanding of production 
implies its critical analysis, and th is brings the concept of re lations of 
production out of obscurity. These relations, once clearly identified, 
exert a retroactive influence upon the confused ensemble from which 
they have emerged - upon the concepts of productive socia l  labour and 
of production. At this point a new concept is constituted, one which 
subsumes that  of the relations of production but is not identical to i t :  
the concept of mode of production. Between the relations of production 
and the mode of production is a connection that Marx never completely 
uncovered, never fu l ly worked out. This created a lacuna in his thought 
that his successors have striven to fill. Whether they have succeeded in 
doing so is another matter. 

What of the part played by the land, as concept and as real i ty ,  in  this 
· context ? At the outset, for the physiocrats, the land was a determining 
factor, but subsequently it seemed fated quickly to lose al l  importance. 
Agriculture and agricu l tural labour were expected to fade away in  face 
·.oUndustrial labour, as much from the quantitative point of view (wealth 
·,produced) as from the qual i tative one ( needs met by products of  the 
Jand) ; agriculture itse lf, it was felt, could and should be industria l ized. 
::fiurthermore, the land belonged to a class - aristocracy, landowners or 
..fe.udal lords - which the bourgeoisie appeared certain either to abolish 
·qr. else to subjugate into complete insignificance. Lastly, the town would 
'.su rely come to dominate the country, and this would be the death knel l  
(?r the transcendence) of the whole antagonism. 
· \Jhe political  economists wavered a good deal on the issues of land, 

'qf; labour and agricultural products, of property and ground rent, and 
9f :nature, and their hesitations may easi ly be traced - including, nat­
li[�lly, those of Malthus as well as those of Ricardo and Marx. 
i.'<Marx's initia l i ntention in  Capital was to analyse and lay bare the 



324 C O N T R A D I CT O R Y  SPACE 

capita l ist mode of production and bourgeois society in  terms of a binary 
(and dia lectica l )  model that opposed capital to labour, the bourgeoisie 
to the proletariat, and also, impl icitly, profits to wages. This polarity 
may make i t  possible to grasp the conflictual development invol ved in 
a formal manner, and so to articulate it intel l igibly, but it presupposes 
the disappearance from the picture of a third cluscer of factors : namely 
the land, che landowning class, ground rent and agricu lture as such . 
More genera l ly speaking, chis bringing co che fore of a binary opposicion 
of a confl ictua l  (dia lectical )  character impl ies the subordination of the 
historical to the economic, both in rea lity and in the conceptual rea lm, 
and hence too the dissolving or absorption, by the economic sphere 
proper, of a multipl ici ty of formations ( the town, among others) 
inherited from h istory, and themselves of a precapitalist nature. In the 
context of this schema the space of social practice is imperceptible; time 
has but a very smal l  part to play;  and che schema itsel f is located in an 
abstract mental space. Time is reduced co the measure of socia l labour. 

Marx quickly became aware - as he was bound to do - of resistance 
to this reductive schema ( though many 'Marxists' - and a l l  dogmatic 
Marxists without exception - have retained it, and indeed aggravated 
its problems instead of correccing for them) .  1 1 Such resistance came 
from several sides, and in the first place from the very rea l i ty under 
consideration - namely, the Earth . On a world scale, landed property 
showed no signs of disappearing, nor did the pol itical importance of 
landowners, nor did the characteristics pecul iar  to agricultura l  pro­
duccion. Nor, consequently, did ground rent suddenly abandon the field 
to profits and wages. What was more, questions of underground and 
above-ground resources - of  the space of the entire planet - were 
continual ly growing in importance.  

Such considerations account, no doubt,  for the pecul iarities of a 'plan' 
that is exceedingly hard to reconstruct - that of Capital. At the close 
of Marx's work, the issue of the land and its ownership re-emerges, and 
this in a most emphatic way, complete with consideration of ownership 
in the cases of underground resources, of mines, minerals, waters and 
forests, as well as in those of the breeding of l ivestock, of construction 
and of bui l t-up land. Lastly ,  and most significantly, Marx now proposed 

1 1  The fate of Marxism has meant - and who by this time could st i l l be unaware of it? 
- that all dispute, discussion or d ia logue concern ing the crucia l areas of the theory has 
been prevented . For instance, any attempt to restore to its proper place the concept oC 
ground rent has for decades been utterly squelched, whether in France, in Europe or in  
the world at large, in the name of a Marxism that has become mere ideology - nothing .  
but a pol itica l tool in the hands of apparatchiks.

his ' tr inity formula ' ,  according to which there were three, not rwo, 
elements in  the capital ist mode of production and in  bourgeois society. 
These three aspects or 'factors' were the Earth (Madame la  Terre) ,  
capital (Monsieur le Capita l ) ,  and  l abour (the Workers ) .  In  other words : 
rent, profit, wages - three factors whose interrelationships sti l l  needed 
to be identified and clearly set forth . 1 2 And three, I repeat, rather than 
two : the earl ier binary opposit ion (wages versus capital , bourgeoisie 
versus working class) , had been adandoned. In  speaking of the earth, 
Marx did not simply mean agricu lture .  Underground resources were 
also part of  the picture .  So too was the nation state, confined within a 
specific territory. And hence u l timately, in the most absolute sense, 
pol itics and polit ical strategy. 

Capital, which was never completed, comes to a halt at this point. 
We are now beginning to understand the reasons why Marx fai led to 
bring his work to a conclusion - a fa i lure for which his i l l  health was 
only partly responsible .  

What excuse could there be today for not going back to th i s  exemplary 
if unfinished work - not with a view to consecrating it in any way but 
in order to put questions to i t ?  This  i s  especia l ly needful at a t ime when 
capitalism, and more genera lly development, have demonstrated that 
their survival depends on their being able to extend their reach to space 
in its enti rety : to the land ( in the process absorbing the towns and 
agriculture, an outcome a lready foreseeable in  the n ineteenth century, 
but also, and less predi ctably, creating new sectors a l together - notably 
that of leisure ) ;  to the underground resources lying deep in the ea rth 
and beneath the sea-bed - energy, raw materials, and so on ; and lastly 
to 'What might be cal led the above-ground sphere, i .e. to volumes or 
constructions considered in terms of their height, to the space of moun­
tains and even of the planets. Space in the sense of  the earth, the 
ground, has not disappeared, nor has i t  been incorporated into industrial 
production ; on the contrary, once integrated into capital ism, it only 
gains in strength as a specific element or function in capital ism's expan­
- sion. This expansion has been an  active one, a forward leap of the forces

its imprint upon the total occupation of all pre-existing space and upon 
the production of a new space. Not only has capital ism la id hold of 
pre-existing space, of the Ea rth , but it a l so tends to p roduce a space of 
its own. How can this be ? The answer i s :  th rough and by means of 
u rbanization, under the pressure of the world market; and, in accordance 
with the law of the reproducible and the repeti tive, by abolishing spatial 
and temporal di fferences, by destroying nature and nature's t ime. Is 
there not a danger that  the economic sphere, fetish ized as the world 
market, along with the space that it determines, and the pol itical sphere 
made absolute,  might destroy their own foundation - namely land, 
space, town and country - and thus in effect sel f-destruct? 

Some of the new contradictions generated by the extension of capi­
tal ism to space have given rise to qu ickly popularized representations. 
These divert and evade the problems involved ( i . e .  the problematic of 
space), and in fact serve to mask the contradictions that have brought 
them into being. The issue of pol lution is a case in point. Pol lution has 
a lways existed, in  that human groups, settled in v i l l ages or towns, have 
a lways discharged wastes and refuse into their natural surroundings; 
but the symbiosis - in the sense of exchange of energies and materia ls 
- between nature and society has recently undergone modification, 
doubtless to the point of rupture .  Th is is what a word such as 'pol lution' 
at once acknowledges and conceals by metaphorizing such ordinary 
things as household rubbish and smoking chimneys. In the case of 'the 
environment', we are confronted by a typical ly metonymic manoeuvre, 
for the term takes us from the part - a fragment of space more or less 
ful ly  occupied by objects and signs, functions and structures - to the 
whole, which is empty, and defined as a neutra l and passive 'medium' . 
I f  we ask, 'whose environment? '  or 'the environment of what?' ,  no 
pertinent answer is forthcoming. 

Although these points have been made earl ier, i t  seems important that 
they be reiterated. The reason is that in many quarters truly  magical 
origins and powers continue to be attributed to ideologies. How, for 
example, could bourgeois ideology, if it were no more than a mirror­
l ike reflection of real i ty, actual ly reproduce th is rea l i ty and its production 
relations ? By masking contradictions ? It certain ly does do that, but it 
a lso brings nations and national isms into being - hardly a specula� 
effect. There is no need to evoke h istory ( the genesis of the nation 
states) ,  however: any close examination of what such pseudo-theory 
purports to expla in wil l  suffice to demonstrate its absurdity. In Marx's . 
trinitarian scheme, by contrast, there is no r i ft between ideology and ' 
polit ical practice : power holds earth, labour and capital together and

reproduces them (whether in conjunction or dis junction ) separately .  
In Marx, the critique of political economy had an import and meaning 

that a latter-day productivist approach would overlook completely. It 
was the actual concept of pol itical economy, as a form of knowledge, 
that Marx had in his sights. He showed that, in promoting and practising 
a science that claimed to understand p roduction and productive forces, 
the economists mystified both their readers and themselves. What they 
were describing were the conditions of scarcity and pal l iatives to that 
scarcity .  Directly or indirectly, cynically or hypocritical ly ,  they preached 
asceticism. Well before the sixteenth century, perhaps in the depths of 
the Middle Ages, perhaps even earlier, a t  the time of Rome's decl ine 
and of early Judaeo-Christianity, Western society chose to accumulate 
rather than to l ive, so opening a chasm, creating a contradiction between 
enjoying and economizing whose drama would thereafter hold society 
in an iron grip. Centuries a fter this basic choice had been taken some­
where back in the mists of time, political economy arose as a rationale 
for it . Its birth as a science coincided with the triumph of economics in 
the sphere of socia l  practice - the triumph, in  other words, of the 
concern with accumulation by means of and for the sake of  profit, an 
accumula tion that was forever expanding. 

So just who were the economists, i n  Marx's view ? They were the 
voices of ( relative) want, of the transition from archaic scarcities to a 
now-conceivable abundance .  They made a study of ( relative) scarcities 
and contributed to an  unjust distribution of 'goods' .  Their  pseudo­
science, which was, as such, ideological i n  character, embodied and 
masked a practice. The economists were acquainted with scarcity per 
se; they were not so much the expression of  that scarcity as the concrete 
consciousness - albeit poorly developed - of the insufficiencies of  pro­
duction. This was the sense that pol i tical economy had for Marx. Or 
perhaps better :  i t  is in this sense that (pol it ica l )  economy was polit ica l .  
It enabled the henchmen of  the state, political power, to organize the 
apportionment of  want. The concrete relations of p roduction could 
thus give r ise to distribution and to consumption. The 'distr ibution' in 
question was carried out under the masks of l iberty and equal i ty, even 
under those of fraterni ty and j ustice. The law's function was to codify 
Jhe rules. 'Summum j us, summa injur ia . '  

Law and j ustice presided over in justice, and the name of equality was 
applied to an inequal i ty that became no less flagrant as a result  - though 

;it did become harder to combat. 

. .  Whether deliberately or not, consciously or not, the economists put Ihe finishing touches to the results of the law of value ( results produced 



328 CONTRADICTO R Y  S PACE 
in a b l ind and spontaneous manner) ,  for they effected the a l location, 
within (nationa l )  spatial frameworks, and according to the needs of 
industry's various branches, of the labour power and productive capacity 
avai lable to a given society (Britain or France, for instance) under the 
capital ist mode of p roduction and under the state that had control over 
that p roduction . To this end the economists constructed an abstract 
space or abstract spaces in which to place and promote their models of 
'harmonious development' The methodology of a Bastiat, in  Marx's 
time, was not much cruder than this. The economists never succeeded 
in getting out of mental space, the space of their models, into social 
space. The management of society, to wh ich for a long time they 
contributed not a l i ttle, thus proceeded a long the road of development 
(expanded accumulation ) ,  but it did so under the control of the bour­
geoisie ;  the bourgeois relations of production were reta ined in their 
essent ia ls ;  and, most importantly, the negative aspects of the situation 
were made to appear positive and constructive. 

During the period of the economists' ascendancy, the ' benefits of 
na tu re' and the 'elements' (water, air, l ight, space) received mention, if 
at al l ,  only for the purpose of excluding them from the domain of 
polit ical economy: on account of their abundance they had no exchange 
value;  their 'use' embodied no value; they were the outcome of no social 
labour;  and no one produced them. 

What has occurred in this connection in more recent times ? And what 
is the situation today ? Certain goods that were once scarce have become 
( relatively) abundant, and vice versa. As a resul t  use val ue, so long 
overshadowed by exchange value, has been relocated and, as it were, 
reinvested with value. Bread has lost the symbolic force it formerly had 
in Europe, where it once stood for food in general ,  for everything 
p recious, and even for labour itsel f ( 'Give us this day our dai ly bread' ;  
' In  the sweat of  thy face shalt  thou eat bread' ) .  In the advanced countries, 
where agricu lture has been industria l ized, a permanent overproduction, 
whether overt or covert, has long been the order of the day, complete 
with the stocking of surplus grain and restraints, often subsidized, on 
the exploitation of productive land. Not that this has had the slightest 
impact on the suffering of mi l l ions - indeed, hundreds of mi l l ions - of 
human beings in the so-cal led underdeveloped nations, who are prey to 
malnutrition if not outright famine. Much the same sort of thing may 
be said of a host of objects of everyday uti l i ty in the major industrialized 
countries. Nobody today is unaware of the fact that the obsolescence

. of such p roducts is p lanned, that waste has an economic function, or ' 
that fashion plays an enormous role, as does 'cul ture', in a functional ized

consumption that i s  structured accordingly .  These developments spelt 
the doom of political economy, and i ts place has been usurped by 
market research, sales techn iques, advertising, the manipulation of needs, 
investment-plan ning gu ided by consulting-fi rms, and so forth . Manipu­
lation of this kind, a practice only too compatible with polit ical propa­
ganda, has no more need of 'science' than i t  has of ideology ; it calls for 
information rather than knowledge. 

Thanks to a dialectica l process, the ( relative) abundance of  industrfal 

products in today's so-ca l led consumer society is accompanied by an 
inverse phenomenon : new scarcities. Th is dia lectic itse lf  has been the 
subject of hardly any analysis or explanation, for its operation is con­
cealed by the continual  d iscussion of pol lution, threats to the 'environ­
ment', ecosystems, the destruction of natu re, the using-up of resources, 
and so forth. Such entities serve only as ideological shields. Meanwhile, 
the ever-increasing 'new scarcities' are l iable to precipitate a crisis (or 
crises ) of a type without precedent. Those commodities which were 
formerly abundant because they occurred 'natural ly ' ,  which had no 
value because they were not products, have now become rare, and so 
acquired value. They have now to be produced, and consequently they 
come to have not only a use value but also an exchange value. Such 
commodities are 'elementa l '  - not least in the sense that they are indeed 
'elements' .  In the most modern urban planning, using the most highly 
perfected technological applications, everything is produced : a ir, l ight, 
water - even the land itse lf. Everything is factitious and 'sophisticated' ;  
nature has disappeared al together, save for a few signs and  symbols -
and even in them nature is merely 'reproduced' Urban space is detached 
from natural space, but it re-creates its own space on the basis of 
productive capacity. Natural space, at least under certain  socio-economic 
conditions, becomes a scarce commodity. Inversely, scarcity becomes 
spatial - and local .  Everything thus affected by scarcity has a close 
relationship to the Earth : the resources of the land, those beneath the 
earth (petroleum) and those above it (a ir, l ight, volumes of space, etc. ) ,  
along �i th things which depen� on these reso�rces, such as vegetab� 
and animal products and energies of various kinds. �-

The 'elements' lose their natural determinations, including their siting 
and situation, as they are incorporated into the 'space envelopes' which 
�re fast becoming the social bui lding-blocks of space. They assume value 

.--'= .both use value and exchange value - because it is no longer possible 
· to�draw them directly from an everlasting source, namely nature. The 
�emands made by current developments such as these are surely just as 
iinportam as the potential exhaustion - still on the distant horizon - of 



330 CONTRADICTORY SPACE 

industrial (e.g. minera l )  resources . In the traditional industrial pro­
duction process, the relationship to space had long been comprised of 
discrete points : the p lace of extraction or origin of raw materials, the 
place of production ( factory) ,  and the place of  sale. Only the distribution 
networks of this system had a wider spatial dimension .  Now that 
the 'elements' themselves are produced and reproduced, however, the 
relationship of productive activ ity to space is modified ; it involved space 
now in another way, and this is as true for the i nitial stages of the 
p rocess ( for example, the management of water and water resources) as 
it is for the final stages (with in urban space) and for a l l  the steps in 
between. 

The finiteness of nature and of the Earth thus has the power to 
chal lenge bl ind ( ideologica l )  bel ief in the infinite power of abstraction, 
of human thinking and technology, and of political power and the space 
which that  power generates and decrees . 

Once the 'elements' begin to circu late within systems of production, 
a l location or distribution, they necessari ly become part of wealth in 
general ,  and so fa l l  within  the purview of pol itical economy. But is this 
pol itical economy sti l l  classical political economy? The new shortages 
are not comparable to the scarcities of earl ier times, for the notable 
reason that the relationship to space has changed. They are located, 
more and more firmly, within space as a whole, within that space into 
which the old industrial production was inserted, with its discrete points, 
and which was subsequently completely occupied by expanding capi­
tal ism and by the reproduction of production relations. It is in this 
space, therefore, that a new demand now arises: the demand for the 
production or reproduction of 'elemental '  materials ( raw materials, 
energies ) .  What will be the outcome ?  Will this new demand have a 
stimu lating and integrating effect on capitalism, or wil l  it rather be a 
force for disin tegration over the shorter or longer term ? 

When it comes to space, can we legitimately speak of scarcity ? The 
answer is no - because avai lable or vacant spaces are sti l l  to be found 
in unl imited numbers, and even though a relative lack of space may 
have left its mark on some societies (particularly in Asia ) ,  there are 
others where j ust the opposite is true - where, as in North America, 
society bears the clear traces of the vastness of the space open to its 
demographic and technologica l expansion. Indeed the space of nature 
remains open on every side, and thanks to technology we can 'construct' 
whatever and wherever we wish, at the bottom of the ocean,  in desertS 
or on mountaintops - even, if need be, in interplanetary space. 

The fact is that the shortage of space is a distinctly socio-economic _

phenomenon, one which can only be observed, and which only occurs, 
in  quite specific areas, namely in or near urban centres. These may have 
grown up from historical ly established centres, from the old cities, or 
they may have evolved out of new towns. 

The question of central i ty in  general ,  and of urban central i ty i n  
particular, is no t  a very simple one. I t  inhabits every aspect of the 
problematic of space. Germane to mental space as much as to socia l  
space, i t  l inks the two in a manner tha t  surmounts the o ld  philosophical 
distinctions, ri fts and disj unctions between subject and object and 
between intel lectual  and material (or comprehensible and sensible) . Th is 
is not to say that new distinctions and di fferences are not i ntroduced 
thereby. The notion of centrality has a mathematical origin,  as witness 
its appl ication in  the analysis of abstract space. Any given 'point' is a 
point of accumulation : surrounding it is an infini te number of other 
points . Otherwise, we should have no certa inty as to the continu i ty of 
space. At the same time, around each ( isolated) point, a surface -
preferably square - can be described and analysed, as can any variation 
following an infinitesimal change in  its distance from the centre (ds2) .  
Thus each centre may be conceived of in two ways :  as ful l  or empty, 
as infinite or finite .  

In order correctly to frame the question of central ity and a ttempt to 
resolve it, a dialectical approach is in  order. The appropriate method, 
however, is no longer that of  Hegel ,  nor is i t  that of Marx, which was 
based on an analysis of h istorical time, of temporal i ty. I f  we find 
ourselves obl iged to accept the idea of a dia lectical centrality, or of a 
dialectic of central ity, this is because there is a connection between space 
and the dialectic; in other words, there are spatial contradictions which 
imply and explain contradictions in h istorical time, though without 
being reducible to them. Inversely, i f  the notion of contradiction (of 
actual conflict) is not restricted to temporality or h istoricity, i f  it does 
in fact extend to the spatial realm, th is means that a dialectic of centrality 
exists. This dialectical process develops the logical characteristics of 
centres (hitherto understood solely as points ) .  

In  what does the dialectica l movement of centrality consist ? Fi rst of 
a l l ,  central i ty ,  whether mental or social ,  is defined by the gathering­
together and meeting of whatever coexists in a given space. What does 
-coexist in th is way? Everything that can be named and enumerated. 
Centrality is therefore a form, empty in i tself but cal l ing for contents -
:for: objects, natural or artificial beings, things, products and works, signs 
and symbols, people, acts, situations, practical relationships. This means 

.}_l1at centrality closely resembles a logical form - and hence that there

is a logic of centra l i ty. Central ity as a form impl ies s imultaneity,  and it 
is a resu l t  thereof: the s imultaneity of 'everything' that is susceptible of 
coming together - and thus of accumulating - in an act of  thinking or 
in a social act, at a point or around that point. The general concept of 
centra l i ty connects the punctual to the globa l .  According to the orien­
tation of  modern thought first adopted by Nietzsche and s ince taken up 
by a number of thinkers (among them Georges Bata i l le ) ,  the centre or 
focal point is the p lace of  sacrifice, the place where accumulated energies, 
desirous of discharge, must eventual ly explode. Each period, each mode 
of production, each particu lar  society has engendered (produced) i ts 
own centra l i ty :  religious, politica l ,  commercia l ,  cultural ,  industria l ,  and 
so on. The relationsh ip between mental and socia l  centra l i ty must be 
defined for each case. The same goes for the conditions under wh ich a 
given centra l ity wil l  come to an end - whether it ruptu res, explodes, or 
is rent apart. 

Centrality is movable .  We have long known - and recent work, 
notably that of Jean-Pierre Vernant, has confirmed the fact, and elabor­
ated upon it - that the centre of the Greek city was forever being moved : 
from the semici rcu lar  area where chiefs and warriors conferred about 
their expeditions and divided up their booty to the city temple, and 
from the temple to the agora, a place of political assembly (and later, 
thanks to annexed arches and gal leries, of commerce ) .  This means that 
in ancient Greece a complex rela tionship existed between urban space 
and the temporal ity ( rhythms) of u rban l i fe .  The same goes for modern 
cities, and it would not be difficult, for example, to inventory the various 
shifts in central ity that have taken p lace in Paris in the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries : the boulevards, Montmartre, Montparnasse, the 
Champs-Elysees, and so on. 

What makes present-day society d i fferent in  th is regard ? Simply this :  
centra l i ty now aspi res to be total. It  thus lays claim, implicitly or 
explicitly, to a superior pol itical rational ity (a state or 'urban' 
rationa l ity) .  It fal ls  to the agents of the technostructure - to the planners 
- to p rovide the j ustification for this c laim. In so doing, they naturally 
spurn the dialectic ;  and indeed a central ity of this order expels all 
peripheral elements with a violence that is inherent in space itsel f. This 
central ity - or, perhaps better, this central ization - strives to fulfil  its 
'tota l izing' mission with no phi losophy to back it up aside from a 
strategic one (whether conscious or not) . Despite counterva il ing forces, 
some subversive, some tolerable - and tolerated on various grounds · 
( l i bera lization, flexibi l ity, etc . )  - the centre continues effectively to con­
centrate wealth, means of action, knowledge, information and 'culture' .

In short, everyth ing. These capacities and powers are crowned by the 
supreme power, by the abi l i ty to concentrate all powers in the power 
of Decision .  Th is decision-making system makes the ( i l legitimate) claim 
that i t  is rationa l .  

Throughout h istory central ities have  always eventual ly disappeared -
some displaced, some exploded, some subverted. They have perished 
sometimes on account of their excesses - through 'saturation' - and 
sometimes on account of their shortcomings, the chief among which, 
the tendency to expel d issident elements, has a backlash effect. Not that 
these factors are mutual ly exclusive - as witness ancient Rome, which 
suffered both internal saturation and the assaults of peripheral forces. 

The interplay between centre and periphery is thus h ighly complex. 
It mobil izes both logic and dia lectics, and is hence doubly determined. 
If one takes logic, whether formal or applied, as one's frame of reference, 
the dialectic tends to be set aside. Contradictions, however, can never 
be eliminated. I f, on the other hand, one appl ies the dia lectic, which is 
the theory of contradictions, one ends up giving short shift to logic, to 
coherence and cohesiveness. The fact is that neither approach is dispens­
able here. Central ity may give birth to an applied logic (a  strategy ) ;  it  
may also burst asunder  and lose its identity utterly. 

It is primarily in connection with the scarcity of space that the matter 
of centrality has arisen here. The tendency to establish 'centres of 
decision-making' which bring together, with in a l imited area, those 
elements that found society and are therefore usable by power for its 
own purposes promotes a scarcity of space in the area in question -
that is, the area surrounding a central point. Shortage of space has 
original and new characteristics as compared with other kinds of short­
ages, whether ancient or modern. In so far as it results from a historical 
process, it occurs spontaneously, yet i t  is sustained, and often sought 
a.nd organized, by central ly made decisions. It introduces a contradiction 
between past and possi ble future abundance on the one hand and 
actually reigning scarci ty on the other. This contradiction is not 
extraneous to the production relations embodied in space as a whole, 
and even less so to the reproduction of those relations, which i t  is the 
express purpose of  the centres of decision to mainta in ;  at  the same time, 
it.· is a contradiction of space i tself - and not merely in space, after the 

' fashion of the classical contradictions engendered by history and by 
· · h istorical  time. This  must emphatically not be taken as implying that 
· :_contradictions and conflicts in space (deriving from time) have disap­

peared. They are sti l l  present, along with what they imply, along with 
.' ,!_he strategies and tactics to which they give rise, and along, in particular, 



334 CONTR A D I CTO R Y  SPACE 

with the class confl icts that flow from them. The contradictions of space, 
however, envelop historical contradictions, presuppose them, superim­
pose themselves upon them, carry them to a h igher level , and amplify 
them in the process of reproducing them. Once this displacement has 
been effected, the new contradictions may tend to attract a l l  the atten­
tion, diverting interest to themselves and seeming to crowd out or even 
absorb the old conflicts . This impression is fa lse, however. Only by 
means of a dia lectical ana lysis can the precise relationships between 
contradictions in space and contradictions of space be unr avelled, and 
a determination made as to wh ich a re becoming attenuated, wh ich 
accentuated . S imi lar ly ,  the production of things in space has not disap­
peared - and neither have the questions it raises (ownersh ip of the 
means of production, management and control of production) - in face 
of the production of space. But the production of space - including the 
p roduction of the 'elements', as discussed above - does subsume and 
broaden the scope of the problems thrown up by the production of 
th ings. The process of condensation and the centralizing tendency may 
therefore be said also to affect pre-existing contradictions, which they 
duly concentrate, aggravating and modifying them in the process. 

Space is marked out, explored, discovered and rediscovered on a 
colossal scale. Its potential for being occupied, fi l led,  peopled and trans­
formed from top to bottom is continual ly on the increase : the prospect, 
in short, is of a space being produced whose nature is nothing more 
than raw materia ls suffering gradual  destruction by the techniques of 
production. What is more, we now have the means to gather al l  know­
ledge and information, no matter how close or how far away its source 
may be, at a single point where it can be processed ; data collection and 
computer science abolish distance, and they can confidently ignore a 
materia li ty scattered across space (and time) . The theory of centrality 
impl ies a completely new capacity for concentration such as was for­
merly possessed only by the brain - indeed only by the brains of gen iuses. 
Mental centra l i ty and socia l  centrality are l inked by a mediation which 
no doubt has this task as its chief function .  That  mediation is information 
- which in this context cannot become part of knowledge without 
effectively connecting the mental and the socia l .  Paradoxical ly, it is 
p recisely with the advent of this state of a ffa i rs that space shatters. 
Rendered artificia l ly scarce anywhere near a centre so as to increase its 
'va lue', whether wholesale or reta i l ,  it is l iteral ly pulverized and sold off 
in 'lots' or 'parcels ' .  This is the way in which space in p ractice becomes 
the medium of segregations, of the component elements of society as 
they are th rust out towards periphera l zones. And this is the space that

is now sl iced up by a science itself segmented by special ization into 
discrete discip l ines, each of which - and first of al l  political economy 
in its current form - constitutes its own particu lar  space, mental and 
abstract, to be laboriously confronted with social practice. The process 
of sl icing-up, moreover, becomes a 'discipl ine' in  its own right: the 
instrument of knowledge is taken for knowledge itself. The search for 
some unity here is confined to laboured interdiscipl inary or multidiscipli­
nary montages which never manage to fit any of the pieces back together. 
The analytic approach excels only in  the handling of cutting-tools, and 
unification is beyond the reach of partia l  sciences which could only 
regain focus by transforming their methodology, their epistemology, 
their agenda and their ideologies . 

Such is the context of an unfolding 'economic' p rocess which no 
longer answers to classical pol itical economy and wh ich i ndeed defies 
all the computations of the economists. 'Real p roperty' (a long with 
'construction ' )  is no longer a secondary form of circulation, no longer 
the auxil iary and backward branch of  i ndustrial and financial capita l ism 
that it once was. Instead it  has a leading role, albeit in an uneven 
way, for its significance is l iab le to vary according to country, time or 
circumstance. The law of unevenness of growth and development, so 
far from becoming obsolete, is becoming worldwide in its appl ication 
- or, more precisely, i s  presiding over the global ization of a world 
market. 

In the history of capital ism real property has p layed but a minor role .  
For one thing, the rel ics of the former rul ing class long owned not only 
the agricultural land but a l so the land suitable for building; and, sec­
ondly, the relevant branch of production was dominated by trades and 
crafts. The situation of this branch, and of the whole economic sector 
in question, has now changed a lmost everywhere, though most of all i n  
the major industrial ized countries. Capital ism has taken possession of 
the land, and mobilized it to the point where this sector is fast becoming 
central. Why ? Because i t  is a new sector - and hence less beset by the 
obstacles, surfei ts, and miscel l aneous problems that slow down old 
industries. Capital has thus rushed into the production of space in 

· ;preference to the classical forms of production - in preference to the 
production of the means of production (machinery) and that of consumer 
goods. This  process accelerates whenever ' classica l '  sectors show the 
�slightest sign of flagging. The flight of capital towards this favoured 
,!settor can threaten capita l ism's delicate sel f-regulating mechanisms, in 
\vhich case the state may have to intervene. But this does not mean the 
�ljmination of the production of space as a sector which presupposes 



336  C:ONTR A D I C:TO R Y S PACE 

the existence of other forms of circulation but which nevertheless tend1 
ro displace the central activ it ies of corporate capi tal ism. For it is space 
and space alone, that makes possible the deployment of the ( l imited bu 
rea l )  organizational capacity of this type of capita l ism. 

It  sometimes happens, then, that the 'real property' sector is rathe1 
brusquely cal led to order. As a mix of production and specu lation, ofter 
hard to separate out from 'development' , the sector osci l lates betweer 
a subordinate function as a booster, flywheel or back-up - in short a1 
a regul ator - and a leading role. It is therefore part of the genera. 
unevenness of  development, and of the segmentation of the economy a1 
a global rea l ity . At the same time i t  reta ins an  essential function in tha1 
i t  combats the fal l ing rate of profit. Construction, whether private 01 
publ ic, generates h igher-than-average profits in all but the most excep· 
tiona l  cases. Investment in ' real estate', i . e .  in the production of space, 
continues to involve a h igher proportion of variable as compared with 
constant capita l .  The organic composition of capital is weak in this 
sphere, despite the high level of investment ca l led for and despite the 
rapidity of technological progress. Sma l l  and middle-sized businesses 
remain common, whi le excavation and framing ca l l  for a great deal of 
manpower (often immigrant labour ) .  A mass of surplus va lue is thus 
generated, with most being added to the general mass but a sign ificant 
portion returning to construction firms, and to the promoters and 
speculators. As to those problems which arise because obsolescence in 
this a rea tends to be slow, so putting a brake on the circulation of 
capita l ,  they are tackled by a variety of means. The mobil ization of 
space becomes frenetic, and produces an impetus towards the self­
destruction of spaces old and new. Investment and specu lation cannot 
be stopped, however, nor even slowed, and a vicious circle is thus set 
up .  

A strategy based on space, even i f  we leave mil itary and political 
p ro jects out of the picture, must be considered a very dangerous one 
indeed, for it sacrifices the future to immediate interests while simul­
taneously destroying the present in the name of a future at once pro­
grammed and utterly uncertain.  

The mobi l ization of space for the purposes of its production makes 
harsh demands. The process begins, as we have seen, with the land, 
which must first be wrenched away from the traditional form of pro­
perty, from the stabi l ity of patrimon ial  inheritance. Th is cannot be done 
easi ly, or without concessions being made to the landowners (ground 
rents ) .  The mobil ization is next extended to space, including space 
beneath the ground and volumes above it. The enti rety of space must 



CONTRADICTORY SPACE 337  

be endowed with exchange value. And exchange impl ies interchange­
abi l i ty :  the exchangeabi l i ty of a good makes that good into a commodity, 
j ust l ike a quantity of sugar or coa l ;  to be exchangeable, it must be 
comparable with other goods, and indeed with all goods of the same 
type. The 'commodity world' and its characteristics, which formerly 
encompassed only goods and th ings produced in space, their circulation 
and flow, now govern space as a whole, which thus attains the auto­
nomous (or seemingly autonomous) rea l i ty of th ings, of money. 

Exchange value - as Marx showed, in  the wake of the 'classical 
economists' , apropros of products/things - is expressed in  terms of 
money. In the past one bought or rented land. Today what are bought 
(and, less frequently, rented) are volumes of space : rooms, floors, flats, 
apartments, balconies, various faci l i ties (swimming-pool s, tennis courts, 
parking-spaces, etc. ) .  Each exchangeable place enters the chain of com­
mercia l  transactions - of supply and demand, and of prices. The connec­
tion of prices with 'production costs' - i.e. with the average socia l  labour 
time required by production - is an increasingly e last ic one, moreover. 
This relationsh ip, l i ke others, is disturbed and complicated by a variety 
of factors, notably by speculation. The ' truth of p rices' tends to lose its 
validity: p rices are more and more i ndependent of value and of pro­
duction costs, while the operation of economic laws - the law of value 
and the law of supply and demand, or ( i f  non-Marxist terminology is 
preferred) the interactions between desirabi l i ty and profit margins - is 
compromised. Fraud itse l f  now becomes a law, a rule of the game, an 
accepted tactic. 

The need for comparabi l i ty has been met by the production of virtual ly 
identical 'cel l s ' .  Th is is a wel l-known fact - one that no longer surprises 
anyone. It seems 'natura l ' ,  even though it  has hardly ever been explained 
- and then very poorly .  Yet its apparent naturalness i tself cries out for 
explanation. Th is is the triumph of homogeneity. From the point of 
view of the 'user', going from one 'cel l '  to another can mean 'going 
home' . The theory of 'modules' and its practical appl ication have made 
it· possible to reproduce such cel ls ,  taken as 'models ' ,  ad infinitum. Space 
is thus produced and reproduced as reproducible. Vertica l ity, and the 
independence of volumes with respect to the original  land and its 
.pecul iarities, are, p recisely, produced : Le Corbusier thrust built volumes 
'.. into abstraction, separating them from the earth by means of pi les and 
pillars, on the pretext that he was exposing them to open a i r  and 
·sunshine. At the same time - l i tera l ly - volumes a re treated as surfaces, 
:as a heap of 'plans' ,  without any account being taken of  t ime. Not that 
ti.me disappears completely in the case of abstractions thus erected, made 



338  CONTRADICTO R Y  S PACE 

vertical ,  and made visual .  The fact is, however, that the 'needs' about 
which we hear so much are forced under the yoke - or, rather, th rough 
the fi lter - of space. The truth, in fact, is that these needs are resu l ts 
and not causes - that they are subproducts of space. Exchangeabi l i ty 
and its constraints (which are presented as norms) apply not only to 
surfaces and volumes but a lso to the paths that lead to and from them. 
All  of which is j ustified on plans and drawings by the 'graphic synthesis' 
of body and gesture that is al legedly achievable in architectural pro­
jects. 13 The graphic elements involved ( i n  drawings, sections, elevations, 
visual tableaux with s i lhouettes or figures, etc. ) ,  which are fami l iar to 
archi tects, serve as reducers of the real i ty they claim to represent - a 
rea l i ty that is in any case no more than a modality of an accepted ( i . e. 
imposed) ' l i festyle' in  a particular  type of  housing (suburban vi l la ,  high­
rise, etc. ) .  A 'normal '  l i festy le  means a normalized l i festyle .  Meanwhile, 
the reference to the body { the 'modulor' ) ,  a long with the figures and 
the promotional patter, serve l i terally to 'naturalize '  the space thus 
produced, as artificial as it may be. 

For all that a rchitectural projects have a seeming objectivity, for all 
that the producers of space may occasional ly have the best intentions 
in the world, the fact is that volumes are invariably dealt with in a way 
that refers the space in question back to the land, to a land that is still 
privately (and privatively) owned ; bui l t-up space is thus emancipated 
from the land in appearance only. At the same time, it is treated as an 
empty abstraction, at  once geometric and visual in character. This 
relationship - a real connection concea led beneath an apparent separ­
ation and constituting a veritable Gordian knot - is both a practice and 
an ideology : an ideology whose practitioners are unaware that their 
activity is of an ideological nature, even though their every gesture 
makes this fact concrete. The supposed solutions of the planners thus 
impose the constraints of exchangeabi l i ty on everyday l i fe, while pre­
senting them as both natural (or normal )  and te

.
chnical requirements -

and often also as moral necessities ( requirements of publ ic morality). 
Here - as ever - the economic sphere that Marx denounced as the 
organization of asceticism makes common cause with the moral order. 
'Private '  property entai ls private l i fe - and hence privation. And this in 
turn implies a repressive ideology in socia l  practice - and vice versa, so 
that each masks the other. Spatial interchangeabil ity inevitably brings a 
powerful tendency towards quantification in its train, a tendency which 
natural ly extends outwards into the surroundings of the housing itsel f 

1 3 See A. de Vi l l anova, in Espaces et Societe, no. 3 ,  p. 238 .  



CONTR A D I CTO R Y  SPACE 339  
- into chose areas variously represented as the environment, transitional 
spaces, means of access, faci l i ties, and so on . Supposedly natural features 
are swa l lowed up by this homogenization - not only physical sites but 
also bodies - the bodies, specifical ly, of  the inhabitants (or 'users ' ) . 
Quantification in this context is technical in appearance, financial  in 
real ity, and moral in essence. 

Should use value be expected to disappear ?  Cou ld the homogen ization 
of fragments sca ttered th rough space, a long with their commercial inter­
changeabi l i ty, lead to an absolute primacy of exchange and exchange 
value ? And could exchange value come to be defined by the signs of 
prestige or 'status' - i .e .  by di fferences internal to the system, regu lated 
by the relationship of specific locations to centres - with the result that 
the exchange of signs would absorb use value and supersede practical 
considerations rooted in production and in  p roduction costs ? 

The answer to these questions must be negative : the acquirer  of space 
is sti l l  buying a use value. What is that use value ? First of a l l ,  he is 
buying an inhabitable space commensurate with other such spaces, and 
semiological ly stamped by a promotional  discourse and by the signs of 
a certain degree of 'distinction ' .  That is not a l l ,  however: a lso purchased 
is a particu lar  distance - the distance from the purchaser's dwel l ing­
place to other places, to centres of commerce, work, leisure, culture or 
decision . Here time once more has a role to play, even though a space 
that is both programmed and fragmented tends to el iminate i t  as such . 
Admittedly  the archi tect, the promoter or even the occupier can compen­
sate for the shortcomings of a given location by i ntroducing signs: signs 
of status, signs of happiness, signs of ' l i fesryle', and so on. Such signs 
are bought and sold despite their abstract nature, despite their concrete 
insignificance, and despite their over-significance (in that they procla im 
.their meaning - namely, compensation ) .  Their  price is s imply added to 
the real exchange value.  The fact remains that  a home-buyer buys a 
daily schedule, and that this constitutes part of the use va lue of the 
space acquired. Any schedule has pros and cons, involves the losing or 
saving of t ime, and hence something other than signs - to wit, a practice. 
The consumption of space has very specific features. It di ffers, of course, 
:from the consumption of  things in space, but this difference concerns 
more than j ust signs and meanings. Space is the envelope of time. When 

':�pace is spl it ,  time is distanced - but i t  resists reduction . Within and

XVIII 

I f  we are to c lar ify the categories and concepts relating to the production 
of space, we shal l  need to return to Marx's concepts - and not only to 
those of socia l  labour and production .  What is a commodity ? A concrete 
abstraction. An abstraction , certa in ly - but not an abstraction in spite 
of its status as a thing; an abstraction, on the contrary, on account of 
its status as a socia l  ' th ing', divorced, during its existence, from its 
materia l ity, from the use to which it is put, from productive activity, 
and from the need that it satisfies. And concrete, j ust as certa inly, by 
vi rtue of i ts practical power. The commodity is a social 'being-there', 
an 'object' i rreducible to the phi losophical concept of the Object. The 
commodity h ides in stores, in warehouses - in inventory. Yet it has no 
mystery comparable to the mystery of nature. The enigma of the com­
modity is entirely socia l .  It is the enigma of money and property, of 
specific needs and the demand-money-satisfaction cycle. The com­
modity asks for nothing better than to appear. And appear it does -
visible/readable, in shop windows and on display racks. Sel f-exh ibition 
is its forte. Once it is  apparent, there is no call to decode it; it has no 
need of decipherment a fter the fashion of the 'beings' of nature and of 
the imagination. And yet, once i t  has appeared, its mystery only deepens. 
Who has produced i t ?  Who wi l l  buy i t ?  Who wil l  profit from i ts sale? 
Who, or what purpose, will i t  serve ? Where will the money go ? The 
commodity does not answer these questions ;  it is s imply there, exposed 
to the gaze of passers-by, in a setting more or less al luring, more or less 
exh ibit ionistic, be it in a nondescript small shop or in a gli ttering 
department store. 

The cha in of  commodities parallels the circuits and networks of 
exchange.  There is a language and a world of the commodity .  Hence also 
a logic and a strategy of the commodity. The genesis and development of 
this world, this discourse and this logic were portrayed by Marx. The 
commodity assumed a role in society very early on, before h istory, but 
that role was l imited, coexisting with those of barter and of the gift. Its 
status grew, however, in the cities of the ancient world, and above all 
in the medieval towns. It then gave rise to commercia l  capital, to the , 
conquest o f  the oceans and of distant lands - and hence a lso to the �rst

adumbration of  the  world market. Upon this h istorical basis industrial 
capital ism was founded - a great leap forward for the commodity, 
putting it on course for the conquest of  the world - i .e .  the conquest 
of space. Ever s ince, the world market has done nothing but expand (so 
to speak) .  The actual ization of the worldwide dimension, as a concrete 
abstraction ,  is under way. 'Everyth ing' - the tota l i ty - is bought and 
sold .  'Theological subtlety', wrote Marx apropos of the commodity 
and its characteristics. He was right to speak of subtlety, because the 
abstraction involved attains a most remarkable complexity . He was 
right, a lso, to use the word 'theologica l ' ,  because the commodity as 
concrete abstraction acts as the power of determinate ' beings' (human 
groups, fractions of  classes ) .  The commodity is a thing: i t is in space, 
and occupies a location. Chains of commodities (networks of exchange) 
are consti tuted and articu lated on a world scale :  transportation net­
works, buying- and sel l ing-networks (the circu lation of  money, transfers 
of capi ta l ) .  Linking commodities together in virtual ly infin i te numbers, 
the commodity world brings in i ts wake certain attitudes towards space, 
certain actions upon space, even a certain  concept of space. Indeed, a l l  
the commodity chains, circulatory systems and networks, connected on 
high by Gold, the god of exchange, do have a distinct homogeneity. 
Exchangeabi l i ty, as we have seen, implies interchangeabi l i ty .  Yet each 
location, each link in a chain of commodities, is occupied by a thing 
whose particu lar traits become more marked once they become fixed, 
and the longer they remain fixed, a t  that site ; a thing, moreover, com­
posed of matter l iable to spoil or soi l ,  a thing having weight and 
depending upon the very forces that threaten it ,  a thing wh ich can 
deteriorate i f  its owner (the merchant) does not protect it . The space of 
the commodity may thus be defined as a homogeneity made up of 
specificities. Th is is a paradox new to our present discussion : we are no 
longer concerned either with the representation of  space or with a 
representational space, but rather with a practice. Exchange with its 
circulatory systems and networks may occupy space worldwide, but 
consumption occurs only i n  th is  or that particu lar  p lace. A specific 
individual, with a specific dai ly schedule, seeks a particu lar  satisfaction. 
·Use value constitutes the only rea l  wealth, and this fact helps to restore 

. its i l l -appreciated importance. The paradigmatic (or 'sign ificant ' )  oppo­
·,sition between exchange and use, between global networks and the 
:determinate locations of  production and consumption, is transformed 
here into a dialectical contradiction, and in the process it becomes 
spatia l .  Space thus understood is both abstract and concrete in  character :  

, ._aQstract inasmuch as it has no existence save by virtue of the exchange-



342 CONTRA D I CTO R Y  SPACE 
abi l i ty of  all its component parts, and concrete inasmuch as it is social ly 
real  and as such localized. This  is a space, therefore, that is homogeneous 
yet at the same time broken up into fragments .  

The commodity in its social expression and the commodity world 
must not be a l lowed to obfuscate a truth even more concrete than social 
existence. We know that there are many markets, existing on many 
levels (local, regional ,  national ,  worldwide) : the market for (material ) 
commodities, the labour market, the market for capita l ,  the market in  
leases (whether for agricultural land or for bui lding-land) ,  the market 
for works, signs and symbols, and so forth . These different markets 
constitute a unity, namely the world market understood in the broadest 
possible sense. They are all connected, yet all retain their distinctness . 
They are superimposed upon one another without becoming confused 
with one another, spaces in terpenetrating according to a law already 
evoked above - the law of composition of non-strategic spaces, which 
is ana logous to the physical law of superimposition and composition of 
smal l  movements. There are two markets whose conquest represents the 
ult imate triumph of the commodity and of money : the market in land 
( a  p recapitalist form of property) and the market in works (which, as 
'non-products' ,  long remained extra-capital ist ) . 

The commodity , along with its implications - networks of exchange, 
currency, money - may be looked upon as a component of social 
(practical )  existence, as a ' formant' of space. Considered in isolation, 
'in i tself', however, it does not have the capacity, even on a world scale, 
to exist socia l ly (practical ly ) . And it is in this sense that it remains an 
abstraction, even though , qua 'thing', i t  is endowed with a terrible, 
a lmost deadly, power. The 'commodity world' cannot exist for itself. 
For it to exist, there must be labour. It is the result of a productive 
activity. Every commodity is a product (of a division of labour, of a 
technical means, of an expenditure of energy - in short, of a force of 
production) .  Under this aspect a lso the concept must be spatialized if it 
is to become concrete. The commodity needs its space too.

A curious fate has been reserved for Marxism, for Marxist thought, for 
the categories, concepts and theories referred to as 'Marxist' .  No sooner 
is Marx pronounced dead than Marxism experiences a resurgence. On ._ 
reinspection, the classical texts emerge as far richer than had been 
supposed: often confused, even contradictory, they yield new meanings:.. 



CONTRADICTO R Y  SPACE 343 
Some, such as the Grundrisse not many years ago, or the Manuscripts 
of 1 844 around 1 930, have successfu l ly revived a seemingly exhausted 
line of thought .  

Each period in the development of modern society - and perhaps 
even each country - has had ' its' Marxism. 'Mainstream'  Marxism, 
meanwh ile, has made many wrong turns, deviating variously into philo­
sophism, historicism or economism. By contrast, a number of concepts 
whose ' theoretical status' original ly occasioned much controversy - that 
of alienation, for example - have ultimately enjoyed bri l l iant  careers as 
truly enl igh tening notions. 

The scientific and technological changes of the modern world have 
now made a reconsideration of Marxist thought inevitable. The thesis 
presented here might be summarized as fol lows. Each of the concepts 
of Marxism may be taken up once more, and carried to a h igher level , 
without any sign ificant moment of the theory as a whole being lost. On 
the other hand, i f  they are considered in the setting of Marx's exposition, 
these concepts and their theoretical articu lation no longer have an object. 
The renewal of Marx's concepts is best effected by taking ful l  account 
of space. 

xx 

For Marx, nature belonged among the forces of production . Today a 
distinction is called for that Marx did not draw: namely, that between 
the domination and the appropriation of nature. Domination by tech­
nology tends towards non-appropriation - i .e .  towards destruction.  Th is 
is not to say that such destruction must inevitably occur, but merely 
that there is a conflict between domination and appropriation. Th is 
conflict takes place in  space. There are dominated spaces and there are 
appropriated spaces. 

That is not the whole story, however. Nature appears today as a 
source and as a resource : as the source of energies - indispensable, vast, 

,but not unlimited. It appears, more clearly than in Marx 's time, as a 
.)source of use value. The tendency toward the destruction of nature does 
-: not flow solely from a brutal technology: it is also precipi tated by the 
.economic wish to impose the traits and criteria of interchangeabi l ity 

.
upon places. The result is that places are deprived of their specificity -
Qr even abolished. At an even more general level, it wi l l  be recalled that 
t,he

1 products of labour become commodities in  the process of exchange.  
ffhis means that their material characteristics are placed in abeyance, 



344 CONTRA D I CTO R Y  SPACE 
along with the needs to which they correspond.  Only at the moment 
when the exchange cycle is completed, the moment j ust prior to con­
sumption, do we observe the re-emergence of the product's materia l i ty, 
and of the need it answers - the re-emergence, in other words, of 
whatever natural (materia l ,  im mediate) aspects sti l l  attach to the pro­
ducts of industry and of social labour. As source and resource, nature 
spatializes the concepts associated with it , among them the concept of 
productive consumption, of which Marx made great use bur which has 
since been abandoned. Productive consumption always e l iminates a 
material or natural  rea l ity - an energy , a quantity of labour power, or 
an apparatus. It uses (up ) : it is a use and a use value. It a lso produces. 

Let us for a moment consider the machine. Marx (along with Charles 
Babbage, whose work he drew upon) was one of the first to bring out 
the importance of the machine - a mechanism di ffering from a simple 
tool, as from a set of tools brought together in a workshop where both 
workers and tools are subject to a division of labour. A machine draws 
energy from a natural source (at first water, then steam, and later still 
electricity) and uses it to perform a sequence of productive tasks. The 
worker, instead of manipulating a tool ,  now serves a machine. The 
resu l t  is a radical but contradictory transformation of the productive 
process : whereas labour is ever more divided and segmented, the 
machine is organized into an ensemble that is ever vaster, ever more 
cohesive, ever more unified, and ever more productive. 

Machines originated in the country, not in the towns.  The windmill 
and the loom - prototypical mach ines - were rural inventions. The 
earliest machines were improved and perfected on the basis of the type 
of energy (hydraulic, for example) that they employed, and with respect 
to the kind of materials that they processed (wool, cotton, etc. ) .  From 
their beginnings, however, machines had the potential to generate some­
th ing completely new, namely the automation of the production process; 
hence also a new rational i ty, and - ult imately - an end to labour itself. 

With the rise of industry, the extension of the market, the advent of 
the commodity world - in short, with the new i mportance taken on by 
the economic sphere, by capita l ism - the old towns, finding themselves 
assa i led from a l l  sides, had to make room for something else. All 
their compartmental izations - physica l walls, guilds, local oligarchies, :­
restricted markets and controlled terrirories - had to be dismantled. 
Meanwhile, the machine developed apace, in tandem with capital inve�t- ., 
ment. The general ly accepted periodization proposed for the decline of 
the towns (palaeo-technical ,  neo-technical ,  pre-modern and technologi­
cal stages) does not, however, give us an exact or complete idea of what _ : ,  



CONTRAO !CTOR Y SPACE 345 

actua l ly took place .  Had the town of the precapital ist era been pre­
machine, so to speak, in  its essence, it would surely have disappeared 
completely, just l ike its various compartmental izations ;  in  actuality, so 
far from disappea ring, it endured and - albeit transformed - expanded. 
The fact is that the town itse lf  was a l ready a vast machine, an automaton,  
capturing natura l  energies and consuming them productively. Over the 
centuries, the town's internal and external arrangements - the functions, 
forms and structu res of its productive consumption - have metamor­
phosed .  History, in a rather simple sense of the word, has lent impetus 
to extensions and e laborations of these spatia l  arrangements as well as 
to the introduction of connections - of sewers, water supply, l ighting, 
transportation, energy delivery (or flow) ,  information channels, and 
so forth . Urban productiv i ty has increased incessantly, thanks to the 
proximity of, and the l inks between, the needed elements: in  this regard 
the town has come over time to resemble an industrial plant rather than 
a workshop, though i t  has never become identical to such a plant .  I t  i s  
clear, therefore, that the town at a very ear ly stage displayed certain 
characteristics of the mach ine or automaton, and even that it  was a 
pioneer in this respect. The town is indeed a machine, but it is a lso 
something more, and something better: a machine appropriated to a 
certain use - to the use of a social group. As a 'second nature' ,  as a 
produced space, the town has also reta ined - and this even during its 
crisis - certain natural traits, notably the importance assigned to use. 

In the context of the expansion of capital ism, there is a need to 
reconsider the concept of fixed (or constant) capita l ,  for this concept 
:can no longer be confined in  i ts connotations to the equipment, premises 
and raw materials of a given enterprise. According to Marx, fixed capital 
is the measure of social wealth. Quite obviously, this category must 
_cover investment in space, such as h ighways or airports, as  well as a l l  
sorts of infrastructural elements. How could the radar networks used 
to designate a irways not be classified as fixed capita l ?  These are aids of 
a new kind which the roads, canals and railways of an earl ier period 
:prefigured in only the faintest way. Transportation grids exempl i fy 
.productive consumption, in the first place because they serve to move 
\p.eople and things th rough the circui ts of exchange, and secondly because 
<they constitute a worldwide investment of knowledge in  socia l  rea l ity. 
;:i, Such an extension of the notion of fixed capital a l lows us s imi larly 
:fo ,extend the notion of variable capita l .  And this with surprising results, 
fcfr, contrary to many p redictions, the incorporation of knowledge and 
te�hnology into production has mobi l ized a considerable labour force, 
including the mass of workers, not h ighly ski l led, needed for such tasks

as excavation, construction and maintenance. Th is development  has 
indeed offerea rel ief to a capital ism suffering from the fact that the high 
organic composition of capital in the most advanced industries tends to 
reduce necessary labour time (for the working class to reproduce itself 
as labour power) , and therefore to th reaten the minimal necessary level 
of avai lable manpower; this s i tuation further frees an enormous quanti ty 
of socia l  t ime (whence the importance assumed by leisure and by 'cul­
tural '  and other parasit ic forms) ,  as well as making for colossal surplus 
production, excess (floating) capital, and so on.  Not that the production 
of space is solely responsible for the survival of capita l ism : it is in no 
sense independent of the extension of capital ism to pre-existing space. 
Rather, it is the overal l  situation - spatial practi ce in its entirety - that 
has saved capital ism from extinction. 

In describing the organic composition of capita l i sm, Marx added 
another socio-economic average to those averages whose functions and 
structures he had a l ready ana lysed : average social labour and average 
rate of profit. When it takes the average organic composition of capital 
into account, theory rejoins socia l  space - i .e. i t  ceases to operate in an 
abstract space. Th is average is only meaningfu l in connection with a 
specific space :  the space, say, that is occupied by a branch of industry 
or, even better, by an economic entity of great scale - a country or a 
continent. At the level of a single factory it has no ut i l ity at a l l ,  save as 
it permits comparison of the organic composition of capital in that 
particu lar  concern with the average in society at large. This concept 
comes truly into its own when appl ied worldwide, for there is a global 
organic  composition of capital which subsumes the averages obtaining in 
specific countries or nations. The notion becomes concrete by becoming 
spatial (and vice versa : it is spatial ized as it achieves concreteness) .  Here 
we find ourselves at the junction of political economy and its critique, 
as defined by Marx, on the one hand, and, on the other, a political 
economy of space ( including its cri tique, which is a crit ique of states 
and of state powers holding sway over national territories) .  A theory 
based on the idea of organic composition would al low us to grasp the 
relationship between entities unequal in this regard, and to identify the 
consequences of those inequal ities. For these result  in transfers of value 
and of surp lus  va lue, and therefore of capita l ,  as wel l  as in contradictions 
with in  the capital market which give rise to monetary problems. 1 4  In

che obscacles in che way of growth and developmenc become increasingly 
dauncing. Meanwhile, the advanced councries use the more backward 
as a source of labour and as a resource for use values (energies, raw 
macerials, qual i tacively superior spaces for le isure activi cies ) ;  the Spain 
of coday exempl ifies this perfectly. 

Space in i ts enti rety enters the modernized capital ist mode of pro­
duction, there co be used for che generation of surplus value. The earch, 
underground resou rces, the a ir  and l ighc above che ground - al l  are part 
of the forces of production and part of che products of chose forces. 
The urban fabric, with its mu ltiple necworks of communication and 
exchange, is l ikewise pare of the means of production . The cown and 
its mult ifarious establ ishmencs (ics pose offices and railway stacions - as 
also its storehouses, transporcation systems and varied services) are fixed 
capital .  The division of labour a ffects the whole of space - not just the 
'space of work' ,  not just the faccory floor. And che whole of space is 
an objecc of productive consumption, j ust l ike factory bui ld ings and 
plant, machinery, raw materia ls ,  and labour power itsel f. 

In parallel with these developmencs, the real ization of surplus value 
has ceased to occu r solely within an area close to the point of production, 
confined to a local banking-system. Instead, this p rocess takes place 
through a worldwide banking-network as pare of the abstract relations 
(the manipulation of the wri tten word) between financial agencies and 
institutions. The rea lization of surplus value has, so to speak, been 
'deterritorial ized' .  Urban space, though it has thus lose ics former role 
in this process, nevertheless cont inues to ensure thac l inks are properly 
maintained between the various flows involved : flows of energy and 
labour, of commodities and capita l .  The economy may be defined, 
practical ly speak ing, as the l inkage between flows and networks, a 
linkage guaranceed in a more or less rational way by institutions and 
programmed co work within the spacial framework where chese inst i­
:�utions exercise operational influence. Each flow is  of course defined by :its origin, its endpoint, and its path. But, whi le i t  may thus be defined 
separately, a flow is only effective co the extenc that it enters into 
relationship with ochers; the use of  an energy flow, for instance, is 
meaningless without a corresponding flow of raw materia ls .  The co­
ordination of such flows occurs within a space. As for the distribution 
()f surplus value, this too is ach ieved spatial ly - territorial ly - as a Jl)nction of the forces in  play (countries, economic sectors) and as a 
·:function of the strategies and know-how of managers.

According to Marx (and his thesis is not unpersuasive) , tools, machinery, 
premises, raw materials - in short, constant capital or, in current ( and 
hence capital ist) parlance, investments - represent dead labour. In this 
way past activ ity crysta l l izes, as i t  were, and becomes a precondition 
for new activity .  Current work , including brain work, takes up the 
resu l ts of the past and revivifies them. Under capita lism, however, what 
is  dead takes hold of what is a l ive. In  other words, the means of 
production belong to the individual capital ist and to the bourgeoisie as 
a class, and a re used by chem to retain  their hold over the working 
class, to make that class work. In this context as in any other, a new 
society can only be defined as a turning of the world upon its head. But 
how could what is al ive lay hold of what is dead ? The answer is : 
through the production of space, whereby l iving labour can produce 
someth ing that is no longer a thing, nor s imply a set of tools, nor simply 
a com modity .  In  space needs and desires can reappear as such, informing 
both the act of producing and its products. There sti l l  exist - and 
there may exist in the future - spaces for play, spaces for enjoyment, 
architectures of wisdom or pleasure. In and by means of space, the work 
may shine through the product, use value may ga in the upper hand over 
exchange value :  appropriation, turning the world upon its head, may 
(virtua l ly )  achieve dominion over domination, as the imaginary and the 
utopian incorporate {or are incorporated into) the rea l .  What we have 
cal led a 'second nature' may replace the fi rst, standing in for it or 
superimposing i tself upon it without wreaking complete destruction . So 
long, however, as the dead reta ins its hold over the l iving, destruction 
and sel f-destruction wil l  be imminent threats. Being equal ly dependent 
on this whole (which, in the sphere of knowledge, is  cal led 'reduction'), 
capita l ism and the bourgeoisie can ach ieve noth ing but abstractions: 
money and commodities, capital i tse lf, and hence abstract labour ( labour 
in genera l ,  the production of exchange value in general )  within abstract 
space - the location and source of abstractions.

in mind their theoretical l inks ,  we may say of socia l  space that ' : it

rgruggle. The production of space goes hand in hand with a new empha-

sis on 'nature' as source of use values (the material ity of things) . Long 
a consumer of part of the surpluses of the exchange system (of social 
surplus p roduction) ,  the production of space has thus risen to promi­
nence in paral le l  with the restoration of  use value, a restoration occurring 
on a vast scale  and affecting politics th rough and through - without, 
however, resolving itse l f  into political strategies . For Marx nature was 
the only true wealth, and he carefu l ly  distinguished such wealth from 
fortunes measurable in terms of exchange value, in terms of money or 
specie. This idea remains true and profound, provided always that 
secondary (produced) space is not arbitrari ly d ivorced, as i f  i t  embodied 
some particu lar  significance, from the primary space of nature, wh ich 
is  the raw materia l  and the matrix of production . The supreme good is 
time-space ; this is what ensures the survival of being, the energy that 
being contains and has at i ts disposal . 

Capital ism does not consol idate itse l f  solely by consolidating its hold 
on the land, or solely by incorporating h istory's precapital ist formations. 
It also makes use of all the avai lable abstractions, all avai lable forms, 
and even the j u ridica l  and lega l fiction of ownership of th ings apparently 
inaccessible to privative appropriation (private property) : nature, the 
earth , l i fe energies, desi res and needs. Spatial p lanning, which uses space 
as a mult ipurpose tool ,  has shown itse l f  to be extremely effective. Such 
an instrumental use of space is surely impl icit in the 'conservative 
modernization' that has been introduced with varying degrees of success 
in many countries. 

The foregoing remarks on scarcity, on central ity, on the 'mobil ization 
of immovables' have at most offered only the barest outl ine of a poli tical 
economy of space. The reason why such a polit ical economy wil l  not 
be further e laborated upon here is that it is an offshoot of a more 
powerful theory : the theory of the production of space. Does our present 
inquiry ,  focused as it is on space and on the set of problems attending 
it , point in the di rection of a form of knowledge susceptible of replacing 
'classica l '  pol itical economy and its abstract models of development? 
Undoubtedly, yes . But it has to be made clear at the outset that the 
'positive' and 'negative' ( i .e .  critica l )  aspects of such a theory will 
converge. The 'commodity world ' ,  which is an abstraction, cannot be 
conceived of apart from the world market, which is defined territorially 
(in terms of flows and networks) and poli tica l ly (in terms of centres and 
peripheries) .  The notion of flows - a strictly economic notion that has 
been mistakenly  general ized by some phi losophers - is still not clearly 
understood ; along with their spatial interconnections, flows, by reasons 
of their complexity, st i l l  l ie  beyond the ana lytic and programming

capacities o f  the computer. The fetishism o f  an abstract economics i s  
being transformed into the fetishism of an abstract economic space. 
Space-become-commodity develops the traits of commodities in space 
to the maximum. 

In order to elevate experience of this space to the level of theoretical 
knowledge i t  wil l be necessary to introduce new categories while s imul­
taneously refining some old and fami l iar themes. The analysis of space 
envelopes may be expected to take markets ( loca l ,  national ,  and hence 
also worldwide) as its starting-point, and eventual ly to l ink up with the 
theory of networks and flows. And the theory of use value, so badly 
obscured and misapprehended since Marx, wil l  be restored and retu rned, 
complete with its complexities, to i ts former standing. 

How and why is it  that the advent of a world market, implying a 
degree of unity at the level of the planet, gives rise to a fractioning of 
space - to prol iferating nation states, to regional d ifferentiation and 
self-determination, as wel l  as to multinational states and transnational 
corporations which, a l though they stem this strange tendency towards 
fission, a lso exploit i t  in  order to reinforce their own autonomy?  
Towards what  space and time wi l l  such interwoven contradictions lead 
us? 

We know with some degree of accuracy where surplus value is formed 
under present conditions ;  we have but a scant notion, however, of where 
it is real ized, or how it is divided up, because banking and financial 
networks scatter it far from the places ( factories, countries) that generate 
it. Final ly, space is also being recast : i n  response to the growth of a ir  
transport, particularly in  i ts geopol itical dimensions; in response to 
various new industries (computers, leisure, the extraction of petroleum 
and other resources) ;  and in response to the expanding role of the 
multinationals .  

It  is to be hoped that, at the conclusion of an analytical and critical 
study such as the one here envisioned, the rela tionsh ip between time 
and space would no longer be one of  abstract separation coupled with 
an equally abstract con fusion between these two different yet closely 
connected terms.

From the Contradictions of Space 

to Differential Space 

I 

Let us now review the theory of contradictory space by considering the 
contradictions in abstract space one by one. Just as white l ight, though 
un i form in appearance, may be broken down i nto a spectrum, space 
l ikewise decomposes when subjected to analysis ;  in the case of space, 
however, the knowledge to be derived from analysis extends to the 
recognition of conflicts internal to what on the surface appears homo­
geneous and coherent - and presents itse l f  and behaves as though it 
were. 

The first contradiction on our list is that between quantity and quality. 
Abstract space is measurable. Not only is it quantifiable as geometrical 
space, but, as socia l  space, it is subject to quantitative manipulations : 
statistics, programming, projections - a l l  a re operational ly effective here. 
The dominant tendency, therefore, is towards the disappearance of the 
qual i tative, towards its assimilation subsequent upon such brutal or 
seductive treatment. 

And yet in the end the qual itative successful ly resists resorption by 
the quantitative - just as use resists resorption by value. Instead, it re· 
emerges in space .  A moment comes when people in general leave the 
space of consumption, which coincides with the h istorical locations of 
capital accumulation, with the space of production, and with the space 
that is produced ; this is the space of the market, the space through 
which flows fol low their paths, the space which the state controls - a 
space, therefore, that is strictly quantified. When people leave this space, 
they move towards the cons11mption of space (an unproductive form of 



CONTRA D I CTI O N S  OF SPACE TO DIFFERENTIAL SPACE 353 

:onsumption ) .  Th is moment is the  moment of departure - the moment 
)f people's hol idays, formerly a contingent but now a necessary moment. 
When this moment arrives, 'people' demand a qual i tative space. The 
�ual ities they seek have names:  sun, snow, sea . Whether these are 
11atural or s imulated matters l itt le . Neither spectacle nor mere signs a re 
1cceptable. What is wanted is materia l i ty and naturalness as such, 
rediscovered in their (apparent or rea l )  immediacy. Ancient names, and 
eternal - and al legedly natural - qual i ties. Thus the quality and the use 
of space retrieve their ascendancy - but only up to a point .  In empirical 
terms, what this means is that neocapital ism and neo-imperial ism share 
hegemony over a subordinated space spl i t  into two kinds of regions : 
regions exploited for the purpose of and by means of production (of 
consumer goods) ,  and regions exploited for the purpose of and by means 
of the consumption of space. Tourism and leisure become major areas 
of investment and profitabi l ity ,  adding their weight to the construction 
sector, to property speculation, to general ized urbanization (not to 
mention the integration into capital ism of agricul ture, food production, 
etc. ) .  No sooner does the Mediterranean coast become a space offering 
leisure activit ies to industrial Europe than industry arrives there; but 
nostalgia for towns dedicated to le isure, spread out in the sunshine, 
continues to haunt the urbanite of  the super-industrial ized regions. Thus 
the contradictions become more acute - and the urbanites continue to 
clamour for a certa in 'qual ity of space ' .  

In the areas set  aside for leisure, the body regains a certain  right to 
use, a right which is ha l f  imaginary and ha lf  rea l ,  and which does not 
go beyond an i l lusory 'culture of the body', an imitation of natural l i fe. 
Nevertheless, even a reinstatement of the body's rights tha t  remains 
unfulfilled effectively cal ls for a corresponding restoration of des i re and 
pleasure. The fact is that consumption satisfies needs, and that leisure 
and desire, even if they are united only in a representation of space ( in 
which everyday l i fe is put in brackets and temporari ly replaced by a 
different, richer, s impler and more normal l i fe ) ,  are indeed brought into 
conjunction ; consequently, needs and desi res come into opposition with 
each other. Specific needs have specific objects. Desire, on the other 
hand, has no particu lar object, except for a space where i t  has ful l  p lay :  
a beach, a place of festivity, the space of  the dream.  

The dia lectical l ink (meaning the contradiction within a un i ty )  between 
need and desire thus generates fresh contradictions - notably that 
between l iberation and repression. Even though it  is true that these 
;dialectical processes have the middle classes as their only foundation, 
their only vehicle, and that these middle classes offer models of consump-

tion to the so-called lower classes, in  this case such mimesis may, under 
the pressure of the contradiction in question, be an effect ive st imulus .  
A passionate struggle takes p lace in art ,  and within artists themselves, 
the essential character of wh ich the protagonists fai l  to recognize ( it is 
in face class struggle ! ) :  the struggle between body and non-body, between 
signs of the body and signs of non-body. 

Meneal space - the space of reductions, of force and repression, of 
manipulation and co-optation, the destroyer of nature and of the body 
- is qu ite unable to neutralize the enemy within its gates. Far from it :  
it actual ly encourages that enemy, actual ly helps to revive it .  Which 
takes us far further than the often-mentioned contradictions between 
aesthetics and rational ism. 

II 

The above-mentioned quantity-qual ity contradiction is not grounded in 
a ( bi nary) opposition but rather in a three-point interaction, in a move­
ment from the space of consumption to the consumption of space via 
le isure and within the space of leisure; in other words, from the quotidian 
to the non-quotidian th rough festival (whether feigned or not, s imulated 
or 'authentic' ) ,  or again from labour co non-labour through a putting 
into brackets and into question ( in a ha l f- imaginary, ha l f-real way) of 
toi l .  

Another (b inary)  opposition seems h ighly pertinent, even though i t  
serves to  freeze the  dialectical process. Th is is the  opposition between 
production and consumption, which, though transformed by ideology 
into a structure, cannot completely mask the dialectical conflict sug­
gested by the term 'productive consumption' .  The movement glimpsed 
here is that between consumption in the ordinary sense, consumption 
necessitating the reproduction of things, and the space of production, 
which is traversed, and hence used and consumed, by flows; it is 
also the movement between the space of production and the space 
of reproduction, controlled by state power and underpinned by the 
reproducibi l ity of things in space, as of space itsel f, which is broken up 
in order co faci l i ta te chis. Under neocapital ism or corporate capitalism 
institutional space answers co the principles of repetition and reproduc­
ib i l ity - principles effectively h idden by semblances of creativity. This 
bureaucratic space, however, is at loggerheads with its own determinants 
and its own effects : though occupied by, control led by, and oriented 
towards the reproducible, it finds itself surrounded by the non-reproduc_' 



CONTRA D I CT I O N S  OF SPACE TO D I HERENTI A L  SPACE 355 

ible - by nature, by specific locations, by the local, the regional , the 
national ,  and even the worldwide. 

III 

Where then is the principal contradiction to be found ? Between the 
capacity to conceive of and treat space on a global (or worldwide) sca le 
on the one hand, and i ts fragmentation by a mult ipl icity of procedures or 
processes, a l l  fragmentary themselves, on the other.  Taking the broadest 
possible view, we find mathematics, logic and strategy, which make it 
possible to represent instrumental space, with its homogeneous - or 
better, homogenizing - character. This fetishized space, elevated to the 
rank of mental space by epistemology, impl ies and embodies an ideology 
- that of the primacy of abstract unity. Not that this makes fragmen­
tation any less 'operational ' .  I t  is  reinforced not only by administrative 
subdivision, not only by scientific and technical specialization, but also 
- indeed most of all - by the retail sel l ing of space ( in lots ) .  

I f  one needed convincing of the  existence of this contradiction, i t  
would suffice to th ink,  on the one hand, of the pulverizing tendency of 
fragmented space and,  on the other, of a computer science that  can 
dominate space in such a fashion that a computer - hooked up if need 
be to other image- and document-reproducing equipment - can assemble 
an indeterminate mass of information relating to a given physical or 
social space and process i t  a t  a single location, virtually a t  a single point. 

To present the homogeneous/fractured character of space as a binary 
relationship (as a simple contrast o r  confrontation) is to betray i ts truly 
dual nature. I t  is impossible to overemphasize either the mutual 
inherence or the contradictoriness of these two aspects of space. Under 
its homogeneous aspect, space abolishes distinctions and differences, 
among them that between inside and outside, which tends to be reduced 
to the undifferentiated state of the visible-readable realm .  Simul­
taneously, this same space is  fragmented and fractured, in accordance 
with the demands of the division of labour and of  the division of needs 
and functions, until a th reshold of tolerabi l i ty is  reached or even passed 
( in terms of exiguity of volumes, absence of l inks, and so on ) .  The ways 
in which space is thus carved up are remin iscent of the ways in which 
�he body is cut into pieces in images (especial ly the female body, which 
i,s not only cut up but also deemed to be 'without organs' ! ) .  

I t  is not, therefore, a s  though one had global (or conceived) space to 
2ne side and fragmented (or directly experienced) space to the other -



356 CONT R A D I CTI O N S  O F  SPACE T O  D I FFERENT I A L  SPACE 
rather as one might have an intact glass here and a broken glass or 
mi rror over there. For space 'is' whole and broken , global and fractu red, 
at one and the same time. Just as it is at once conceived, perceived, and 
di rectly l ived. 

The contradiction between the global and the subdiv ided subsumes 
the contradiction between centre and periphery ; the second defines the 
internal movement of the first. Effective globalism implies an established 
centra l i ty .  The concentration of 'everyth ing' that exists in space subordi­
nates al l  spatial elements and moments to the power that controls the 
centre. Compactness and density are a 'property' of centres ; radiating 
out from centres, each space, each spatial interval ,  is a vector of con­
straints and a bearer of norms and 'val ues ' .  

IV 

The opposition between exchange value and use value, though it begins 
as a mere contrast or non-dialectical antithesis, eventual ly assumes a 
dia lectical character. Attempts to show that exchange absorbs use are 
real ly j ust an incomplete way of replacing a static opposition by a 
dynamic one. The fact is that use re-emerges sharply at odds with 
exchange in space, for it impl ies not 'property' but 'appropriation'. 
Appropriation itself impl ies time (or times) ,  rhythm (or rhythms), sym­
bols, and a practice. The more space is functional ized - the more 
completely it fa l l s  under the sway of those 'agents' that have manipulated 
it so as to render it unifunctional - the less susceptible it becomes to 
appropriation. Why ?  Because in this way it is removed from the sphere 
of lived time, from the time of i ts 'users ' ,  which is a diverse and complex 
time. Al l  the same, what is it that a buyer acquires when he purchases 
a space ? The answer is time. 

Thus everyday l ife cannot be understood without understanding the 
contradiction between use and exchange (use va lue and exchange value). 
I t  i s  the political use of space, however, that does the most to reinstate 
use value; it does this in terms of resources, spatial situations, and 
strategies. 

Is a system of knowledge - a science - of the use of space l ikely to 
evolve out of such considerations ? Perhaps - but i t  would have tO 
involve an analysis of rhythms, and an effective critique of representative 
and normative spaces. Might such a knowledge legitimately be given a 
name - that of 'spatia l  analysis' , for example? That would be reasonable 



CONTR A D I CT I O N S  OF SPACE TO DI FFERENTIAL SPACE 357 

enough - but  one  is loth indeed to  add ye t  another specia l ization to 
what is a l ready a very long l i st. 

v 

The principal contradiction identtfied above corresponds to the contra­
diction discerned by Marx, at the very beginning of his ana lysis of 
capita l ism, between the forces of  production and the socia l  rel ations of 
production (and of property ) .  Though blunted now at the level of the 
production of things (in space) ,  at a higher level - that of the production 
of space - this contradiction is becoming ever more acute. Technical ly,  
scientifical ly, formerly undreamt-of possib i l ities have opened up.  A 
'society' other than ours cou ld undoubtedly invent, create or 'produce' 
new forms of  space on th is basis. Existing property and production 
relations erase these prospects, however ;  in other words, they shatter 
conceptions of space that tend to form in dreams, in imaginings, in 
utopias or in science fiction. Practical ly  speaking, the possibi l i ties are 
always systematical ly reduced to the triteness of what a l ready exists -
to houses in the suburbs or h igh-rises ( individual boxes sprinkled with 
a few i l lusions versus hundreds of  boxes stacked one on top of  another ) .  

These are very fundamental points, but the fact that  they are  so 
fundamental cannot be too often reiterated, because Marx's thinking 
tends to be weakened and diverted by a l l  kinds of polit ical attitudes . 
There are those who want a 'socia l ism' in the industria l ized countries 
that would s imply continue along the path of growth and accumulation 
- the path, in other words, of the production of  th ings in space. Others 
would smash every single mechanism of the cu rrent mode of production 
for the sake of  an 'extremist' revolutionary activism or ' leftism' .  The 
appeal of the first group is to 'object ivity' ,  that of the second to 'voluntar­
. ism' (subjectivity) .  

By furthering the development of  the forces of production, the bour­
geoisie played a revolutionary role. It was Marx's view - and to overlook 
this point is to misunderstand his whole thinking - that the advent of 
large-scale industry, a long with scientific and technological advance, 
had shaken the world to its foundations. The productive forces have 
since taken another great leap - from the production of things in space 
(o the production of space. Revolut ionary activ i ty ought, among other 
�h-ings, to fol low this qualitative leap - which also constitutes a leap 
into the qualitative - to i ts u l timate consequences. This means putting 
the process of purely quantitative growth into question - not so much 



CONTR A D I CTIONS Of SPACE TO D I FFERENT I A L  S P A C E  

in order to arrest it as to identify its potentia l .  The conscious production 
of space has 'a lmost' been achieved. But the threshold cannot be crossed 
so long as that  new mode of production is pre-empted by the sel l ing of 
space parcel by parcel, by a mere travesty of a new space. 

VI 

The violence that is inherent in space enters into conflict with knowledge, 
which is equal ly inherent in that space. Power - which is to say violence 
- divides, then keeps what it has divided in a state of separation ; 
inversely, it reunites - yet keeps whatever it wants in a state of confusion. 
Thus knowledge reposes on the effects of power and treats them as 
' real ' ; in other words, it endorses them exactly as they are .  Nowhere is 
the confrontation between knowledge and power, between understand­
ing and violence, more direct than it is in connection with intact space 
and space broken up .  In the dominated sphere, constraints and violence 
are encountered at every turn : they are everywhere. As for power, it 
too is omnipresent. 
.. Dominated space rea l izes mil i tary and political (strategic) 'models' in 
the field. There i s  more to i t  than th is, however, for thanks to the 
operation of power practical space is the bearer of norms and con­
straints. It does not merely express power - it proceeds to repress in 
the name of power (and sometimes even in the name of nothing) . As a 
body of constraints, stipulations and rules to be fol lowed, social space 
acquires a normative and repressive efficacy - l inked instrumentally 
to its objectality - that makes the efficacy of mere ideologies and 
representations pale in comparison.  It is an essentia l ly deceptive space, 
readi ly occupiable by pretences such as those of civic peace, consensus, 
or the reign of non-violence.  Not that this space - dominating as well 
as dominated - is not inhabited as well by the agencies of the Law, of 
the Father, or of Genital ity. Logic and logistics conceal its latent violence, 
which to be effective does not even have to show its hand. \ 

Spatial practice regulates l i fe - it does not create it . Space has no 
power ' in  itse l f' ,  nor does space as such determine spatial contradictions. 
These are contradictions of society - contradictions between one thing 
and another within society, as for example between the forces and 
relations of production - that simply emerge in space, at the level of 
space, and so engender the contradictions of space.

VII 

The contradictions identified in the foregoing discussion have been 
presented in  a concepcual and theoretical manner which may suggest 
that they are abstractions unrelated to plain facts, to the empirical 
realm. Nothing could be further from the truth . These formulations do 
correspond to facts - indeed, they are the disti l lation of an indeterminate 
number of experiences. The contradictions in question are readily verifi­
able :  even the most fanatical of positivists could detect them with the 
naked eye. I t  is j ust that empiricism refuses to call them 'contradictions', 
preferring to speak only of inconsistencies or of 'dysfunctions' ; the 
empiricist j ibs at giving theoretica l form to his observations, and confines 
himself to arranging his data into sets of logical ly connected facts. 

Owners of private cars have a space at  their disposition that costs 
the�-Yerf lltlle personal ly, a l though society col lectively pays a very h igh 
price for i ts maintenance.This arrangement causes the number of cars 
(and car-owners) to increase, which suits the car-manufacturers j ust fine, 
and strengthens their hand in their constant efforts to have this space 
expanded. The productive consumption of space - which is productive, 
above all, of surplus value - receives much subsidization and enormous 
loans from government. This is just another way of barring all escape 
from a cruel spiral which optimists l ike to refer to as a ' regulatory 
system' ; such 'systems' unquestionably play a 'self-regulating' role for 
society - provided that society is prepared to accept the side-effects. 
Enough said. As for 'green areas' - trees, squares that are anything more 
than intersections, town parks - these obviously give pleasure to the 
community as a whole, but who pays for this pleasure ? How and from 
whom can fees be collected ? Since such spaces serve no one in particular 
(though they do br ing enjoyment to people in general ) ,  there is a 
tendency for them to die out. Non-productive consumption attracts no 
investment because all i t  produces is pleasure. Colossal sums, meanwhile, 
are invested in the most unproductive consumption imaginable :  namely, 
the consumption of arms of al l  kinds, including rockets and missi les . 

There are two w�in which uEl?an sp_£1ce te�d_s to be s l iced up, 
degraded and eventual ly destroyed by this contradictory process-:-"tne 
proliferation of fast roads and of p laces to park and garage cars, and 
.their corol lary, a reduction of tree- l ined streets, green spaces, and parks 
and gardens. The contradiction lies, then, in the clash between a con­
sumption of space which produces surplus value and one which produces 
gnly enjoyment - and is therefore 'unproductive ' .  It is a clash, in 



3 60 C O NT R A D I CTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTIA L  SPACE 
other words, between capitalist 'ut i l izers' and community 'users ' .  (This 
account owes much to Alfred Sauvy - one of those who appears to see 
no contradictions here. 1 )  

VIII 

Cases are legion where the empirical approach to a given process refuses 
to carry its description to a conceptua l  level where a dia lectical 
(conflictua l )  dynamic is l ikely to emerge. For example, countries in the 
throes of rapid development blithely destroy h istoric spaces - houses, 
palaces, mi l i tary or civil structures. If advantage or profit is to be found 
in it, then the old is swept away. Later, however, perhaps towards the 
end of the period of accelerated growth, these same countries are l iable 
to discover how such spaces may be pressed into the service of cul tural 
consumption, of 'culture itself', and of the tourism and the leisure 
industries with their a lmost l imitless prospects. When this happens, 
everything that they had so merri ly demolished during the belle epoque is 
reconstituted at great expense. Where destruction has not been complete, 
'renovation' becomes the order of the day, or im itation, or replication, 
or neo-this or neo-that. In any case, what had been annihi lated in the 
earl ier frenzy of growth now becomes an object of adoration. And 
former objects of uti l ity now pass for rare and precious works of art. 

Let us for a moment consider the space of arch i tecture and of archi­
tects, without attaching undue importance to what is said about this 
space .  It is easy to imagine that the architect has before him a sl ice or 
piece of  space cut from larger wholes, that he takes this portion of space 
as a 'given' and works on it according to his tastes, technical skills, 
ideas and preferences. In short, he receives his  assignment and deals 
with it in complete freedom . 

That is not what actual ly happens, however. The section of space 
assigned to the architect - perhaps by 'developers ' ,  perhaps by govern­
ment agencies - is a ffected by calculations that he may have some 
int imation of but with which he is certainly not well acquainted. This 
space has nothing innocent about it :  it answers to particular tactics 
and strategies ; it is, qui te simply, the space of the dominant mode of 
production, and hence the space of capita lism, governed by the bour· 
geoisie. It consists of ' lots' and is organized in a repressive manner as 
a function of the important fea tures of the local i ty .

CONTRA DICTIONS OF SPACE TO D I F FERENT I A L  SPACE 361  

As  for the eye of the architect, it is no  more innocent than the lot h e  
i s  given to  bui ld on  or the blank sheet of paper on  which he makes his 
first sketch . His 'subjective' space is freighted with a l l -coo-objective 
meanings. It is a visual space, a space reduced to blueprints, to mere 
images - to that 'world of the image' which is the enemy of the 
imagination. These reductions are accentuated and justified by the rule 
of l inear perspective. Such steri l izing tendencies were denounced long 
ago by Gromort, who demonstrated how they served to fetishize the 
fa(fade - a volume made up of planes and lent spurious depth by means 
of decorative motifs .  2 The tendency to make reductions of this kind -
reductions to parcels, to images, to fa<;ades that are made to be seen 
and co be seen from ( thus reinforcing 'pure' visual space) - is a tendency 
that degrades space. The fa(fade ( to see and to be seen) was a lways a 
measure of socia l  standing and prestige. A prison with a fa<;ade - which 
was also the prison of the family - became the epitome and modular 
form of bourgeoisified space. 

It may thus be said of architectural discourse that it too often imitates 
or caricatures the discourse of power, and that it suffers from the 
delusion that 'objective' knowledge of ' real ity '  can be attained by means 
of graphic representations. This discourse no longer has any frame of 
reference or  horizon. I t  only too easily becomes - as in the case of Le 
Corbusier - a moral discourse on straight l ines, on right angles and 
straightness in genera l ,  combining a figurative appeal co nature (water, 
air, sunshine) with the worst kind of abstraction (plane geometry, mod­
ules, etc. ) .  

Within t h e  spatial practice of modern society, the arch itect ensconces 
himself in his own space. He has a representation of this space, one 
which is bound to graphic elements - to sheets of paper, plans, elev­
ations, sections, perspective views of fa(fades, modules, and so on. This 
conceived space is thought by chose who make use of it to be true, 
despite the fact - or perhaps because of the fact - that it is geometrical : 
because it is a medium for objects, an object i tsel f, and a locus of the 
objectification of plans. Its distant ancestor is the l inear perspective 
developed as early as the Renaissance : a fixed observer, an immobile 
perceptual field, a stable visual world .  The chief criterion of the architec­
tural plan, which is 'unconsciously' determined by this perceptual field, 
is whether or not i t  is real izable: the plan is projected onto the field of 
architectural thought, there to be accepted or rejected. A vase number

of representations (some would call them ' ideological ' representations, 
but why bother with a term now so devalued by misuse ? )  take this 
route ; any plan, to merit consideration, must be quantifiable, profitable, 
communicable and ' real istic ' .  Set aside or downplayed from the outset 
are all questions relating to what is too close or too distant, relating to 
the surroundings or 'environment', and relating to the relationship 
between private and public. On the other hand, subdiv isions ( lots) and 
specia l izations ( functional localizations) are quite admissible to this 
practica l ly defined sphere. Much more than this, in fact: though the 
sphere in question seems passive with respect to operations of this kind, 
its very passive acceptance of them ensures the ir  operational impact. 
The division of labour, the division of needs and the division of objects 
(things) ,  a l l  local ized, a l l  pushed to the point of maximum separation 
of functions, people and things, are perfectly at home in th is spatial 
field, no matter that it appears to be neutral and objective, no matter 
that it is apparently the repository of knowledge, sans peur et sans 
reproche. 

Let us now turn our attention to the space of those who are referred 
to by means of such clumsy and pejorative labels as 'users' and ' inhabi­
tants' . No well-defined terms with clear connotations have been found 
to designate these groups. Their marginal ization by spatial practice thus 
extends even to language. The word ' user' (usager), for example, has 
something vague - and vaguely suspect - about it. 'User of what ? '  one 
tends to wonder. Clothes and cars are used (and wear out), just as 
houses are. But what is use value when set alongside exchange and its 
corol laries ? As for ' inhabitants ' ,  the word designates everyone - and no 
one. The fact is that the most basic demands of 'users' (suggesting 
'underprivileged') and ' inhabitants' (suggesting 'marginal ' )  find 
expression only with great difficulty, whereas the signs of their situation 
are constantly increasing and often stare us in the face. 

The user's space is lived - not represented (or conceived) .  When 
compared with the abstract space of the experts (architects, urbanists, 
p lanners), the space of the everyday activities of users is a concrete one, 
which is to �ay, subjective. As a space of 'subjects' rather than of 
calcu lations, as a representational space, it has an origin, and that origin 
is chi ldhood, with its hardships, its achievements, and its lacks. Lived 
space bears the stamp of the conflict between an inevitable, if long and 
difficult, maturation process and a fa i lure to mature that leaves particu­
lar  original  resources and reserves untouched . I t  is in this space that the 
'private' rea lm asserts i tsel f, albeit more or less vigorously, and always 
in a confl ictua l  way, against the public one. 



CONTRAl)(CTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTI A L  SPACE 363 

It is possible, nevertheless, i f  on ly  in a mediational or transitional 
way, to form a menta l picture of a primacy of concrete spaces -
of semi-public, semi-private spaces, of meeting-places, pathways and 
passageways. Th is would mean the diversification of space, while the 
(relative) importance attached to functional distinctions would disap­
pear. Appropriated places would be fixed, semi-fixed, movable or vac­
ant. We should not forget that among the contradictions here a not 
unimportant part is played by the contradiction between the ephemeral 
and the stable (or, to use Heidegger's phi losophical terminology, between 
Dwell ing and Wandering) . Although work - including a portion of 
household production ( food preparation, etc. ) - demands a fixed 
location, this is not true of sleep, nor of play, and in this respect the 
West might do wel l  to take lessons from the East, with its great open 
spaces, and its low and easi ly movable furniture. 

In the West the reign of the fa«ade over space is certainly not over. 
The furniture, which is a lmost as heavy as the bui ldings themselves, 
continues to have fa«ades ; mirrored wardrobes, sideboards and chests 
stil l  face out onto the sphere of private l i fe, and so help dominate it .  
Any mobilization of 'private' l i fe would be accompanied by a restoration 
of the body, and the contradictions of space would have to be brought 
out into the open.  Inasmuch as the resulting space would be inhabited 
by subjects, it might legitimately be deemed 'situational '  or ' relationa l '  
- but these definitions or determinants would refer to  sociological 
content rather than to any intrinsic properties of space as such . 

The restoration of the body means, first and foremost, the restoration 
of the sensory-sensual - of speech, of the voice, of smel l ,  of hearing. 
In short, of the non-visua l .  And of the sexual - though not in the sense 
of sex considered in  isolation, but rather in the sense of  a sexual energy 
directed towards a specific discharge and flowing according to specific 
rhythms. 

But these are no more than suggestions, or pointers . 

IX 

One of the most glaring paradoxes about abstract space is the fact that 
it can be at once the whole set of locations where contradictions are 
generated, the medium in which those contradictions evolve and which 
they tear apart, and, lastly, the means whereby they are smothered and 
�eplaced by an appearance of consistency. This gives space a function,

filled by ideology, and which is sti l l  to some extent felt to require an 
ideology. 

As long ago as 1 96 1 ,  Jane J acobs examined the fa i lures of 'city­
planning and rebui lding' in the United States. In particular, she showed 
how the destruction of streets and neighbourhoods led to the disappear­
ance of many acquired characteristics of city l i fe - or, rather, character­
istics assumed to have been permanently acquired : security, social con­
tact, faci l i ty of chi ld-rearing, diversity of relationships, and so on.3 
Jacobs did not go so far as flatly to incriminate neocapital ism, or as to 
isolate the contradictions immanent to the space produced by capitalism 
(abstract space ) .  But she did very forcefu l ly  demonstrate how destructive 
this space can be, and specifically how urban space, using the very 
means apparently intended to create or re-create it, effects its own self­
destruction .  

Faced with the  city 's  complexity and  unintel l igibi l ity (whether real  or 
merely apparent is of no consequence here) ,  some in the United States 
were inspired to take the practical and theoretical initiative of creating 
specia lists responsible for disentangling the web of problems and 
expla ining them, though without necessarily proposing solutions .  Such 
was the init ial agenda of so-called 'advocacy planning', as opposed to 
the 'city-planning' of the authorities. The notion was that in this way 
'users' and ' inhabitants', as a group, would secu re the services of some­
one competent, capable of speaking and communicating - in short, an 
advocate - who would negotiate for them with political or financial 
entities. 

The fai lure of this approach, as documented by Goodman, is rich in 
meaning.4 When the interested parties - the 'users' - do not speak up, 
who can speak in their name or in their place ? Certain ly not some 
expert, some special ist of space or of spokesmanship; there is no such 
specia l ization, because no one has a right to speak for those directly 
concerned here. The entitlement to do so, the concepts to do so, the 
language to do so are simply l acking. How would the discourse of such 
an expert differ from that of the archi tects, 'developers' or pol i ticians?

The fact is chat to accept such a role or function is to espouse the 
fetish ization of communication - the replacement of use by exchange. 
The si lence of the 'users' is indeed a problem - and it  is  the entire 
problem . The expert either works for himself alone or else he serves the 
interests of bureaucratic, financial or polit ical forces . I f  ever he were 
truly to confront these forces in the name of the interested parties, his 
fate would be sealed. 

One of the deepest confl icts immanent to space is that space as 
actual ly 'experienced' prohibits the expression of conflicts. For confl icts 
to be voiced, they must first be perceived, and this without subscribing 
to representations of space as general ly conceived. A theory is therefore 
called for, one which would transcend representational space on the one 
hand and representations of space on the other, and which would be 
able properly to articu l ate contradictions (and in the first place the 
contradiction between these two aspects of representation ) .  Socio-pol iti­
cal contrad ictions are real ized spatia l ly .  The contradictions of space thus 
make the contradictions of socia l  relations operative. In other words, 
spatial contradictions 'express' conflicts between socio-pol itical interests 
and forces ; it is only in space that such conflicts come effectively into 
play, and in so doing they become contradictions of space. 

x 

The aforementioned contradiction between the global (the capacity to 
conceive of and dea l with space on a wide scale, even on a world scale, 
as in the cases of computer science and the geopoli tics of a ir  transport) 
and the fragmentary ( the subdivision of space for purposes of buying 
and sel l ing) intensifies at  the strategic level. In  strategic spaces resources 
are always localized. Estimates are made in terms of units, whether units 
of production (firms) or units of consumption (households) .  Objectives 
and 'targets', by contrast, are a lways globalizing in tendency, and effec­
tively worldwide in the case of the chief states and chief transnationa l  
corporations. Dispersion and  subdivision, often carried to  the point o f  
complete segregation, are controlled and  dominated by  strategic aims, 
by. wills-to-power of the h ighest order in terms both of the quantity of 
means employed and of the qual i ty of goals  pursued. Everything that is 
<lispersed and fragmented reta ins its unity, however, within the hom­
O'geneity of power's space ;  this is a space which naturally takes account 
of -the connections and l inks between those elements that it keeps, 



366 CONTR A D ICT I O N S  O F  S P A C E  T O  D l f fER ENTIAL SPACE 
paradoxical ly ,  un i ted yet- disunited, joined yet detached from one 
another, at once torn apart and squeezed together. 

It would be mistaken in this connection to picture a hierarchical scale 
stretching between two poles, with the unified will of political power 
at one extreme and the actual dispersion of differentiated elements at 
the other. For everything (the 'whole ' )  weighs down on the lower or 
'micro ' level, on the local and the local izable - in short, on the sphere 
of everyday l ife .  Everyth ing (the 'whole') a lso depends on this leve l :  
exploitation and domination, protection and - inseparably - repression.  
The basis and foundation of the 'whole' is dissociation and separation, 
mainta ined as such by the wil l above; such dissociation and separation 
are inevitable in that they are the outcome of a history, of the history 
of accumulation, but they are fatal as soon as they are maintained in 
this way, because they keep the moments and elements of social practice 
away from one another. A spatial practice destroys social practice ; social 
practice destroys itse l f  by means of spatial practice. 

At the strategic level, forces in contention occupy space and generate 
pressures, actions, events. The law of interpenetration of smal l move­
ments does not obtain at this level .  

This does not mean that the 'micro' level is any less significant. 
Though it may not supply the theatre of conflict or the sphere in which 
contending forces are deployed, it does contain both the resources 
needed and the stakes at issue. The goal of any strategy is sti l l ,  as it 
a lways has been, the occupation of a space by the varied means of 
poli tics and of war. 

A variety of conceptual grids may be developed to help decipher 
complex spaces. The broadest of these distinguishes between types of 
oppositions and contrasts in space: isotopias, or analogous spaces; 
heterotopias, or mutual ly repellent spaces ; and utopias, or spaces occu­
pied by the symbolic and the imaginary - by ' idealities' such as nature, 
absolute knowledge or absolute power. Though this classification is sti l l 
rather crude, i t  does bring out a paradox - a contradiction not hitherto 
noticed : namely, the fact that the most effectively appropriated spaces 
are those occupied by symbols. Gardens and parks, which symbolize an 
absolute nature, are an example; or religious bui ldings, which symbolize 
power and wisdom - and hence the Absolute pure and simple. 

A suppler and more concrete grid classifies places according to their 
attributions - private, public or mediational (passageways or pathways) 
- or, in other words, according to their use and their users . 

A third type of grid would operate at the strategic level, and reveal 
the measure of order that exists beneath the chaotic surface of space : _  



C O NTR AD I CTI O N S  OF SPACE TO DIFFERENTI A L  SPACE 367 

the articulations between the market in space and the spaces of the 
market, between spatial planning and development and the productive 
forces occupying space, and between political projects and the obstacles 
they run into - that is to say, those forces that run counter to a given 
strategy and occasional ly succeed in  establishing a 'counter-space' with in  
a particular space. 

Why, then, should we not simply pursue this l ine of enquiry further, 
in the hope of arriving at a completely satisfactory grid ?  Two points 
are worth making by way of response to this question. First, there i s  
no good reason for l imiting the number of possible grids, or to deem 
one preferable in some absolute way to another. Secondly, the concept 
of the grid, l ike the concepts of the model and the code, is itself not 
above reproach. As tools of formal knowledge, all such concepts have 
a precise aim, which is to el iminate contradictions, to demonstrate a 
coherence, and to reduce the dialectical to the logical .  Such an intent i s  
immanent to a knowledge that  aspires to be 'pure' and 'absolute' while 
remaining ignorant of its own raison d'etre - which is to reduce reality 
in the interests of power. 

XI 

It is possible, on the basis of a particu lar knowledge - that of the 
production of space - to entertain the idea of a science of social space 
(a space both urban and rural, but predominantly rura l ) .  

What term would be  most appropriate here ? Connaissance? 'Science' ? 
Or savoir?5 I have used the term savoir above with an unfavourable 
connotation . This was not to suggest, however, that the term designates 
a knowledge now obsolete, relegated to hisrory - gathering dust on the 
shelf alongside other outdated contributions. This use of the term is a 
little suspect, in any case, because there is an element of the arbitrary 
about it :  anyone, after a l l ,  is free to decide what to file under outdated 
knowledge or received wisdom. 

The negative connotation that I feel we are j ustified in attaching to 
:savoir is the suggestion that such knowledge col ludes to some degree 
with power, that it i s  bound up, whether crudely or more subtly, with 
political practice - and hence with the multifarious representations and 

" 'rhetoric of ideology.

As for connaissance, knowledge in th is sense at all times embodies 
both a self-criticism which relativizes it, and a critique of what exists, 
which natural ly becomes more acute when political stakes (or politics 
at stake) and strategies are under scrutiny.  Connaissance seeks to grasp 
the global .  In this respect i t  is l inked to phi losophy, of which it is an 
extension, even though it makes common cause with socia l  practice by 
virtue of its attachment to a specific, sal ient concept - the concept of 
production. We have now in effect defined metaphilosophy, which is 
grounded in phi losophy but which opens phi losophy up to the ' real' 
and the possible. 

When the crit ical moment occurs, connaissance generates the concrete 
universal. The concepts necessary (among them that of production) are 
not sufficient unto themselves: they lead back to the practice that they 
hold up to view. When appl ied to such concepts, certa in questions lose 
their val idity :  questions concerning either a specified subject (who is 
th inking? who i s  speaking? where is that person speaking from? )  or an 
identifiable object (what space does it occupy ? upon what site is it 
located ? ) .  I t  is not j ust by virtue of their content, but, j ust as importantly, 
by virtue of the theoretical form just described - that is, the l ink with 
l ived experience, with practice, and with a radical critique - that these 
concepts a re exempted from such questions. 

The word 'science' continues to imply a detailed process of working­
out and construction confined to a specified field and ca l l ing for strict 
adherence to predetermined methods. The resul t  is scepticism towards 
al l  special ist dogmas, and notably towards the methods - the operational 
(or supposedly operational )  concepts - used by particula r  special izations. 

The science of space should therefore be viewed as a science of use, 
whereas the specia l ized sciences known as socia l  sciences ( including, for 
example, political economy, sociology, semiology and computer science) 
partake of exchange, and aspire to be sciences of exchange - that is, of 
communication and of the communicable. In this capacity, the science 
of space would concern itself with the material , sensory and natural 
realms, though with regard to nature its emphasis would be on what 
we have been cal l ing a 'second nature' : the city ,  urban l i fe, and social 
energetics - considerations ignored by the simplistic nature-centred 
approaches with their ambiguous concepts such as the 'environment' . 
The tendency of such a science would run counter to the dominant 
(and dominating) tendency in another respect also: it would accord 
appropriation a specia l  p ractical and theoretical status. For appropri­
ation and for use, therefore - and against exchange and domination. 

Co-optation, as a l ready mentioned, should be looked upon as a 



CONTRADICTIONS OF SPACE TO D I F FERENTIAL SPACE 369 

practice in termediate between domination and appropriation, between 
exchange and use. To oppose i t  to production or to treat it as exclusive 
of production is to mistake its character. Properly understood, co­
optation can lead to the production of a space. There are i l lustrious 
precedents for this . Consider, for example, Christianity's co-optation of 
the Roman basi l ica. Original ly intended for a secu lar, civic and social 
function, as a place of encounter and of 'commerce' in the broadest 
sense of the word, this bui ld ing was given a rel igious and political role ;  
its transformation went hand in hand with its consecration, with i ts 
subordination to cryptal constraints and requirements. The adjoining 
areas of crypt and tombs slowly but surely gave it the form of the cross; 
the day would come when this form would give birth, in the light of 
the Word ( the Logos resurrected ) ,  to the soaring upsurge of the Middle 
Ages. As for the structure itself, i t  underwent modifications that had no 
logical connection with those suffered by the function and the form. 
The invention of intersecting r ibs was a turning-point, as everyone 
knows. 

The form corresponds approximately to the moment of communi­
cation - hence to the realm of the perceived. The function is carried 
out, effectively or not, and corresponds to the directly experienced in 
a representational space. The structure is conceived, and implies a 
representation of space. The whole is located within a spatial practice. 
It would be inexact and reductionistic to define use solely in terms of 
function, as functional ism recommends. Form - the communicable, 
·communication - is also an aspect of use, as is structure, which is a lways 
the structure of  an  object that we make use of and use up. Each time 
one of these categories is employed independently of the others, hence 
reductively, it serves some homogenizing strategy. Formalism puts a l l  
the emphasis on form, and thus on communicabi l i ty and exchange. 
Functional ism stresses function to the point where, because each function 
has a special ly assigned place within dominated space, the very possi­
,bility of mult ifunctional i ty is e l iminated. And structuralism takes into 
:account only structures, treating them as objects which are i n  the 
· last analysis technological in character. The fact is, however, that use 

. rcorresponds to a unity and col laboration between the very factors that 
such dogmatisms insist on dissociating. 

Needless to say, no plan could conceivably maintain a perfect balance 
ibetween these diverse moments or ' formants' of space. A given plan 
:must of necessity highlight  either function, or form, or structure. But 
;the way that one or another of these moments or formants is brought 
i�to play to begin with does not imply the demise of the other two. On 



3 70 CONTRADICTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTIAL SPACE 

the contrary, considering that what appears first wil l later become mere 
appearance, the prospect is that the other moments wil l  consequently 
become more ' real '  in comparison . Herein, i t  would seem, lies the genius 
of  art in the classical sense - an art which, though outdated as such, 
needs to be resumed and extended much as thought needs to resume 
and extend phi losophy. 

The initial analysis of a musical work has three moments or aspects : 
rhythm, melody, harmony. This tridimensional i ty ensu res the possibi l i ty 
of endless production, even though the possibi lities of each moment 
considered in isolation,  or of each binary opposition, are finite. Works 
constructed around just one of these moments ( for instance, around 
melody or percussion alone) are more readily communicable, but at the 
same time they are monotonous and unattractive. The great classical 
music maintained unity between the three moments: each player or 
work concentrates upon and accentuates one or another, only to bring 
the others into prominence sooner or later. This variation of effects is 
a lso to be found within a single composition, within a single sonata or 
symphony. The role of emphasis here, so far from being a homogenizing 
one, so far from serving to overwhelm al l  other possible aspects of the 
work, is simply to point up qual ities and underscore differences. The 
result is movement instead of stagnation, as one moment always refers 
to the next, which it prepares for and informs. The simultaneous pres­
ence of materials (piano, strings, brass, etc. ) and materiel (scales, modes, 
tones) opens up possibi l i ties and amplifies differences, thus reversing the 
reductionist tendency, which is itse l f  associated with the ideology of 
exchange and communication. 

XII 

Abstract space, which is the tool of domination, asphyxiates whatever 
is conceived with in it and then strives to emerge. Though it is not a 
defining characteristic of abstract space, there is nevertheless nothing 
secondary or fortuitous about this proclivity. This space is a lethal one 
which destroys the historical conditions that gave rise to it, its own 
( interna l )  differences, and any such differences that show signs of 
developing, in order to impose an abstract homogeneity .  The negativity 
that Hegel ianism attributed to historical temporal i ty alone is in fact 
characteristic of abstract space, and this in a double sense, or, rather, 
operating with redoubled force: it stands opposed to al l  difference 
whether actual  or potentia l .  Why has this letha l  power been unleashed ? 



CONTRADICTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENT I A L  SPACE 37 1  

Is i t  related to  the nuclear threat ?  To freewheel ing technology ? To 
rampant population growth ? To the kind of development known to be 
undesirable yet desired by power? To ecological problems ? Or, more 
obscurely, to the operation of abyssal forces or of self-destructive tend­
encies in the species or in  the planet, to the operation of a death instinct? 

But, then, how important is it that a cause or reason be found here ? 
Granted, an answer would gratify the phi losophers' age-old speculative 
instinct; the l ast remaining members of that species could focus their 
attention and interest on an ontological ly privileged and i l luminating 
area, and contemplate a supreme Cause or Reason - no longer for 
Being, but rather for Non-Being. 

Would i t  not make more sense, however, instead of striving to discover 
the metaphysical source of the death sentence passed on itsel f by the 
'world '  - i.e. the Judaeo-Christian, Graeco-Roman world, 'overdetermi­
ned' by capita l ism - to examine the instrument used ? For neither the 
atomic bomb, nor the squandering of resources, nor demographic, econ­
omic or production-based growth - indeed, no single aspect of the threat 
- can define its instrument, which is space. All the above-mentioned 
causes or reasons converge in  space. Space harbours them, receives and 
transforms them into efficacious (operationa l )  agents. Space and space 
alone - instrumental space - with its specific effects and its strategic 
aims: the removal of every obstacle in the way of the total e l imination 
of what is different. 

At this level it becomes apparent just how necessary - and at the 
same time how inadequate - the theory of al ienation is. The l imitations 
of the concept of al ienation lie in  th is :  i t  is so true that it is completely 
uncontested. The state of  affairs we have been describing and analysing 
validates the theory of al ienation to the ful l  - but it also makes i t  seem 
utterly trivial .  Considering the weight of the threat and the level of 
terror hanging over us, pi l lorying e ither al ienation in general or particu­
lar varieties of a l ienation appears pointless in the extreme. The 'status' 
of the concept, or of l iberal (humanist) ideology, is simply not the real 
issue. 

XIII 

With regard to the difficult and sti l l  incomplete theory of di fference, 
·'there is no need to do any more here than touch on a few points. 

This theory covers the whole rea lm  of knowledge (connaissance) and 
:'.of thinking about knowledge. I ts range extends from the conceived to 



372 CONTRA D I CTI ONS OF SPACE TO DI F F E R ENTIAL SPACE 
the directly lived, which is to say from the concept without l i fe to l i fe 
without concepts. And from logic to the dialectic, l inking the two and 
placing itsel f at  their point of articu lation .  On the one hand it  overlaps 
with the theory of coherence, and hence of identity (u l timately, tautologi­
cal identity) ; on the other hand it overlaps with the theory of contradic­
tions (u lt imately, antagonistic contradictions) .  

Two inseparable distinctions have t o  b e  drawn in this connection: 
that between minimal and maximal differences, and that between 
induced and produced di fferences . The first of these distinctions belongs 
to logic, the second to the theory of dialectical movement. With in logico­
mathematical sets, the difference between one and one (the first one and 
the second one) is  strictly minimal: the second differs from the first only 
by virtue of the iteration that gives rise to it. By contrast, the difference 
between finite cardinal and ordinal numbers on the one hand and 
transfinite cardinal and ordinal numbers on the other is a maximal 
difference. An induced difference remains within a set or system gener­
ated according to a particular law. It is in fact constitutive of that set 
or system:  for example, in numerical sets, the di fference between the 
successive elements generated by iteration or recurrence. S imi larly : the 
diversity between vi l las in a suburb fil led with vi l las ;  or between different 
'community faci l i t ies' ; or, again, variations with in a particular fashion 
in dress, as stipulated by that fashion itsel f. By contrast, a produced 
difference presupposes the shattering of a system ; it is born of an 
explosion ; it emerges from the chasm opened up when a closed universe 
ruptures. To a large extent, the theory of the production of d ifferences 
is based on the theory of maximal differences : a given set gives rise, 
beyond its own boundaries, to another, completely di fferent set. Thus 
the set of whole numbers generates first the set of fractions, then the 
sets of ' incommensurables' and ' transcendentals' , and ult imately the set 
of transfinite numbers. As soon as logico-mathematical categories apply, 
production and induction in these senses come into play. Repetitions 
generate differences, but not a l l  differences a re equivalent. The qualitat­
ive arises from the quantitative - and v ice versa . 

Under the reign of h istorical time, differences induced within a given 
mode of production coexist at first with produced differences promoting 
the demise of that mode. A difference of the latter kind is not only 
produced - it is also productive. Thus those d ifferences with in medieval 
society that foreshadowed a new mode of production had themselves 
accumulated during the general process of accumulation; at last they. 
precipitated a tumultuous transition and eventual ly shattered existing 
societies and their mode of production. The classical theory of dialectical 



CONTRADICTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTI A L  SPACE 373 
development refers to this moment as a qual i tative leap long prepared 
for by gradual (quantitative) changes.6 This traditional view, however, 
has turned out to suffer from a number of shortcomings and lacunae, 
and i f  it is to be revived it must at the same time be given much more 
depth . 

One more point :  particularities are a function of primary nature, 
of sites, of resources. On the basis of their differences, unknown or 
misunderstood, they confront one another and clash with one another. 
Out of their struggles, which imply and compl icate class struggles as 
wel l  as confl icts between peoples and nations, there emerge differences 
properly so cal led. Drawing a clear dist inction between particulari ties 
and di fferences makes i t  possible to dispense with such confused and 
dangerous metaphors as speci ficity, authenticity,  and so on. 

The formal theory of difference opens of i tse l f  onto the unknown and 
the i l l -understood: onto rhythms, onto ci rcula tions of energy, onto the 
l ife of the body (where repeti tions and di fferences give rise to one 
another, harmonizing and disharmonizing in turn) .  

XIV 

Differences endure or arise on the margins of the homogenized realm, 
either in the form of resistances or in the form of external ities ( lateral ,  
heterotopical, heterologica l ) .  What is different is, to begin with, what 
is excluded: the edges of the city, shanty towns, the spaces of forbidden 
games, of guerri l l a  war, of war. Sooner or l ater, however, the existing 
centre and the forces of homogenization must seek to absorb all such 
differences, and they wil l  succeed if these retain a defensive posture and 
no counterattack is mounted from their s ide .  In the latter event, centra l i ty 
and normal i ty wi l l  be tested as to the l imits of their power to integrate, 
to recuperate, or to destroy whatever has transgressed. 

The vast shanty towns of Latin America ((ave/as, barrios, ranchos) 
manifest a socia l  l i fe far more intense than the bourgeois districts of the 
cities. This  socia l  l ife is transposed onto the level of urban morphology, 
but it only survives inasmuch as it fights in self-defence and goes on the 
attack in the course of class struggle in its modern forms. Thei r  poverty 
,notwithstanding, these districts sometimes so effectively order their space

- houses, walls, public spaces - as to elicit a nervous admiration. 
Appropriation of a remarkably high order is to be found here. The 
spontaneous architecture and planning ( 'wild' forms, according to a 
would-be elegant terminology) prove greatly superior to the organization 
of space by specialists who effectively translate the social order into 
territorial reality with or without direct orders from economic and 
political authorities. The result - on the ground - is an extraordinary 
spatial duality. And the duality in space itself creates the strong 
impression that there exists a duality of political power: an equilibrium 
so threatened that an explosion is inevitable - and in short order. 
This impression is nonetheless mistaken - a measure, precisely, of the 
repressive and assimilative capacity of the dominant space. The duality 
will persist, certainly; and, failing any reversal of the situation, domi­
nated space will simply be weakened. 'Duality' means contradiction and 
conflict; a conflict of this kind eventuates either in the emergence of 
unforeseen differences or in its own absorption, in which case only 
induced differences arise (i.e. differences internal to the dominant form 
of space). A conflictual duality, which is a transitional state between 
oppos1t1on (induced difference) and contradiction/transcendence 
(produced difference), cannot last forever; it can sustain itself, however, 
around an 'equilibrium' deemed optimal by a particular ideology. 

xv 

In the absence of any dialectical movement, a given logic (or, once again, 
a given strategy) may generate a space by generating a spiral or vicious 
circle (also deemed 'optimal' by ideology). A case in point is the spiral

y.a�R.e!'.:�· The production of space is carried out with 
the state 's intervention, and the state naturally acts in accordance with 
the aims of capita l ,  yet this production seems to answer solely to the 
rational requirements of  communication between the various parts of 
society, as to those of a growth consistent with the interests of al l  'users' .  
What actual ly h appens is that a vicious circle is set in train which for 
al l  its circularity is an i nvasive force serving dominant economic interests. 

XVI 

Each spatial strategy has several a ims:  as many aims as abstract space 
- manipulated and manipulative - has 'properties ' .  Strategic space makes 
it possible s imultaneously to force worrisome groups, the workers among 
others, out towards the periphery ; to make avai lable spaces near the 
centres scarcer, so increasing their value; to organize the centre as 
locus of decision, wealth, power and information ; to find a l l ies for the 
hegemonic class within the middle strata and within the 'e l i te' ; to plan 
production and flows from the spatial point of view; and so on. 

The space of this socia l  practice becomes a space that sorts - a space 
that classifies in  the service of a class. The strategy of classification 
distributes the various socia l  strata and classes (other than the one that 
exercises hegemony) across the available territory, keeping them separate 
and prohibit ing a l l  contacts - these being replaced by the signs (or 
images) of contact. Two crit ical remarks are called for in this connection. 
The first concerns a kind of  'knowledge' that legitimates th is strategy 
by treating it as an object of science. I refer to structural ism, which cites 
intellectual  reasons of a h igh order for its interest in a rrangements and 
classifications of the kind that we have been discussing; what it perceives 
here is intell igib i l i ty - the superior relationsh ip of  the (thinking) subject 
and the (constructed ) object. In th is respect (but not only in this respect) 
the ideology of structuralism, wearing the mantle of knowledge, serves 
power. The second point is that 'operational '  notions of arrangement 
or classification govern the whole of space, and apply as much to private 
as to public space, as much to furnishings as to overall spatial planning. 
Such notions clearly serve power by contributing to a global homogeniz­
ing trend. After a l l ,  it is the state - 'public' ,  and hence polit ical, authority 
- that does the arranging and classifying. Operationalism of this kind 
actual ly conflates 'public' space with the 'private' space of the hegemonic 

·cl ass, or fraction of a class, that in the last analysis retains and maintains 
: Private ownership of  the land and of the other means of production.  It

is therefore in appearance only that the 'private' sphere is organized 
according to the dictates of the 'publ ic' one. The inverse situation (the 
world upside down - and waiting to be set on its feet) is the one that 
actual l y prevai ls .  The whole of space is increasingly modelled after 
private enterprise, private property and the fami ly - after a reproduction 
of production relations paral le l ing biological reproduction and geni­
tal ity.

Mimesis has its role and function in this domination of space :  imitation 
and its corol laries; analogy, and impressions to a greater or lesser 
degree informed by analogy ; resemblances and dissimi lari ties ; metaphor 
(substitution of one term for another) and metonymy (use of a part to 
refer to the whole ) .  This role is a contradictory one, however: by 
assigning a model , which occupies a space, to an as-yet i l l -defined desire, 
imitation ensures that violence (or rather counter-violence) wil l be done 
to that desire in its rel ationship with that space and its occupant. With 
its components and variants, mimesis makes it possible to establish an 
abstract 'spatial ity' as a coherent system that is partly artificial and 
partly real .  Nature is imitated, for example, but only seemingly repro­
duced : what are produced are the signs of nature or of the natural realm 
- a tree, perhaps, or a shrub, or merely the image of a tree, or a 
photograph of one. In this way nature is effectively replaced by powerful 
and destructive abstractions without any production of 'second nature', 
without any appropriation of nature; nature is left, as it were, in a no­
man 's- land. An actualized 'second nature ' ,  fa r removed from nature 
proper yet concrete at its own level, wou ld be emancipated from artifice 
while at the same time reta ining no suggestion of the 'natural ' .  Mimesis, 
on the other hand, pitches its tent in an artificial world, the world of 
the visual where what can be seen has absolute priority, and there 
s imulates primary nature, immediacy, and the rea l i ty of the body. 

As we saw earlier, socia l  (spatial) pract ice in the first instance intuit­
ively - i .e .  in an init ial intuitus, immediate and close to nature's immedi­
acy - laid hold of a portion of nature which was already divided (and 
hence, too, of a portion of the body with its constitutive dualities) : 
either the hole, the abyss, or else the mound, the shining h i l l ;  either the 
'world' or the 'Cosmos'. And either the curve, the circle, the ring, or 
the straight l ine, ascending or descending. This able manoeuvre, which 
I sought to trace above, made it possible, beginning in the city of the

ancient world, s imultaneously to incorporate femaleness and to demote 
it, to establish dominion over it by assigning it a l imited portion of 
space, and to reduce i t  to a ' femininity' subordinated to the principle 
of maleness, of mascul in i ty or manl iness. The intuitus whereby practice 
first produced a diversity of spaces was to be transformed into a habitus 
and then into an intellectus. These transformations were brought about 
on the basis of immediacy, of sensory impressions that a lready had a 
mental dimension ( intuitus) ,  that were a l ready in some degree detached 
from 'pure' or 'natural '  sensation, a l ready amplified, broadened, elabor­
ated - and hence already metamorphosed. Thus social space emerged 
from the earth and evolved, thanks to a stubbornly pursued process of 
'intellectua l ization ', unti l  an abstract space was constructed, a geometric, 
visual and phal l ic space that went beyond spatia l i ty by becoming the 
production of a homogeneous and pathogenic pol it ical 'medium'  at once 
aberrational and norm-bound, coercive and rational ized : the 'medium' 
of the state, of power and i ts strategies. What is the destiny of this 
absolutely polit ical 'medium' ,  th is space of absolute politics ? At present, 
between metaphorizations and metonymizations, we are approaching 
tautology : we produce only the reproducible, and hence we produce 
only by reproducing or imitating past production. This is the ult imate 
contradiction:  inasmuch as the capacity to produce space produces only 
reproductions, it can generate nothing but the repetitive, noth ing but 
repetition . The production of space is thus transformed into its opposite: 
the reproduction of things in  space. And mimesis (s imulation, imitation) 
becomes merely a reproducibi l ity grounded in received knowledge, tech­
nology and power, because reproducibi l ity is what ensures the renewal 
(or reproduction ) of existing social relations. 

XVIII 

What is commonly referred to as the 'political question' needs to be 
broken down, for like space i tsel f it gives rise to a number of sub­
questions, a number of different themes or problems: there is the ques­
tion of the political sphere in  a general sense, and of its function in 
social practice ; there i s  the question of politics and its part in the 
capitalist mode of production ;  and there is the question of the politicians 
� ,statesmen or henchmen of the state - and of their qual ifications and 
:their selection (so to speak) .  

Questions concerning the state on the one hand and the polit ical 
sphere (or particular political policies) on the other inevitably remain 



378 CONT R A D ICTI O N S  O F  S PACE T O  D I FFERENTIAL SPACE 

abstract - as do answers to them - so long as they are not couched in 
terms of the state's rel ationship to space. 

That relationship, which has a lways been a real one, is becoming 
tighter :  the spatial role of the state, whether in the past or in the present, 
is more patent. Administrative and political state apparatuses are no 
longer content ( i f  they ever were) merely to intervene in an abstract 
manner in the investment of capital (in the properly economic sphere) .  
So long a s  units of economic production and o f  social activity were 
scattered across the land, only the state was capable of binding them 
into a spatial unity - that of the nation. At the end of the Middle Ages 
in Western Europe, the towns and the urban systems substituted a 
secularized space for the absolute ( rel igious) space of earl ier centuries. 
I t  was in this political space, a l ready unitary in character though sti l l  
made up of scattered elements, that there a rose the space of royal power, 
the space of the nation state in the making. This historical relationship 
between the state and space was considered earlier in our discussion. 

Today the state and its bureaucratic and pol it ical apparatuses inter­
vene continual ly in space, and make use of space in its instrumental 
aspect in order to intervene at all levels and through every agency of 
the economic rea lm.  Consequently, (global ) social practice and political 
practice tend to join forces in spatial practice, so achieving a certain 
cohesiveness i f  not a logical coherence. In  France specific localized 
actions are l inked up by the authorities (prefects) to global actions 
dictated by so-ca l led planning-guidelines and national plans. Nothing 
that happens within the nation's borders remains outside the scope of 
the state and i ts 'services ' .  These cover space in its entirety . 

Only those individuals who th ink and operate at the state level are 
fami l iar  with a l l  regional and local arrangements, with al l  the flows and 
networks (such as those which connect 'manpower deposits' to places 
where labour power is productively consumed ) .  

The fact remains, however, that the proliferation of links and net­
works, by directly connecting up very diverse places, and by ending their 
isolation - though without destroying the pecul iar ities and differences to 
which that very isolation has given rise - tends to render the state 
redundant .  Whence the clamour - sometimes high-pitched and super­
ficia l ,  sometimes stemming from the profoundest of motives - raised on 
a l l  sides by those who want to loosen the grip of power, to decentralize, 
to manage (or self-manage) from the grass roots, whether at the level 
of production (the factory) or at the territoria l  level (town or city ) .  The 
state's tendency to establ ish centres of decision armed with al l  the tools 
of power and subordinated to a single main centre, the capital, thus 



CONTRADICTIONS OF S PACE TO D I FFERENTIAL SPACE 379 

encounters sti ff resistance. Local powers (municipal i ties, departments, 
regions) do not readi ly allow themselves to be absorbed. The state, 
moreover, can neither do everything, nor know everything, nor manage 
everything - indeed its maximum effectiveness consists in the destruction 
of whatever escapes its contro l :  Hegel 's absolute state cannot produce 
itself  in this space because it is bound to destroy itself before it can 
bring the task to completion. 

A certain 'p lural ism' persists, therefore, but one which has no great 
significance so long as open conflict does not erupt among the forces in 
contention - that is to say, among the various groups, classes, or 
fractions of classes that have taken up defensive or offensive postures. 
This is why conflicts between local powers and central powers, wherever 
they may occur in  the world, are of the greatest possible i nterest. Such 
conflicts - occasional ly - al low something other to break the barriers 
of the forbidden. Not that hope should be placed, after the fash ion of 
the American l iberals, i n  plura l i sm per se, but i t  is not unreasonable to 
place some hope in things that plural ism lets by. 

XIX 

Innumerable groups, some ephemeral ,  some more durable, have sought 
to invent a 'new l i fe' - usual ly a communal one. With their trials and 
errors, successes and fai lures, such communal  experiments have so many 
denigrators and champions that we can get a fa irly clea r picture of 
them. Among the obstacles that they have run into and the reasons for 
their fai lure when it occurs must certain ly be numbered the absence of  
an appropriated space, the inabi l i ty to invent new forms. The communi­
ties of earl ier t imes, monast ic or otherwise, had contemplation, not 
enjoyment, as their raison d'etre and goa l .  No doubt there is nothi ng 
more 'beaut ifu l '  than cloisters, but we need to remember that these 
structures were never bui l t  for the sake of beauty or art. Their s ignifi­
cance and purpose was, rather, retreat from the world, ascesis, medi­
tation. It is a curious and paradoxical fact that, while spaces dedicated 
to sensual delight have existed, they a re few and far between : aside 
from the Alhambra with i ts gardens, and certai n  chateaux of the Loi re, 
and perhaps a few v i l las of Pal ladio's, it is hard to th ink of real examples 

· as opposed to l i terary and imaginary ones - the Abbey of Theleme, the 
·'palaces of the Arabian Nights, or the dreams of a Fourier. An a rchitec­
· ture of pleasure and joy, of community in the use of the gifts of the 
·:earth, has yet to be invented. When one asks what agencies have 



380  CONTRA D I CTIONS O f  SPACE T O  DI FFERENTIAL S P A C E  

informed social demands and commands, the answer is much more l ikely 
to be commerce and exchange, or power, or productive labour, or renunci­
ation and death, than enjoyment and rest ( in the sense of non-work ) .  

Listening - even with ha lf  a n  ear - to the vengefu l discourse o f  a 
Valerie Solanas in her S. C. U.M. Manifesto, powered as it may well be 
by deep resentments, it is hard to resist the conclusion that it is time 
for the sterile space of men, founded on violence and misery, to give 
way to a women's space. It would thus fal l  to women to achieve 
appropriation, a responsibi l ity that they would successful ly fu lfi l  - in 
sharp contrast to the inabi l ity of male or manly designs to embrace 
anything but joy less domination, renunciation - and death . 

Most i f  not al l  modem experiments in communal  l iving have diverted 
an existing space to their own pu rposes and so lost their impetus on 
account of an inappropriate spatial morphology: bourgeois mansions, 
ha lf-ruined castles, v i l lages abandoned by the peasantry, suburban villas, 
and so forth . 

In the end, the invention of a space of enjoyment necessari ly implies 
going through a phase of elitism. The el ites of today avoid or reject 
quantitative models of consumption and homogenizing trends. At the 
same time, though they cultivate the appearance of di fferences, these 
e l i tes a re in fact indistinguishable from one another. The 'masses', 
meanwhile, among whom genuine differences exist, and who at the 
deepest ( unconscious) level seek di fference, continue to espouse the 
quantitative and the homogeneous. The obvious reason for th is is that 
the masses must survive before they can live. 

Elites thus have a role, and first and foremost that role is to indicate 
to the masses how d i fficult - and indeed impossible - it is to live 
according to the strict constraints and criteria of quantity. It is true, of 
course, that the masses a l ready experience this impossibi l ity in their 
working l ives; but this awareness has yet to be extended to the whole 
of l i fe 'outside work'. 

Whatever the outcome of the el itist quest for community, however, 
no matter how the relationship between el ites and the labouring masses 
may turn out, the production of a new space commensurate with the 
capaci ties of the productive forces (technology and knowledge) can never 
be brought about by any particu lar  social group;  it must of necessity 
resu l t  from relationships between groups - between classes or fractions 
of classes - on a world scale. 

There should therefore be no cause for su rprise when a space-related 
issue spurs col laboration (often denounced on that basis by party 
polit icians) between very different kinds of people, between those who 



CONTRA D I CTI O N S  OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTIAL SPACE 3 8 1  

'react' - reactionaries, i n  a traditional political parlance - and ' l iberals ' 
or ' radicals' , progressives, 'advanced' democrats, and even revolutionar­
ies . Such coa l itions around some pa rticular counter-project or counter­
plan, promoting a counter-space in opposition to the one embodied i n  
the strategies of power, occur a l l  over the world, a s  easily i n  Boston,  
New York or Toronto as in Engl ish or Japanese cities. Typica l ly the 
first group - the ' reactors' - oppose a particu lar  project in order to 
protect their own privileged space, their gardens and parks, their nature ,  
their greenery, sometimes their comfortable o ld homes - or sometimes, 
just as l ikely, their fami l iar shacks. The second group - the ' l iberals' or 
'radicals' - wil l  meanwhile oppose the same project on the grounds that 
it represents a seizure of the space concerned by capitalism in a general 
sense, or by specific financial interests, or by a particu lar developer. The 
ambiguity of such concepts as that of ecology, for example, which is a 
mixture of science and ideology, facil itates the formation of the most 
unlikely a l l iances .  

Only a political party can impose standards for the recru itment of 
members and so achieve ideological unity. I t  is precisely the diversity of 
the coalitions just mentioned that explains the suspicious attitude of the 
traditional polit ical parties towards the issues of space. 

xx 

A space in wh ich each individual and/or collective 'subject', reconstituted 
on this new basis, would become acqua inted with use and enjoyment is 
at present only in its infancy. Current notions of an 'a l ternative society '  
or 'counter-culture� are in no way free of confusion . What  might a 
'counter-culture' be, considering how much uncertainty surrounds the 
concept of 'culture' itself - just as much of a ragbag as the notion of 
the unconscious, because i t  is  made the repository as easily of ideology 
as the results of h istory, of ways of l i fe, or of the body's misconstrued 
demands ? What might an  'a l ternative society ' be, given the difficulty of 
defining 'society' ,  and given that all such words lose any clear meaning 
if they do not designate either 'capital ism ' or 'socia l ism' or 'communism' 
'"" terms which have themselves now become equivocal ? 

What runs counter to a society founded on exchange is a primacy of  
_use. What counters quantity is qual ity. We know what  counter-projects 
�onsist or what counter-space consists in - because practice demonstrates 
. it. When a community fights the construction of urban m()torways or 
·h.ousing-developments, when it  demands 'amen ities' or empty spaces for 



382  CONTRA D I CT I O N S  O F  SPACE T O  D I FFERENTIAL SPACE 
play and encounter, we can see how a counter-space can insert itse l f

ural ly, it happens that induced dlfterences - differences internal  to a 
whole and brought into being by that whole as a system aiming to 
establ ish itse lf and then to close ( for example, the suburban 'world of 
vi l las ' )  - are hard to distinguish either from produced di fferences, which 
escape the system's rule, or from reduced differences, forced back into 
the system by constraint and violence. Natural ly, too, it happens that a 
counter-space and a counter-project s imulate existing space, parodying 
it and demonstrating its l imitations, without for all that escaping its 
c lutches. 

The only possibi l ity of so altering the operation of the central ized 
state as to introduce (or reintroduce) a measure of plural ism l ies in a 
cha l lenge to centra l power from the ' local powers', in the capacity for 
action of municipal or regional forces l inked di rectly to the terri tory 
in question. Inevitably such resistance or counter-action wi l l  tend to 
strengthen or create independent territorial entities capable to some 
degree of self-management. Just as inevitably, the central state will 
muster its own forces in  order to reduce any such local autonomy by 
exploiting isolation and weakness. Hence a qu ite specific dialectical 
process is set in train :  on the one hand, the state's reinforcement is 
fol lowed by a weakening, even a breaking-up or withering-away; on the 
other hand, local powers assert themselves vigorously, then lose their 
nerve and fal l  back. And so on - in accordance with a cycle and with 
contradictions which must, sooner or la ter, achieve resolution. What 
form might that resolution take ? Ultimately, perhaps, that of the replace­
ment of the state's machinery by data-processing machines fed and 
managed from below. Putting the spatial problematic into terms of 
forces - the relative strength of socio-polit ical forces - effectively gets 
us out of a number of l udicrous dilemmas : either the city is non-existent 
or else it is a system ; either space is an inert underlay or else it is the 
'medium' of a fu l ly sel f-contained ecological real i ty ;  and either the urban 
sphere occupies a niche or else it is a subject. Just as economic pressure 
from the base - and such pressure alone, in the shape of unions, the 
making of demands, striking, and so forth - is able to modify the 
production of surplus value, so pressure grounded in spatial practice is 
alone capable of modifying the apportionment of that surplus value -
i .e .  the distribution of the portion of socia l  surplus production al lotted 



CONTRA D ICTI O N S  OF SPACE TO D I FF E R ENTI A L  SPACE 383 

to society 's collective ' interests ', to so-cal led social services . Such grass­
roots pressure, i f  it is to be effective in this regard, cannot be confined 
to attacking the state qua guardian of the 'general interest' . For this 
state, born of  the hegemony of a class, has as one of its functions - and 
a more and more significant function - the organization of space, the 
regularization of its flows, and the control of  its networks. It devotes 
to these purposes a considerable part of global surplus value, of the 
surplus production assigned to the running of society. Pressure from 
below must therefore also confront the state in its role as organizer of 
space, as the power that controls urbanization. the construction of 
buildings and spatial planning in genera l .  This state defends class inter­
ests while simultaneously setting i tsel f above society as a whole, and its 
abi l i ty to intervene in space can and must be turned back against it, by 
grass-roots opposition, in  the form of counter-plans and counter-projects 
designed to thwart strategies, plans and programmes imposed from 
above. 

XXI 

The quest for a 'counter-space' overwhelms the supposedly ironclad 
distinction between 'reform' and 'revolution' .  Any proposal along these 
lines, even the most seemingly insignificant, shakes existing space to its 
foundations, a long with its strategies and aims - namely, the imposition 
of homogeneity and transparency everywhere within the purview of 
power and its establ ished order. The silence of the 'users' mentioned 
earl ier may be explained as follows :  consumers sense that the s l ightest 
shift on their part can have boundless consequences, that the whole 
order (or mode of production) weighing down upon them will be 
seriously affected by the sl ighest movement on their part. 

The situation has consequences that seem paradoxical at first. Certain 
deviant or diverted spaces, though init ial ly subordinate, show distinct 
evidence of a true productive capacity. Among these are spaces devoted 
to leisure activity. Such spaces appear on first inspection to have escaped 
the control of the establ ished order, and thus, inasmuch as they are 
spaces of play, to constitute a vast 'counter-space ' .  This i s  a complete 
illusion. The case against leisure is quite simply closed - and the verdict 
is irreversible: leisure is as al ienated and al ienating as labour; as much 
an agent of co-optation as i t  is itself co-opted; and both an ass imi lative 
and an assimi lated part of the 'system' (mode of production ) .  Once a 
conquest of the working class, in the shape of paid days' off, hol idays, 



384  CONT R A D I CT I O N S  O F  SPACE T O  D I FFERENT I A L  S P A C E  

weekends, and so on, leisure has been transformed into an industry, 
in to a v ictory of neocapitalism and an extension of bourgeois hegemony 
to the whole of space. 

As an extension of dominated space, leisure spaces are arranged at 
once functionally and hierarchical ly. They serve the reproduction of 
production relations. Space thus controlled and managed constrains in 
specific ways, imposing its own rituals and gestures (such as tanning), 
discursive forms (what should be said or not said), and even models 
and modulations in space ( hotels, cha lets - the emphasis being on private 
l i fe, on the genital order of the fami ly ) .  Hence this space too is made 
up of ' boxes for l iving in ' ,  of identical 'plans' piled one on top of another 
or j ammed next to one another in rows. Yet, at the same time, the body 
takes its revenge - or at least calls for revenge. I t  seeks to make itsel f 
known - to gain recognition - as generative. (Of what?  Of practice, of  
use, hence of space - and,  by extension, of the human species. ) A 
positivity, then, negated by its own consequences - and later restored. 
The beach is the only place of enjoyment that the human species has 
discovered in nature. Thanks to its sensory organs, from the sense of 
smell and from sexuality to sight (without any special emphasis being 
placed on the visual sphere) ,  the body tends to behave as a differential 
field. It behaves, in other words, as a total body, breaking out of the 
temporal and spatia l  shell developed in response to labour, to the 
division of labour, to the localizing of work and the special ization of 
places. In its tendency, the body asserts itself more (and better) as 
'subject' and as 'object' than as 'subjectivity' ( in the classical phi losophi­
cal sense) and as 'objectivity ' ( fragmented in every way, d istorted by the 
visual ,  by images, etc. ) .  

In and through the space of leisure, a pedagogy of space and time is 
beginning to take shape. As yet, admittedly, this is no more than a 
virtuality, and one which is denied and rejected, but it nevertheless 
indicates a trend (or rather a counter-trend) .  Time, meanwhile, retrieves 
its use value.  And the critique of the space of labour, whether implicit 
or explicit, leads in turn to a critique of fractured (special ized) gestures, 
of s i lence, of discomfort and malaise. 

Despite i ts anachronistic aspect, the return to immediacy, to the 
organic (and hence to nature), gives rise to startling differences . Through 
music - indecisively, clumsily, yet effectively - rhythms reclaim their 
rights. They can no longer be forgotten, even though simulation and 
mimesis have repl aced any true appropriation of being and of natural 
space: and even though the appeal to the body is ever l iable to turn into 



CONTR A D ICTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTIAL S P A C E  385 
its opposite - total passivity on the beach, mere contemplation of the 
spectacle of sea and sun.  

The space of leisure tends - bur i t  is no more than a tendency, a 
tension, a transgression of 'users' in search of a way forward - to 
surmount divisions: the division between social and mental, the division 
between sensory and intellectual , and a lso the division between the 
everyday and the out-of-the-ordinary ( festiva l ) .  

This space further reveals where the vulnerable areas and  potential 
breaking-points are: everyday l i fe, the urban sphere, the body, and the 
differences that emerge within the body from repetitions ( from gestures, 
rhythms or cycles) .  The space of leisure bridges the gap between tra­
ditional spaces with their monumental ity and their localiza tions based 
on work and its demands, and potential spaces of enjoyment and joy ; 
in consequence this space is the very epitome of contradictory space. 
This is where the existing mode of production produces both its worst 
and its best - parasitic outgrowths on the one hand and exuberant new 
branches on the other - as prodigal of monstrosities as of promises (that 
it cannot keep) .  

XXII 

The degree to which a city can resist despoliation, the difficulty encoun­
tered by those who would lay it waste, is well i l lustrated by the case of 
Paris. As in any urban space, someth ing is always going on - but not 
everything that is going on tends in the same direction . While neocapi­
talism and the central iz ing stare reorganize the city's supposedly historic 
section in accordance with their interests, neighbourhoods not far from 
the centre are in the process of becoming more working-class in charac­
ter: around Bellevil le, for example, an a rea that is sti l l  very animated, 
immigrant workers and colons repatriated from North Africa rub shoul­
ders - not without a measure of friction. Meanwhile, the Marais is 
experiencing the influx of an el ite element, but this is an el i te made up 
of intellectuals and of members of the (old and new) l iberal professions, 
which does nor look down its nose at the common people. In  this 
respect, it differs from the old-style bourgeoisie, sti l l  solidly ensconced 

: in the city's ' residentia l '  arrondissements and suburbs. I t  is not inconceiv­
. abl� that the Marais and its vicin ity will long retain some relationship 
'With production - with craft industry, smal l  or medium-size manufactur-
ing ·- and a proletarian and even sub-proletarian population.

Paris has not completely lost the excitement that characterized it as 
a city of festival in earlier times. As 1 968  showed, it is sti l l a crucible, 
sti l l  a focal point. There is an acute contradiction here : it is not in 
the interests of the polit ical establishment and the hegemonic class to 
extinguish this spark, for to do so would effectively destroy the city's 
worldwide reputation - based, precisely, on its daring, its wil l ingness 
to expose the possible and the imposs ib le, its so-called cultural develop­
ment, and its panoply of actions and actors (working class, intell igentsia, 
students, a rtists, writers, and others ) .  Yet at the same time the pol itical 
powers and the bourgeoisie control l ing the economy a re afraid of all 
such ferment, and have a strong urge to crush it under suffocating 
centra l decision-making. 

In  Paris, as in any city worth the name, the al lied effects of central ism 
and monumenta l i ty have not yet run their course. Each of these trends 
is based on s imultaneous inclusion and exclusion precipitated by a 
specific spatial factor. The centre gathers things together only to the 
extent that it pushes them away and disperses them, while a monument 
exercises an attraction only to the degree that it creates distance. It is 
inevitable, therefore, that the reduction of old particularities, of ethnic 
groups, 'cultures' or national ities, should produce new di fferences. It is 
impossible to bring urban real ity to a complete stop . To do so would 
ki l l  it - and in any case it puts up far too strong a resistance. Though 
dominated, ravaged, the urban realm successful ly reconstitutes itself. 
Only i n  the most extreme circumstances could this real ity be reduced 
to a state of inertia, flat on the ground (so to speak) ,  utterly dispersed 
and deanimated. Furthermore this extreme state of affa irs, so hard to 
arrive at, would present peri ls of its own. The contradiction between 
the passivity and the activity of people (of ' inhabitants' or 'users') is 
never completely resolved in favour of passivity. 

There is nothing more contradictory than 'urbanness' .  On the one 
hand, it makes i t  possible in some degree to deflect class struggles. The 
city and urban rea l i ty can serve to disperse dangerous 'elements', and 
they a lso faci l i tate the setting of relatively inoffensive 'objectives' , such 
as the improvement of transportation or of other 'amenities' . On the 
other hand, the city and i ts periphery tend to become the arena of kinds 
of action that can no longer be confined to the traditional locations of 
the factory or office floor. The city and the urban sphere are thus the 
setting of struggle ;  they are a lso, however, the stakes of that struggle. 
How could one aim for power without reaching for the places wher.e 
power resides, without planning to occupy that space and to create a 
new political morphology - something which impl ies a critique in acts 



CONTRAD I CTIONS OF SPACE TO D I FFERENTIAL srACE 387  

of the o ld  one, and hence too of the status o f  the political sphere i tself 
(as of specific political orientations) ?  I t  is worth pointing out in passing 
that i l legitimate hybrids of country and city in  no way escape the 
domination of space, as some people - particularly those who inhabit 
such spaces - seem to bel ieve. On the contrary, these bastard forms 
degrade both urban and rural space. So far from transcending the 
conflict between the two, they thrust both into a confusion which would 
be utterly without form were it not for the 'structure' imposed by the 
space of the state. 

The appropriation of  political ly dominated space poses an enormous 
political problem, one that must remain insoluble so long as no critique 
of the political rea lm, of specific poli tics and of the state is forthcoming 
- so long, in fact, as no withering-away of the state occurs, no matter 
by what route or by virtue of what process. At this level the opposition 
between appropriation and domination becomes a dialectical contradic­
tion, as the appropriation of space, the development of the urban 
sphere, the metamorphosis of everyday l i fe and the transcendence of the 
conflictual spl it between city and country al l  clash head-on with the 
state and with politics. 

Seen from this perspective, dominant/dominated space, as imposed by 
the state upon its 'subjects' ,  be they faithful or not, is simply the space, 
seemingly devoid of violence, of a sort of pax estatica (or, in the case 
of the Western countries, a pax capitalistica) reminiscent of the Pax 
Romana. Though seemingly secured against any v iolence, abstract space 
is in fact inherently violent. The same goes for a l l  spaces promising a 
similar security: residential suburbs, holiday homes, fake countrysides 
and imitations of nature. The Marxist theory of the withering-away of 
the state gets a new lease on l i fe when p laced in the context of the 
following central insight :  state management of space implies a logic of 
stability that is both destructive and self-destructive.

In this connection it is worth reconsidering the grid mentioned earlier 
(see pp. 155-8 ) ,  according to which there are three interacting and 
interwoven levels of space : the publ ic or global, the private, and the 
mixed (mediating or intermediary) levels . The fact is that this grid 
deciphers and apportions socia l  space in  a way quite different from 
political thinking. According to the perspective of pol itics, no part of 
space can or may be a l lowed to escape domination, except in so far as 



388  CONTRADICTIONS O F  SPACE T O  D I FFERENTIA L SPACE 
appearances a re concerned. Power aspires to control space in its enti rety, 
so i t  maintains it in a 'disjointed unity ' ,  as at once fragmentary and 
homogeneous : it d ivides and rules. The grid embodies a di fferent per­
�pective, i f  only because i t  does not keep the spatial elements separate 
from one another with in an abstract space. I t  reintroduces immanent 
d i fferences and envisions spaces at once 'compact' and h ighly elaborated, 
places of encounter and places of transition (passages ) ,  as well as places 
appropriated to meditation and sol i tude. And it is akin to another 
analysis of levels, one which discriminates - without sundering them -
between a 'micro' level (arch itecture ; residence versus housing; 
neighbourhood) ,  a 'medium' level ( the city; town-planning; the 
town-country dichotomy) ,  and final ly a 'macro' level (spatial strategies, 
town and country planning, land considered in national ,  global or 
worldwide terms) .  We should remember, nevertheless, that 'grids' of 
this kind are still confined to the classification of fragments in space, 
whereas authentic knowledge of space must address the question of its 
production.

Political power as such harbours an immanent contradiction. It controls 
flows and it controls agglomerations. The mobil ity of the component 
parts and formants of socia l  space is constantly on the increase, especially 
in the 'economic' realm proper: flows of energy, of raw materials, of 
labour, and so on. But such control, to be effective, cal ls for permanent 
establishments, for permanent centres of decision and action (whether 
violent or not) . There are certa in essentia l  activ ities, moreover, some 
pedagogical in character, some even related to play, that also require 
durable faci l it ies. (Note that the mobi l i ty of flows and agglomerations 
has l i ttle to do with the rhythms and cycles of nature.) A novel and 
quite specific contradiction thus a rises between what is transient and 
what is durable. The diversity of spatia l  forms and the flexibil ity of 
practice can only become more marked, a long with the variety of 
functions, with mult ifunctionality - and indeed with dysfunctionality. 
Can the body in its quest for vindication use the resulting interstices as 
its way back ? And what of primary and 'second' nature ?

It is signs and images - the world of signs and images - that tend to 
fill the interstices in question. Signs of happiness, of satisfaction. S igns 
and images of nature, of Eros . Images and signs of history, of authen­
ticity, of style. Signs of the world: of the other world, and of another 
- a di fferent - world .  Neo-th is and neo-that, consumed as novelties, 
and signs of the old, the venerated, the admirable. Images and signs of 
the future. Signs and images of the urban, of 'urbanness ' .  

This world of images and signs, th is tombstone of the  'world' 
( 'Mundus est immundus' )  is situated at the edges of what exists, between 
the shadows and the l ight, between the conceived (abstraction) and the 
perceived ( the readable/visible) . Between the real and the unrea l .  Always 
in the interstices, in the cracks. Between di rectly l ived experience and 
thought. And (a  famil iar paradox ) between l i fe and death . I t  presents 
itself  as a transparent (and hence pure) world, and as reassuring, on the 
grounds that it ensures concordance between mental and socia l ,  space 
and time, outside and inside, and needs and desire. On the grounds, 
too, that  i t  is unitary: that it instates a ( rediscovered) unity of discourse, 
of language as systematic, of thought as logica l .  The world of signs 
passes itse lf  off as a true world, and perhaps after all i t  has the right to 
do so - which would involve fu rther compromise of the True (the 
absolute) . The rule of this world is founded, then, on transparency. It 
leads, however, into opacity and into naturalness (not that of 'nature' ,  
but that of the signs of nature ) .  This is a fraudulent world, indeed the 
most deceptive of all worlds - the world-as-fraud.  A world where that 
which contains is h idden in corners or lurks on the sidelines. When 
there is talk of art and culture, the real subject is money, the market, 
exchange, power. Talk of communication actual ly refers only to sol i ­
tudes. Talk of beauty refers to  brand images. Talk of city-planning refers 
to nothing at a l l .  

The world of images and signs exercises a fascination, skirts or  
submerges problems, and diverts attention from the ' real '  - i .e .  from 
the possible. While occupying space, it a lso signifies space, substituting 
a mental and therefore abstract space for spatial practice - without, 
however, doing anyth ing real ly to unify those spaces that  it seems to 
· combine in  the abstraction of signs and images. Di fferences are repl aced 
· by differential signs, so that produced differences are supplanted in 
advance by differences which are induced - and reduced to signs. 

The evanescent space of images and signs does not, however, manage 



390 CONTRAD I CTI O N S  O F  SPACE T O  DI FFERENTI A L  SPACE 

to attain consistency. It is a worlq that flees, a world with a perpetua l ,  
indeed a dizzying, need for rejuvenation. I t  even seems at times that this 
world is about to disappear bag and baggage down a hole, into some 
cleft that, with just a l ittle widening, would  swallow it up. Unfortunately, 
to suppose that the right word or gesture could tumble everyth ing down 
the rubbish chute amounts to an existential (or existential ist) i l l usion. 
Anyone tempted to subscribe to such an i l l usion would be wel l advised 
to reca l l  that in the booby-trapped space of images i l lusions are among 
the booby traps . Dispelling the fict itious yet real world of images and 
signs is going to take more than a magic formula or a ritual gesture, 
more than the words of a phi losopher or the arm-wavings of a prophet. 

Factors or causes may be discerned within ' real i ty ' ,  however, that 
may be expected in the long run to interfere with the smooth running 
of the fascinating and ambiguous world of images . In tandem with the 
division of labour, though not identifiable with it, a divers ification of 
products and of operations related to production may be observed. 
Activities anci l lary to manufacture proper have become more and more 
important, with a corresponding decrease in the significance of manual 
labour and of those tasks carried out on the shopfloor itsel f. Some 
people have even spoken in this regard of a 'tertiarization ' of industry. 
The product's conception has much to do with this, for i t  now has to 
take 'needs' into account - whether these are assumed to exist or 
del iberately created, genuinely present or simply manipulated - and 
hence must deal with a mass of information. The organization of pro­
ductive labour gets increasingly complex in consequence, as conceptual 
considerations and considerations of profit have to be reconciled and 
as product cycles themselves diversify more and more. There is a prol ifer­
ation, too, of business services, and much more widespread subcon­
tracting of auxi l iary tasks. Another outcome is that urban centres 
(formerly known as cities) tend to take over a l l  the intellectual aspects 
of the productive process ( formerly known as science's role in production 
- or knowledge as one of the forces of production ) .  This leads in turn 
to struggles for influence, power and prestige among the scientific and 
business groups concerned. 

I t  may be asserted with reasonable confidence that the process of 
producing things in space (the range of  so-ca lled consumer goods) 
tends to annul rather than reinforce homogenization. A number of 
d ifferentiating traits are thus permitted to emerge which are not com­
p letely bound to a specific location or situation, to a geographically 
determinate space. The so-called economic process tends to generate 



CONTRADICTI ONS OF SPACE TO DI FFERENTIAL SPACE 39 1  

diversity8 - a fact which supports the hypothesis that homogenization 
today is a function of political rather than economic factors as such ; 
abstract space is a tool of power. Spatial practice in genera l ,  and the 
process of urbanization in particular (the explosion of the old cities, the 
extension of the urban fabric, and the formation of centres ) cannot be 
defined un iquely in terms of industrial growth seen from the standpoint 
either of its quantitative results or of its technological features . The 'city' 
can be conceived of neither as a productive enterprise and unit, as 
a kind of vast factory, nor as a consumption unit subordinated to 
production .  

I t  w i l l  b e  clear from the foregoing ana lysis that social  space (spatial 
practice) h as by now ach ieved - potential ly - a measure of freedom 
from the abstract space of quantifiable activities, and hence too from 
the agendas set by reproduction pure and simple. 

XXVI 

The more careful ly one examines space, considering it not only with the 
eyes, not only with the intellect, but also with a l l  the senses, with the 
total body, the more clearly one becomes aware of the conflicts at work 
within it, conflicts which foster the explosion of abstract space and the 
production of a space that is other. 

Spatial practice is neither determined by an existing system, be it 
urban or ecological, nor adapted to a system, be it economic or political .  
On the contrary, thanks to  t he  potential energies of a variery of groups 
capable of diverting homogenized space to their own purposes, a theatri­
calized or dramatized space is liable to arise. Space is l iable to be 
eroticized and restored to ambiguity, to the common birthplace of needs 
and desires, by means of music, by means of differential systems and 
valorizations which overwhelm the strict localization of needs and 
desires in spaces specia l ized either physiological ly (sexuality) or socially 
(places set aside, supposedly, for pleasure ) .  An unequal struggle, some­
times furious, sometimes more low-key, takes place between the Logos 
and the Anti-Logos, these terms being taken in their broadest possible 
sense - the sense in which Nietzsche used them. The Logos makes 

8 These remarks are inspired by Radovan Rich ta, La civilisation au carrefour (Paris :  
Scu il ,  1974), translated from the Czech : Civilizdcia 11a rdzcesti (Bratislava:  Vydavatel 'stvo 
literatury, 1 966).  



3 92 CONTRADICTIONS Of SPACE TO D I FFER ENTI A L  S P A C E  

inventories, classifies, a rranges : it cultivates knowledge and presses it 
into the service of power. Nietzsche's Grand Desi re, by contrast, seeks 
to overcome divisions - divisions between work and product, between 
repetitive and di fferentia l ,  or between needs and desires. On the side of 
the Logos is rational i ty, constantly being refined and constantly asserting 
itse lf  in  the shape of organizational forms, structural aspects of industry, 
systems and efforts to systematize everything, and so forth . On th is side 
of things are ranged the forces that aspire to dominate and control 
space: business and the state, institutions, the family, the 'establishment', 
the established order, corporate and constituted bodies of a l l  kinds. In 
the opposite camp are the forces that seek to appropriate space : various 
forms of  self-management or workers' control of territorial and indus­
tri a l  enti ties, communities and communes, el i te groups striving to change 
l i fe and to transcend political institutions and parties. 

The psychoanalytical account of conflict between a pleasure principle 
and a rea l i ty principle gives only an abstract and feeble idea of this 
great struggle. The ful l -blown conception of the revolution has to com­
pete with a variety of corruptions, among them economistic and prod­
uctivistic interpretations, and versions founded on the work ethic. The 
maximal version derives d irectly from Marx and his project of a total 
revolution entai l ing the end of the state, of the nation, of the family, of 
poli tics, of history, and so on, and adds to the central idea of an ever­
greater automation of the productive process the related notion of the 
production of a space that is di fferent. 

Implicit in the great Logos-Eros dia lectic, as well as in the conflict 
between 'domination' and 'appropriation ' ,  is a contradiction between 
technology and technicity on the one hand, and poetry and music on 
the other. A dia lectical contradiction, as it is surely needless to recal l ,  
presupposes unity as well as confrontation .  There is thus no such thing 
as technology or technicity in  a pure or absolute state, bearing no trace 
whatsoever of appropriation. The fact remains, though , that technology 
and technicity tend to acquire a distinct autonomy, and to reinforce 
domination far more than they do appropriation, the quantitative far 
more than they do the qual itative. S imi larly, a lthough a l l  music or poetry 
or drama has a technical - even a technological - aspect, th is tends to 
be incorporated, by means of appropriation, into the qualitative realm. 

The effect in space is the development of mult ifarious distortions and 
discrepancies - which should not, however, be mistaken for differences. 
Possibi l i ties are blocked ; mobil ity declines into fixedness. Does space 
also secrete a false consciousness ? An ideology - or ideologies ? Abstract 
space, considered together with the forces that operate within it, some 



CONTR A D I CT I O N S  OF SPACE TO D I F F E R E NT I A L  S P A C E  393 
of which serve to sustain and some to modify i t ,  may accurately be  said 
to bring manifestations of false consciousness and ideology in its wake. 
As a space that is fetishized, that reduces possibi l ities, and cloaks con­
flicts and di fferences in i l l usory coherence and transparency, it clearly 
opera tes ideologica l ly .  Yet abstract space is the outcome not of an 
ideology or of fa lse consciousness, but of a practice. Its falsification is 
sel f-generated . Conflicts nevertheless manifest themselves on the level ,  
precisely, of  knowledge, especia l ly  that between space and time. The 
oppressive and repressive powers of abstract space are clearly revealed 
in connection with t ime: this space relegates time to an abstraction of 
its own - except for labour time, which produces things and surplus 
value. Time might thus be expected to be quickly reduced to constra ints 
placed on the employment of space : to distances, pathways, itineraries, 
or modes of transportation. In fact, however, time resists any such 
reduction, re-emerging instead as the supreme form of wealth, as locus 
and medium of use, and hence of  enjoyment. Abstract space fa ils in the 
end to lure time into the rea lm of external ity, of signs and images, of 
dispersion. Time comes back into its own as privacy, inner l i fe, subjec­
tivity. Also as cycles closely bound up with nature and with use (s leep, 
hunger, etc. ) .  Within time, the investment of a ffect, of energy, of 'creativ­
ity' opposes a mere passive apprehension of signs and signifiers . Such 
an investment, the desire to 'do' something, and hence to 'create', can 
only occur in a space - and through the production of a space. The 
'real ' appropriation of space, which is incompatible with abstract signs 
of appropriation serving merely to mask domination, does have certain 
requirements. 

XXVII 

The dialectica l relationship between 'need' and 'desi re' is only partly 
germane to our present theoretical investigation and discussion . Already 
obscure in itsel f, and even further obscured by the pronouncements of 
the ecologists, this relationship deserves to be clarified on its own terms. 
The concept of  need impl ies or assumes certain determinants. There 
exist needs, in the p lural, distinct one from the next; and, although the 
notion of a ' system of needs' was introduced as early as Hegel, such a 
system can only be conceived of as having a momentary real ity, as 
formed with in a tota l i ty and in accordance with the requirements of 
that total i ty (culture, ideology, eth ical system, division of labour, etc. ) .  
- Each need finds satisfaction in its object, i n  the consumption o f  that 



394 CONTRADICTIONS OF S l'ACE TO DIFFERENT I A L  SPACE 

object, yet such satisfaction el iminates the need only temporari ly, for a 
need is repetitive in character and after being satisfied wil l  ar ise again 
and again,  stronger and more urgent, unt i l  at last i t  reaches a saturation 
point or is extinguished. 

As for desire, the concept never sloughs off its ambigu i ty, even if 
rhetoric tends to present i t  as a ful lness. As applied to a rea l i ty prior to 
the emergence of needs, 'desi re' refers to the energies avai lable to the 
l iving being, energies that tend to be discharged explosively, with no 
definite object, in violent and destructive or  self-destructive ways. Theo­
logical and metaphysical dogma has ever and a lways denied desire's 
init ia l  lack of d ifferentiat ion. For the most consistent theologians, desire 
is a l ready, from the very beginning, a desire for desire and for eternity. 
For the psychoanalysts, des ire ' is' sexual desire - desire for the mother 
or father. The problem here, however, is that desire, though original ly 
undifferentiated - i .e .  objectless, seeking an object and finding it, gener­
a l ly as a result  of stimulation, in the surrounding space - is a lso 
determined as avai lable (explosive) energy. 111is energy takes on defi­
nition - is objectified - in the sphere of need, and in the context of the 
complex relationship 'productive labour - lack - satisfaction ' .  Beyond 
this sphere of defined needs bound to objects (products) ,  'desire' denotes 
the concentration of sti l l -available energies for a particu lar purpose or 
goal .  Instead of a paroxystic moment of destruction or sel f-destruction, 
the aim is now creative: a love, a being, or a work. According to this 
view of matters (whose Nietzschean antecedents should be and are 
intended to be obvious) ,  the doorway of Grand Desire (Eros) thus stands 
open to desire. 

From this perspective, which is more clearly defined poetically, and 
hence qualitatively, than conceptual ly, things and products in space 
correspond to specific needs, if not to a l l  needs : each need looks here 
for satisfaction, and finds and produces i ts object. Particular places serve 
to define the coming-together of a given need and a given object, and 
they a re in turn defined by that meeting. Space is thus populated by 
visible crowds of objects and invisible crowds of needs. 

What Girard says of  'objects' and 'subjects ' applies equal ly wel l to 
most spaces : consecrated by violence, they derive their prestige from 
sacrifice or murder, war or terror. 9 

Needs (a l l  needs and each separately) tend to recur, and hence require 
that their objects too be recurrent (this is so whether these objects are 
artificial or real - the d istinction being hard to draw) ;  at the same time, 

• See Rene Girard, La violence et le sacre ( Par is :  Grasser, 1 972) .  



CONTRAO ICTIONS OF SPACE TO OIHERENT I A L  SPACE 395 

however, needs also increase in  number; and they die from repeti tion -
from the phenomenon of saturation. Desi re, which precedes needs and 
goes beyond them, is the yeast that causes this rather l i feless dough to 
r ise .  The result ing movement prevents stagnation and cannot help but 
produce di fferences . 

XX VIII 

In mathematics and the exact sciences, repetition ( i teration, recurrence)  
generates difference. Induced or reduced, such difference tends towards 
formal identity, with whatever is left over being immediately assessed 
and subjected to a new, more thorough analysis . This sequence of 
operations is performed as nearly as possible in the clear l ight of strict 
logic. Th is is how numerical series come into being, from the number 
one to the transfinite numbers. In the experimental sciences, only a 
permanent apparatus and precisely repeated conditions make it possible 
to study variations and variables ( i .e .  remainders ) .  

In music or poetry, by contrast, difference is what  engenders the 
repetitive aspect that wil l  make that difference effective. Art in  general 
and the artistic sensibi l i ty bank on maximum di fference, at first merely 
virtual ,  sensed, anticipated, and then, final ly, produced. Art puts its 
faith in di fference : this is what is known as ' inspiration', or as a 'project ' ;  
this is the motive of a new work - the thing that makes i t  new; 
only subsequently does the poet, musician or painter seek out means, 
procedures, techniques - in short, the wherewithal to real ize the project 
by dint of repeti tion .  Often enough, the project comes to naught, the 
inspiration turns out to have been va in :  the posited and supposed 
difference turns out to have been an i l lusion, an appearance incapable 
of appearing - incapable, i n  other words, of objective self-production 
through the use of appropriate means (materials and materiel) . The 
infinity of the project, easily mistaken (subjectively) for the infinity of 
mean ing, aborts. The origina l i ty of the outline was a superfluity, its 
novelty a mere impression or conceit .  

The enigma of the body - its secret ,  at  once banal and profound - is  
its abi l i ty, beyond 'subject' and 'object' (and beyond the phi losophical 
distinction between them) ,  to produce di fferences 'unconsciously' out of 
repetitions - out of  gestures ( l inear) or out of rhythms (cyclica l ) .  In the 
misapprehended space of the body, a space that is both close by and 
distant, this paradoxical j unction of repetitive and differentia l  - this 
most basic form of 'production' - is forever occurring. The body's secret 



396  C O NT R A D ICTI ONS O F  SPACE T O  D I F F E R E N T I A i .  S P A C E  

is a dramatic one, for the time thus brought in to being, though a bea rer 
of the new, as in the progression from immaturity to maturi ty, also 
brings forth a terrible and tragic repetition - indeed the ult imate rep­
etition : old age and death . This is the supreme di fference. 

Abstract space (or those for whom it is a tool )  makes the relationship 
between repetition and di fference a more antagonistic one. As we have 
seen, this space rel ies on the repetitive - on exchange and interchange­
abi l i ty, on reproducibil ity, on homogeneity. It reduces di fferences to 
induced differences : that is, to di fferences internal ly acceptable to a set 
of 'systems' which are planned as such, prefabricated as such - and 
which as  such are completely redundant. To this reductive end no means 
is spared - not corruption, not terrorism, not constraint, not violence. 
(Whence the great temptation of counter-violence, of counter-terror, as 
a way of restoring difference in and through use. )  Destruction and sel f­
destruction, once accidental, have been transformed into laws of l i fe. 

Just l ike the fleshly body of the l iving being, the spatial body of 
society and the social body of needs differ from an ' abstract corpus' or 
'body' of signs (semantic or semiological - ' textua l ' )  in the fol lowing 
respect: they cannot live without generating, without producing, without 
creating differences. To deny them this is to kill them. 

Not far above this lower l imit of  'being' a re to be found certain 
struggl ing producers, among them architects, 'urbanists' and planners. 
There a re others, however, who are perfectly at  home here, in dominated 
space, manipulating exchangeable and interchangeable, quantities and 
signs - sums of money, 'real property', boxes for l iving in, technologies 
and structures . 

The architect occupies an especial ly uncomfortable position. As a 
scientist and technician, obl iged to produce within a specified frame­
work, he has to depend on repetition. In his search for inspiration as 
an artist, and as  someone sensitive to use and to the 'user', however, 
he has a stake in d i fference. He is located wil ly-ni l ly within this painful 
contradiction, forever being shuttled from one of its poles to the other. 
His is the d ifficult task of bridging the gap between product and work, 
and he is fated to live out the conflicts that arise as he desperately seeks 
to close the ever-widening gulf between knowledge and creativity. 

The 'r ight to difference' is a formal designation for something that 
may be achieved through practical action, through effective struggle -
namely, concrete differences. The right to di fference implies no 
entitlements that do not have to be bitterly fought for. This is a 'right' 
whose only j ustification lies in  its content ; it is thus diametrically 
opposed to the right of property, which i s  given validity by its logical_

Some theorists of art and architecture (Umberto Eco, for instance) insist 
heavily and at  length upon the d i fferential role of semiological elements, 
including the curve and the straight l ine, the square form and the circular 
(or ' radical-concentric') form. Th is emphasis has a certain j ustification, 
and the concept of a semantic or semiotic 'di fferentia l '  is not without 
its uti l ity. Once the distinction between minimal ( induced) differences 
and maximal (produced ) differences is brought to the fore, however, 
things appear in a somewhat changed l ight. To build a few blocks of 
flats that are spiral in form by adding a handful of curves to the usual 
concrete angularities is not an  entirely negl igible achievement - but 
neither does it amount to very much . To take inspiration from Andalusia, 
and demonstrate a sensual use of curvatures, spirals, arabesques and 
inflexions of  a l l  kinds, so achieving truly voluptuous spaces, would be 
a different matter al together. Neither the plant world nor the minera l  
world has as yet delivered itse lf  of a l l  the lessons it holds regarding 
space and the pedagogy of space. With in a given genus or species of 
plant, 'nature' induces differences ; no two trees, nor even two leaves of 
a single tree, are completely identica l - a fact noted by Leibniz in 
h is  exploration of the paradoxical relationship between identity and 
repetition on the one hand and dissimi larity and differentiation on the 
other. Yet nature, at another level, also produces differences: di fferent 
species; di fferent vegetable or animal forms; trees with a different tex­
ture, a di fferent stance, or a different type of leaf. And all these differ­
ences are produced within the rea lm of the tree form, which is of course 
circumscribed by its own l imiting conditions. 

Why should spaces created by v i rtue of human understanding be any 
less varied, as works or products, than those produced by nature, than 
landscapes or l iving beings ?

'We can now begin to see the ful l  implications of difference, which 
ultimately generates the contradiction between true space and the truth 
of space. 



398  CONTRAD I CT I O N S  O F  SPACE T O  D I F F E R E NT I A L  S P A C E  

True space, the space of phi losophy and of its epistemologica l off­
shoot, seamless in al l  but an abstract sense, wrapped in the mantle of 
science, takes form and is formulated in the head of a th inker before 
being projected onto social and even physical ' real ity' .  Every effort is 
made to legi t imize it by appealing to knowledge and to the formal kernel 
of knowledge. I t  is thanks to true space that we witness the rise of 
' theoretical man'  - the rise of the human rea lm reduced to the rea lm of 
knowledge, conceptualization passed off as di rect experience. A kernel 
of knowledge thus claims necessary and sufficient status; and the centre 
aspires to be definite and defini tive - and hence also absolute. It is of 
l i ttle consequence whether such claims are buttressed by political econ­
omy, by h istory, or by l inguistics - whether or not ecology is cal led 
upon to fil l  in gaps in the picture - for the strategic approach is 
identical in every case. And so is the goal sought.The resu lts are a super­
dogmatism, sometimes unaccompanied by any clear-cut dogma, and an 
arrogant  a ttitude which carries the old system-bui lding of the philos­
ophers to a new extreme. The stage of destruction and of self-destruction 
is soon reached. True space is a mental space whose dual function is to 
reduce ' real '  space to the abstract and to induce minimal differences. 
Dogmatism of this kind serves the most nefarious enterprises of econ­
omic and political power. Science in general and each scientific special iz­
ation separately are the immediate servants of both administration and 
production within the framework of the dominant mode of production. 
The official account makes no bones about the fact that society 's admin­
istrators feel the need for assistance from science when they find them­
selves confronted by 'an increasingly complex environment' with which 
they would l ike to establish a 'new relationship' .  This 'public service' 
role assumed by a phi losophy and science now installed and constituted 
as an official  knowledge is legitimated by conflating mental space and 
political space, so constructing a 'system' whose long-lived and solid 
prototype is Hegelianism. In  consequence, not only the idea of the True, 
but a lso that of meaning, and those of l ived experience and of ' l iving', 
are severely compromised . Representational space disappears into the 
representation of space - the latter swallows the former; and spatial 
practice, put into brackets along with social practice as a whole, endures 
only as the unthought aspect of the thought that has now pronounced 
itself sovereign ruler. 

By contrast, running counter to this dominant and officia l  tendency, 
the truth of space ties space on the one hand to social practice, and on 
the other hand to concepts which, though worked out and linked 



CONTRADICTIONS OF S PACE TO D I FFERENTI AL SPACE 399 

theoretical ly by philosophy, in fact transcend philosophy as such pre­
cisely by virtue of their connection with practice. Social space calls for 
a theory of production, and it is this theory that confirms its truth . 

The truth of space reveals what mental space and social space have 
in common - and consequently also the differences between them. There 
is no rift between the two, but there is a distance. There is no confusion 
between them, but they do have a common moment or element. Knowl­
edge, consciousness and socia l  practice may thus a l l  be seen to share 
the centre. There is no ' rea l i ty '  without a concentration of energy, 
without a focus or core - nor, therefore, without the dialectic: centre­
periphery, accretion-dissipation, condensation-radiation, glomeration 
-saturation, concentration-eruption, implosion-explosion. What is the 
'subject' ? A momentary centre. The 'object' ? Likewise. The body? A 
focusing of active (productive) energies. The city ? The urban sphere ?  
Ditto. 

The form of centrality which, as a form, is empty, calls for a content 
and a ttracts and concentrates particular objects. By becoming a locus 
of action, of  a sequence of operations, this form acquires a functional 
real i ty .  Around the centre a structure of (mental and/or socia l )  space is 
now organized, a structure that i s  always of the moment, contributing, 
along with form and function, to a practice. 

The notion of centrality replaces the notion of totality, repositioning 
it, relativizing it, and rendering it dialectical .  Any centra l i ty ,  once estab­
lished, is destined to suffer dispersal ,  to dissolve or to explode from the 
effects of saturation, attrition, outside aggressions, and so on. This 
means that the 'real '  can never become completely fixed, that it is 
constantly in  a state of mobil ization . lt a lso means that a general figure 
(that of the centre and of 'decentring') is in play which leaves room for 
both repetition and difference, for both time and juxtaposit ion. 

What we have been considering, then, is an extension, after a h iatus, 
of traditional phi losophy and of Marxist thought, an extension which 
embraces the radical critique of philosophy without, however, aban­
doning Hegel 's teaching on the concrete universal and the import of the 
concept. We are concerned, in  other words, with theory beyond system­
building. 

The truth of space thus leads back (and is reinforced by) a powerfu l 
Nietzschean sentiment: 'But may the wil l  to truth mean this to you :  
that everyth ing shal l  be transformed into the humanly-conceivable, the 
humanly-evident, the humanly-palpable ! You should follow your own

Openings and Conclusions 

I 

There is a question impl icit in the foregoing ana lyses and interpretations. 
It is this :  what is the mode of existence of social relations ? 

No sooner had the social sciences establ ished themselves than they 
gave up any interest in the description of 'substances' inherited from 
phi losophy :  'subject' and 'object', society ' in i tself', or the individual or 
group considered in isolation . Instead, l ike the other sciences, they took 
relationships as their object of study. The question is, though, where 
does a relationship reside when it is not being actual ized in a highly 
determined situation ? How does it await its moment ?  In what state does 
it exist unti l  an action of some kind makes it effective ? Referring vaguely 
to global praxis is a distinctly inadequate way of responding to these 
questions. In analysing the socia l  relationship, it is impossible simply to 
dub it a form, for the form as such is empty, and must have a content 
in order to exist. Nor can it be treated as a function, which needs objects 
if it is to operate. Even a structure, whose task it is to organize elemen­
tary units within a whole, necessari ly cal l s  for both the whole and the 
component units in  question. Thus ana lytic thought finds itse l f  returning, 
by virtue of its own dynamic, to the very entities and 'substantia l i ties' 
that it had original ly banished: to 'subject' and 'object', to the uncon­
scious, to global praxis, and so on. 

Granted, then, that a social relationship cannot exist without an 
underpinning, we sti l l  have to ask how that underpinning 'functions ' .  
The 'material substrate' that h istorians and sociologists are inclined to 
see in the population, or among everyday objects of uti l ity, does not 
supply an answer. What, it may be asked, is the relationship of the 
'underpinning' to the relationship that i t  supports and bears ? Thus to 



402 OPE N I NGS A N D  CONCLUSI O N S  
complicate the question by rephrasing it a t  a meta-level ,  while it brings 
us no closer to an answer, does at least show up the difficulty. The 
theoreticians of the Logos and of language (Hegel and Marx themselves) 
saw the problem clear ly :  there can be no thought, no reflection, without 
language, and no language without a materia l  underpinning - without 
the senses, without mouths and ears, without the disturbance of masses 
of a i r, without voices and the emission of articulated signs. There are 
two antithetical ways of interpreting this. For some, among them Hegel 
and presumably Marx, these 'conditions' are rea l ized because they 
'express ' a pre-existing rational ity .  For others, by contrast, meanings 
and signs 'express' nothing - they are arbitrary, and l inked solely by 
the requirements of differences of an induced kind within a set of 
conventions. So far has this argument from the arbi trariness of the sign 
been carried that language itsel f  has been brought into question, and it 
has become necessary to introduce new underlying factors such as the 
body, drives, and so on. 

The solution based on the intervention of a pre-existing Logos, at 
once substantial and eterna l ,  does not effectively put the question to 
rest, because it simply re-emerges on a di fferent level . Both Hegel and 
Marx were thus led by their analyses to identify ' things/not-things' -
or concrete abstractions : in Hegel's case, the concept;  in Marx's, the 
commodity .  Things - which for Marx are the product of socia l  labour, 
destined to be exchanged, and invested for this reason with value in a 
double sense, with use value and exchange value - both embody and 
conceal social relations. Things would thus seem to be the underpinning 
of those relations. And yet, on the Marxist analysis, it is clear that 
things qua commodities cease to be things. And inasmuch as they remain 
things they become ' ideological objects' overburdened with meanings. 
Qua commodities, things can be resolved i nto relations; their existence 
is then purely abstract - so much so, indeed, that one is tempted to see 
nothing in them apart from signs and signs of signs (money) .  The 
question of the underpinning is thus not entirely answered by the 
postulation of a permanent material world.  In the context of our present 
discussion, this question arises, in the first place, apropos of social space. 
This space qual ifies as a 'th ing/not-thi ng', for i t  is neither a substantial 
rea l ity nor a mental rea l i ty, it cannot be resolved into abstractions, and 
i t  consists neither in a col lection of things in space nor in  an aggregate 
of occupied places. Being neither space-as-sign nor an ensemble of signs 
rela ted to space, it has an actua l i ty other than that of the abstract signs 
and real th ings which it includes. The init ia l  basis or foundation of 
social space is nature - natural or physical space. Upon this basis are

superimposed - in ways that transform, supplant or even threaten to 
destroy it - successive stratified and tangled networks which, though 
always materia l  in form, nevertheless have an existence beyond their 
materia l i ty :  paths, roads, railways, telephone l inks, and so on. Theory 
has shown that no space disappears completely, or is utterly abolished 
in the course of the process of social development - not even the natural 
place where that process began .  'Something' always survives or endures 
- 'something' that is not a thing. Each such material underpinning has 
a form, a function, a structure - properties that are necessary but not 
sufficient to define it .  Indeed, each one institutes its own particu lar space 
and has no meaning or aim apart from that space. Each network or 
sequence of l inks - and thus each space - serves exchange and use in 
specific ways .  Each is produced - and serves a purpose ; and each wears 
out or is consumed, sometimes unproductively, sometimes productively. 
There is a space of speech whose prerequisites, as we have seen, are the 
l ips, the ears, the abi l i ty to articulate, masses of air, sounds, and so on. 
This is a space, however, for which such material preconditions are not 
an adequate definition : a space of actions and of inter-actions, of call ing 
and of call ing back and forth , of expressiveness and power, and -
already at this level - of latent violence and revolt ;  the space, then, of 
a discourse that does not coincide with any discourse on or in space. 
The space of speech envelops the space of bodies and develops by means 
of traces, of writings, of prescriptions and inscriptions. 

As for the commodity in genera l ,  it is obvious that ki lograms of sugar, 
sacks of coffee beans and metres of fabric cannot do duty as the material 
underpinning of its existence. The stores and warehouses where these 
things are kept, where they wait, the sh ips, trains and trucks that 
transport them - and hence the routes used - have also to be taken into 
account. Furthermore, having considered al l  these objects individually, 
one sti l l  has not properly apprehended the material underpinning of the 
world of commodities. Nor do such notions as 'channel ' ,  derived from 
information theory, or ' repertoire', help us define such an ensemble of 
objects. The same goes for the idea of 'flows' .  It has to be remembered 
that these objects constitute relatively determinate networks or chains 
of exchange with in  a space. The world of commodities would have no 
'real ity' without such moorings or points of insertion, or without their 
existing as an ensemble. The same may be said of  banks and banking­
networks vis-a-vis the capital market and money transfers, and hence 
vis-a-vis the comparison and balancing of profits and the distribution 
. of surplus value .  

Ultimately a l l  these processes debouch into the space of the planet as 



404 OPENI NGS AND CONCLUSIONS 

a whole, with its multipl icity of ' layers ' ,  networks and sets of links: the 
world market and the division of labour that it subsumes and develops, 
the space of computer science, of strategic perspectives, and so on.  
Among the levels fa l l ing under the aegis of th is  planetary space are those 
of arch i tecture, of urbanism, and of spatia l  planning. 

The 'world market' is in  no sense a sovereign entity, nor must i t  be 
thought of as an instrumental real i ty manipulated by imperia l isms in 
ful l  and absolute contro l .  Solid in some respects, fragile in others, it has 
a dual character as commodities market on the one hand and as capital 
market on the other - and because of this dual i ty i t  is impossible 
unconditional ly to attribute logic or coherence to it .  We know that the 
technical division of labour introduces cornplementarities ( rationally 
l inked operations ) ,  whereas its social division generates dispari ties, dis­
tortions and conflicts in a supposedly ' i rrationa l '  manner. Social relations 
do not disappear in the 'worldwide' framework. On the contrary, they 
are reproduced at that level. Via all kinds of interactions, the world 
market creates configurations and inscribes changing spaces on the 
surface of the earth , spaces governed by conflicts and contradictions. 

Socia l  relations, which are concrete abstractions, have no real exist­
ence save in and through space. Their underpinning is spatial. In each 
particular case, the connection between this underpinning and the 
relations it supports cal ls for analysis. Such an analysis must imply 
and explain a genesis and constitute a critique of those institutions, 
substitutions, transpositions, metaphorizations, anaphorizations, and so 
forth ,  that have transformed the space under consideration . 

II 

Propositions of this kind themselves imply and explain a project -
namely, the quest for a knowledge at once descriptive, analytic and 
globa l .  If one had to label such an endeavour, it might be termed 'spatio­
analysis' or 'spatiology' .  Th is would be consistent with - and in a sense 
offer a response to - certain terms a lready in use, such as 'semio­
analysis ' or 'socio-analysis' (not to mention 'psychoanalysis' ) .  There is 
thus a certa in advantage to be obtained by using one of these names, 
but the drawbacks are many. In the first place, the basic idea could be 
obscured, for the knowledge sought here is not directed at space itself, 
nor does it construct models, typologies or prototypes of spaces ; rather, 
it offers an exposition of the production of space. A sGieRGtl gf space or 
'spatio-analysis' would stress the use of spa�i;, iis qualitatUre-ptopertie�,

Lastly, a 'spatio-analytic' approach could confuse and hence compro­
mise the idea of an analysis of rhythms - an idea that may be expected 
to put the finish ing touches to the exposition of the production of space. 

The whole of (socia l )  space proceeds from the body, even though it 
so metamorphoses the body that i t  may forget i t  a ltogether - even 
though it may separate itself so radica l ly from the body as to kil l it. 
The genesis of a far-away order can be accounted for only on the basis 
of the order that is nearest to us - namely, the order of the body. Within 
the body itself, spatia l ly considered, the successive levels constituted by 
the senses ( from the sense of smell to sight, treated as different within 
a d i fferentiated field) prefigure the l ayers of socia l  space and their 
interconnections. The passive body (the senses) and the active body 
( labour) converge in  space. The analysis of rhythms must serve the 
necessa ry and inevitable restoration of the total body. This is what 
makes ' rhythm analysis' so important. It also explains why such an 
approach ca l ls for more than a methodology or a string of theoretical 
concepts, more than a system al l  of whose requirements have been 
satisfied . 

III 

With respect to traditiona l  phi losophy, the type of inquiry and theoreti­
cal activity in which we are engaged here may be described as metaphilo­
sophy. The task of metaphilosophy is to uncover the characteristics of 
the phi losophy that used to be, its l anguage and its goals, to demonstrate 
their l imitations and to transcend them. Nothing of the old phi losoph ical 
quest will be abol ished in the process - neither its categories, nor its 
basic theme, nor the set of problems with which it concerned itself. The 
fact is, however, that phi losophy proper came to a halt when faced with 
contradictions that it had cal led forth but could not resolve. Thus space, 
for the phi losophers, was split into two :  into intel l igible space on the 
one hand (the essence and transparency of the spiritual absolute ) ,  and 
·uninte l l igible space on the other ( the degradation of the spirit, absolute 
naturalness outside the spiritua l  realm) .  Consequently, they opted now 
for one, now for the other - now for space-as-form, now for space-as-



406 O P E N I N G S  AND CONCLUSIONS 
substance, sometimes for the luminous space of the Cosmos, sometimes 
for the shadow-fil led space of the world . 

Phi losophy per se cannot surmount these splits and separations; they 
are part and parcel of the philosophical atticude per se, which is by 
definition specu lative, contemplative and systematizing - cut off from 
socia l  practice and active political crit icism. Metaphi losophy, so far 
from pursuing the metaphors of tradit ional phi losophy, rejects them. 
The phi losopher, 'caught in the web of words ', is left beh ind as soon 
as meditation begins to deal with time and space instead of being 
imprisoned by them. 

The critique of phi losophy as an ideology is fraught with difficu l ty ,  
for the concept of truth and the truth of the concept have to be saved 
from the degeneration and destruction towards which phi losophical 
systems on their own downward path tend to drag them. Th is is a task 
that must remain unfinished here, but i t  will be taken up elsewhere, 
notably in the context of a confrontation between the most powerful of 
'syntheses' - that of Hegel - and its radical critique ; this critique is 
rooted on the one hand in socia l  practice (Marx ) ,  and on the other hand 
in a rt, poetry, music and drama (Nietzsche) - and rooted, too, in both 
cases, in  the (materia l )  body. 

As noted, phi losophy stopped dead when i t  came face to face with 
the 'subject' and the 'object' and their relationship. 

As to the 'subject', phi losoph ically privileged in  the Western tradition 
in the shape of the cogito of the thinking ' I '  (whether in its empirical 
or  transcendental version) ,  it simply dissolved - and it did so as much 
practical ly as theoretical ly .  Yet the problem of the 'subject', as raised 
by phi losophy, remains a fundamental one. But what 'subject' ? This 
question is echoed by another - what 'object ' ?  - for a true account is 
equal ly needful in the case of the relationship to the 'object'. The object, 
just as easily as the subject, may assume a burden of ideology (of signs 
and meanings ) .  By conceiving of the subject without an object ( the pure 
thinking ' I '  or res cogitans ) ,  and of an object without a subject (the 
body-as-machine or res extensa) ,  philosophy created an irrevocable rift 
in what it was trying to define. After Descartes, the Western Logos 
sought vainly to stick the pieces back together and make some kind of 
montage. But the unification of subject and object in such notions as 
'man' or 'consciousness' succeeded only i n  adding another philosophical 
fiction to an a l ready long list of such enti ties. Hegel came close to a 
solution, but a fter him the dividing-line between the conceived and the 
directly lived was restored as the outer frontier of the Logos and the 
l imit  of philosophy as such . The theory of the arbitrariness of the sign,

_

which once laid claim to impeccable scientific credentials as a sort of 
disti l l ate of knowledge, served to exacerbate the rift between express ive 
and meaningfu l ,  signifier and signified, mental and real ,  and so on. 

Western philosophy has betrayed the body ; it has actively participated 
in the great process of metaphorization that has abandoned the body ; 
and it has denied the body. The l iving body, being at once 'subject' and 
'object' , cannot tolerate such conceptual division, and consequently 
phi losophical concepts fa ll into the category of the ' signs of non-body' 
Under the reign of King Logos, the reign of true space, the mental and 
the social were sundered, as were the directly lived and the conceived, 
and the subject and the object. New attempts were forever being made 
to reduce the external to the interna l ,  or the social to the mental, by 
means of one ingenious topology or another. Net result ?  Complete 
fai lure !  Abstract spatial ity and practical spatial ity contemplated one 
another from afar, in thrall to the visual realm. Ir. contrast, under the 
ru le of raison d'etat, as elevated in Hegel 's phi losophy to ult imate 
supremacy, knowledge and power contracted a sol id - and l egalized -
al l iance. Both des ire with i ts subjectivism and ideas with their objectivism 
respected this al l iance and fol lowed a hands-off policy with regard to 
the Logos. 

Today the body is  establ ishing itse lf  firmly, as base and foundation, 
beyond philosophy, beyond discourse, and beyond the theory of dis­
course. Theoretical thought, carrying reflection on the subject and the 
object beyond the old concepts, has re-embraced the body along with 
space, in  space, and as the generator (or producer) of space. To say that 
such theoretical thinking goes 'beyond discourse' means that it takes 
account, for the purposes of a pedagogy of the body, of the vast store 
of non-formal knowledge embedded in poetry, music, dance and theatre. 
This store of  non-formal knowledge (non-savoir) constitutes a potential 
true knowledge ( connaissance) . What 'beyond philosophy' means is : 
beyond the locus of substitutions and separations, beyond the vehicle 
of the metaphysical and the anaphoric. The rea lm beyond ph i losophy 
indeed finds its essentia l  voice in  the negation of anaphora - of that 
process by means of which phi losophers have fu rthered the body's 
metamorphosis into abstractions, into signs of  non-body. As for 'meta­
philosophy' , the term implies preservi ng phi losophical concepts in their 
breadth while changing their connotations, while replacing their old 
'objects ' with new ones. We are speaking, therefore, of the abol i tion of 
Western metaphysics, of a tradition of thought running from Descartes 
to the present day via Hegel ,  a tradition that has been successful ly 
incorporated into a society based on raison d 'etat, and at the same t ime 



408 OPENI NGS A N D  CONCLUSIONS 
into a particu lar  conception of space and a particular spatial rea l i ty .  

King Logos is guarded on the one hand by the Eye - the eye of God, 
of the Father, of the Master or Boss - whicli answers to the primacy of 
the visual rea lm with i ts images and i ts graphic dimension, and on the 
other hand by the phal l ic (mi l itary and heroic) principle, which belongs, 
as one of its chief properties, to abstract space. 

The standing of time as i t  relates to this space is problematic, and 
has yet to be clearly defined. When religion and phi losophy took dur­
ation under their aegis, time was in effect proclaimed a mental rea l i ty .  
But spat ia l  practice - the practice of a repressive and oppressive space 
- tends to confine time to productive labour time, and simultaneously 
to diminish l iving rhythms by defining them in terms of the rational ized 
and localized gestures of divided labour. 

Clearly time cannot achieve emancipation at one stroke, or en bloc. 
It is  not so obvious, however, that such a l iberation cal ls necessari ly for 
morphological inventions or for a production of space. That could only 
be clearly established i f  it were possible to show that such an appropri­
ation cannot be effected by diverting already existing spaces or morpho­
logies.

What many people look upon as the conclusion of a well-defined period, 
as the end of this or that (capital ism, poverty, history ,  a rt, etc . ) ,  or else 
as the institution of something new and definitive (an equi l ibrium, a 
system, etc . ) ,  should rea l ly be conceived of solely as a transition. Not 
exactly in Marx's sense, however. It is true that a theory of ' long-term' 
transition may also be found in Marx, for whom history as a whole -
which he sometimes on this account refers to as 'prehistory' - serves as 
a transition between primitive and ful ly developed communism. This 
thesis is dependent upon Hegel ian notions of the dialectic and of the 
negative. Our present approach is a lso based on an analysis of the 
overal l  process and i ts negative aspects, on an analysis that is tied to 
practice. The transition here considered is characterized first of al l  by its 
contradictions :  contradictions between (economic) growth and (social) 
development, between the social and the political, between power and 
knowledge (connaissance) ,  and between abstract and differential space. 
This short list includes only some of the contradictions concerned and 
is not intended as a ranking in any sense ; its purpose is merely to give 
some idea of the poisonous flowers that adorn the present period. To

define this period properly, we must also show whence i t  has come and 
whither it is bound - its terminus a quo and i ts terminus ad quern . 

Its origins l ie very fa r away from us, in an init ial non-labour, in a 
nature that creates effortlessly, that gives instead of sel l ing, a nature in 
which cruelty is hard to distinguish from largesse, in  which pleasure 
and pain are not obviously separate. In this sense it is true to say, no 
matter how worn out and restricted in meaning the phrase may now 
be, that 'art imitates nature' - except for the fact that art seeks to 
separate sensual delight from suffering, and indeed to come down on 
the side of joy. 

The period through which modernity struggles to make its way is 
headed towards another non-labour - that non-labour which is the goal 
of labour and the ult imate sign ificance of the accumulation of means 
(technology, knowledge, machinery ) .  A goal and a significance that a re 
sti l l  far distant, however - and that wil l  never be real ized without risking 
catastrophe, or without bi ttersweet leave-takings of everything once 
valued, everything once triumphant. The bitter analytics of finiteness, 
as brought to the fore by post-Hegel ian phi losophy, and made fashion­
able by a host of 'moderns' s ince Valery, is forever repeating the same 
message : the world is finite, t ime has run out, the reign of fin itude i s  
upon us .  

The same dialectical process leads from primary and primordial nature 
to a 'second nature' ,  from natural space to a space which is at once a 
product and a work, combining art and science with in itself. The coming 
to maturity of th is  second nature is a slow and laborious process : its 
motor is automation, which is constantly pushing forward into the vast 
realm of necessity - the rea lm, that is to say, of the production of 
things in space. The process cannot be completed unti l the seemingly 
interminable period taken up by ( infin itely divided) labour, by accumu­
lation (of wealth, of materia ls and materiel) and by reductions ( i .e .  
obstacles to development generated by establ ished knowledge and 
power) has come to an end. This is a process of gigantic proportions, 
beset by risks and perils of al l  kinds, and liable to abort at the very 
moment when the door to new possibi l ities is  opened. 

The vast transition which we have thus characterized in terms of a 
few major rifts may be defined in many different but convergent ways. 
Space bears clear traces of the process - indeed more than traces: its 
very form stems from the dominance of the male principle, with i ts 
violence and love of warfare; and this principle has in turn been 
reinforced by the supposedly manly vi rtues, as promoted by the norms 
inherent to a dominated and dominating space. Whence the use and 



4 1 0  O P E N I NGS A N D  C O N C L U S I O N S  
overuse of straigh t l ines, right angles, and srrict (recci l inear) perspective. 
The mascul ine virtues which gave rise to dominacion by th is space can 
only lead, as we a re only too well aware, to a genera l ized state of 
deprivation :  from 'private' property to the Great Castration . I t  i s  inevi­
table in  these circumstances that feminine revolts should occu r, that rhe 
female principle should seek revenge. Were such a movement to take 
the form of a feminine ' racism' which merely inverted the mascul ine 
version, it would be a picy. Is a final metamorphosis called for that wi l l  
reverse a l l  earl ier ones, descroying pha l l i c  space and replacing it wi ch a 
'ucerine' space ? We can be sure, ac any race, that chis in itsel f wi l l  not 
ensure the invention of a truly appropriated space, or chat of an archicec­
ture of joy and enjoyment. The contradiction may cherefore be resolved 
in this way, and the spl it bridged . But not necessa rily. 

We may therefore juscifiably speak of a transi tional period between 
the mode of produccion of things in space and the mode of production 
of  space.  The produccion of things was fosrered by capital ism and 
control led by the bourgeoisie and its pol i tical creacion, the state. The 
production of space brings ocher things in its train, among them the 
withering-away of the private ownership of  space, and, s imultaneously, 
of the pol i tical state that dominates spaces. This impl ies a shift from 
dominacion to appropriacion, and the pr imacy of use over exchange (the 
withering-away of exchange value) . I f  these events do not occur, the 
worst surely will - as suggested by a number of  'scenarios of the 
unacceptable' scripted by the futurologiscs. Meanwhile, it is thanks only 
to the notion of a conflict-laden transition from one mode of p roduction 
(that of chings) to anocher (char of space) tha c  ic i s  possible to preserve 
rhe Marxist thesis of the fundamental role of the forces of production 
whi le at the same time l i berating this thesis from the ideology of pro­
ductivity and from the dogma of (quantitative) growth. 

v 

Space is becoming the principal stake of goal-di rected actions and 
struggles. I t  has of course a lways been the reservoir of resources, and 
the medium in which strategies are applied, but i t  has now become 
something more than the cheatre, the disinterested stage or setting, of 
action. Space does not e l iminate the other materials or resources that 
play a part in the socio-pol itical arena, be chey raw materials or the 
most fin ished of p roducts, be they businesses or 'culcure' Rather, it 
brings them all together and then in a sense substi tutes itself for each 



O P E N I N G S  A N D  CO N C L U S I O N S  4 1 1 

factor separately by enveloping it. The outcome is a vast movement in 
terms of wh ich space can no longer be looked upon as an 'essence' ,  as 
an object distinct from the point of view of (or as compared with ) 
'subjects ' ,  as answering to a logic of its own. Nor can it be treated as 
a result or resultant, as an empirical ly verifiable effect of a past, a history 
or a society. Is space indeed a medium ? A mi l ieu ? An intermediary ? It 
is doubrless a l l  of these, but its role is less and less neutral ,  more and 
more active, both as instrument and as goal ,  as  means and as end. 
Confining it to so narrow a category as that of 'medium' is consequenrly 
woeful ly inadequate. 

Di fferential analysis has continual ly stressed the constitutive dualities 
of social space, dualities which underpin more complex - and, most 
importantly, triadic - determinations. These initial dual ities (symmetries/ 
asymmetries ; straight l ines/curves; and so on) ,  have repeatedly  re­
emerged, embedded in each successive recasting of socia l  space, acquiring 
new meanings in the process and invariably subordinated to the overal l  
movement. As the underpinning of production and reproduction, 
abstract space generates i l lusions, · and hence a tendency towards fa lse 
consciousness, i .e .  consciousness of a space at once imaginary and rea l .  
Yet th i s  space itse lf, and the  practice that  corresponds to i t ,  give rise, 
by vi rtue of a critical moment, to a clearer consciousness. No science 
has as yet offered an account of this generative process, and this is as 
true of ecology as i t  is of history. Di fferential analysis brings out the 
variations, p lural ities and mult ipl icities which introduce themselves into 
genetically senior dual ities, as well as the disparities, disjunctions, imbal­
ances, conflicts and contradictions that emerge from them . Because of 
the diversity of  the processes involved, the above exposition may have 
left the impression that abstract space has no clearly defined status. But 
that it is absolutely not so: theory has in fact pinpointed the truth of 
this space - namely, i ts  contradictory character with in the framework 
of the dominant tendency towards homogeneity ( i .e .  towards the estab­
lishment of a dominated space ) .  

Where should we look for logic in th i s  context?  At what  level is i t  
located ? At  that  of a praxeology of space ? Within some particu lar  
system - spatial ,  planning-related, or urban ? Or with in the empirical 
sphere, as part of the employment of space as a tool ? The answer, in 
all cases, is no. Rather, logic cha racterizes a double imposition of 
force : first  in order to mainta in a coherence and, later, in the shape of 
reductionism, in the shape of the strategy of homogenization and the 
fetishization of cohesiveness in and through reductions of all kinds. It  
is logic that governs the capacity - bound up with violence - to separate 



4 1 2  OPENINGS AND CO N C L U S I O N S  

what has h i therto been joined together, to fracture a l l  existing unities. 
This initial hypothesis concerning the relationship between logica l and 
dia lectical has been successively validated and upheld by argument and 
proof.

It is impossible, in fact, to avoid the concl usion that space is assuming 
an increasingly important role in supposedly 'modern' societies, and that 
i f  this role is not already preponderant it very soon wil l be. Space's 
hegemony does not opera te solely on the 'micro' level, effecting the 
arrangement of surfaces in a supermarket, for instance, or in a 'neigh ­
bourhood' of housing-units ; nor does it apply only on the 'macro' level, 
as though it were responsible merely for the ordering of 'flows' within 
nations or continents. On the contrary, its effects may be observed on 
all p lanes and in all the interconnections between them. The theoretical 
error that consists in restricting the import of space to a single discipline 
- to anthropology, political economy, or sociology, for example - has 
been dealt with above. A number of theoretical conclusions sti l l need 
to be drawn, however, from these observations.

O P E N I N G S  A N D  CONCLUSIONS 4 1 3  

A number o f  causes and reasons emerge spontaneously from the 
obscuri ty of h istory in connection with this new situation, which is an 
increasingly important aspect of 'modernity' . They revea l  themselves 
sufficiently, in fact, for reAective thought co get a sense of the multipl icity 
of their interactions. Among them are the world market (commodities, 
capital, manpower, etc. ) ,  technology and science, and demographic 
pressures - each striving for the status of an autonomous force . A 
paradox that we have a lready mentioned and emphasized is the fact tha t  
the  polit ical power which holds sway over 'men' ,  though it dominates the 
space occupied by its 'subjects ' ,  does not control the causes and reasons 
that  intersect with in that space, each of which acts by and for i tsel f. 

Such more or less independent causes and reasons coexist in the space 
consti tuted by their effects, consequences and results ;  as enumerated 
by the cxpercs, these include pollution of various kinds, the potential 
exhaustion of resources, and the destruction of nature. A good number 
of discipl ines - ecology or demography, geography or sociology -
describe these results, without going back to causes and reasons, as 
partial systems. What we have sought to do here is bring together causes 
and effects, consequences and reasons, in such a way as to transcend 
divisions between scientific domains and specia l izations, and to propose 
a un i tary theory. 'Unitary' here must not be taken as implying that 
reasons or consequences, or causes and effects, are in  any way confused 
or muddled on the basis of their spatial s imul taneity or their more or 
less peaceful coexistence. Just the opposite, in fact. The theoretical 
conception we a re trying to work out in no way aspi res to the status 
of a completed ' tota l i ty ' ,  and even less to that of a 'system' or 'synthesis ' .  
It implies discrimination between ' factors', elements or moments. To 
reiterate a fundamental theoretical and methodological principle, this 
approach aims both to reconnect elements that have been separated and 
to replace confusion by clear distinctions ; to rejoin the severed and 
reanalyse the commingled. 

A distinction has to be drawn between the problematic of space and 
spatial practice. The former can only be formulated on a theoretical 
plane, whereas the l atter is empirica l ly  observable. I t  is  not hard, how­
ever, for an i l l - informed approach, one that misunderstands the method 
and the concepts involved, to confuse the two. The 'problematic' - the 
term is borrowed from phi losophy - of space is comprised of  questions 
about mental and social space, about their interconnections, about their 
links with nature on the one hand and with 'pure ' forms on the other. 
As for spatial practice, it is observed, described and analysed on a wide 
range of levels: in  architecture, in  city planning or 'urbanism' (a term 



4 1 4  OPEN I N (;� A N D  C O N C L.l l 5 1 0 N S  

borrowed from official pronouncements ) ,  in  the actual design of routes 
and local i ties ( ' town and country planning' ) ,  in che organization of 
everyday l i fe, and, natural ly, in urban rea l i ty .  

Knowledge has been bu i l t  up on the bas i s  of (globa l )  schemata. Once 
such schemata were atemporal, as in the case of classical metaphysics. 
After Hegel ,  however, they became temporal in character, wh ich is to 
say that they procla imed the priority of h istorical becoming, of mental 
durat ion, or of socio-economic time, over space. This theoretical posture 
cried out to be overturned - something that has indeed been attempted, 
though on i ndefens ib le grounds, by those eager to assert a priority of 
geographical, or demographic, or ecological space over hi storical time. 
In  point of fact a l l  these sciences are a l ready the battleground of an 
immense confrontation between the temporal and the spat ia l .  Th is con­
frontation is not one which could precipitate a crisis of knowledge, or 
force a reconsideration of the rel ationsh ip of knowledge to a political 
power which is so effective with respect to people, yec so impotent as 
regards those determinations ( cechnologica l ,  demographic, etc. ) that put 
their  stamp on abstract space, so producing that space as such and 
reproducing socia l  relations within it. 

Languages, each in particu lar  and all of them in genera l ,  all l i nguistic 
systems, including that of establ ished knowledge, are spoken and written 
in a mental time and space to which that knowledge tends to assign a 
privi leged metaphysical status. They are clumsy in the way they give 
u tterance to socia l  time, to spatial practice. How could it be otherwise, 
considering that ord inary languages, whether lexica l ly  or syntactically 
v iewed, have peasant origins, wh i le even the more highly elaborated 
l inguistic systems have theological-phi losoph ical antecedents ? As for 
industry and its techniques, as for the 'modern sciences', they have only 
j ust begun to affect vocabulary and grammar.  Urban rea l ity has hardly 
any intluence at all - as witness the fact that we simply lack the words 
for i t :  the word usager ( ' user' ) ,  for example, which has been cal led upon 
for the purposes of our present discussion, as yet means very little in 
French, and it  has no establ ished meaning in this context in English. 
The fact is  that l anguages and l inguistic systems need to be dismantled 
and reconstructed. This rask wi l l  be carried out by and in (spat ia l )  social 
practice. 

The salvation of knowledge (connaissance) depends entirely upon a 
methodological re-examination of its establ ished forms (savoir), which 
congeal  it by means of epistemology and seek to institute a supposedly 
absolute knowledge which is in fact no more than a pale imitation of 
divine wisdom .  The only road for such a re-examination to take is rhe

unification of critical knowledge with the critique of  knowledge. The 
critical d imension of understanding must be brought to the fore. Col­
lusion between 'knowledge' and 'power' must be forcefu l ly  exposed, as 
must the purposes to which bureaucracy bends knowledge's special iz­
ation. When institutional (academic) knowledge sets itsel f up above l ived 
experience, j ust as the state sets itse l f  up above everyday l i fe, catastrophe 
is in the offing. Catastrophe is indeed al ready upon us. 

In the absence of a reconstruction of this kind, knowledge must 
inevitably col lapse under the blows of non-knowledge and the onslaughts 
of anti-knowledge (or anti-theory) - in short, i t  must relapse into the 
European nih i l ism that Nietzsche bel ieved he had overcome. 

To maintain an unsel fcritical knowledge can only promote the decl ine 
of knowledge. Consider questions about space, for example: taken out 
of the context of practice, projected onto the plane of a knowledge that 
considers itse l f  to be 'pure' and imagines itsel f to be 'productive' (as 
indeed it is  - but only of verbiage), such questions assume a phi losophiz­
ing and degenerate character. What they degenerate into are mere general 
considerations on in tel lectua l  space - on 'writing' as the intel lectual 
space of a people, as the mental space of a period, and so on. 

It is certa inly impossible unreservedly  to objectify representations or 
schemata worked out within a menta l space and referring to that space 
itse l f, even - or rather especia l ly - if they have been developed theoreti­
cal ly by phi losophers or rational ized by epistemologists. On the other 
hand, who can grasp ' real i ty '  - i .e. social and spatial practice - without 
starting out from a mental space, without proceeding from the abstract 
to the concrete ? No one. 

VII 

The distinction between infra and supra, between 'short of' and 'beyond', 
is just as important as that between 'micro' and 'macro' levels. Thus 
there are countries and peoples, in the grip of deprivation and need, 
wliicnmust be said to exist 'short of' the everyday realm, because they 
can only aspire to a firmly grounded everyday l i fe ;  the critique of 
ev�day l i fe becomes meaningful only orn;:e this._threshold  has been

·bet'O'mes more specific, and pol i t ical act iv i ty more special ized . Poli tics 
becomes a profession, and pol i tical machines (state and party 
appara tuses) are institutional ized. This situation in due course gives rise 
to polit ical criticism - that is, to a radical critique of everyday l i fe and 
its apparatuses as such ; and eventual ly the po l i ti ca l rea lm wil l  begin  to 
fade away. Once i t  reaches a certain level of intensity, poli ticization self­
destructs : constant pol i tical activ i ty eventual ly enters in to contradiction 
with its own foundations.  

What, then, of the political status of space ? No sooner has space 
assumed a political character than its depoliticization appears on the 
agenda. A po l it icized space destroys the polit ical conditions that brought 
i t  about, because the management and appropr iat ion of such a space 
run counter to the state as well as to po l i tical parties; they cal l  for other 
forms of management - loosely speaking, for 'self-management' - of 
territoria l  units, towns, urban communit ies, regions, and so on.  Space 
thus exacerbates the conflict inherent in the pol i tical arena and in the 
state per se. It lends great impetus to the introduction of the anti­
polit ical into the political, and promotes a political critique which lends 
its we ight to the trend towards the self-destruction of the 'moment of 
pol itics'.

The hypothesis of an ult imate and preordained meaning of historical

of this process of becoming is the Ea rth , along with its resources and 
the objectives that i t  holds out. Formerly represented as Mother, the 
Earth appears today as the centre around which various (di fferentiated)

Confrontations and chal lenges to the establ ished order can always be 
attributed u l timately to the 'class struggle' I t  is no longer possible, 
however, to describe the frontiers a long which battles rage (both practi­
cal ly  and theoretica l ly speaking) as i f  they corresponded simply to the 
dividing-l ine between the territory of the rul ing class on the one hand 
and that of the exploited and oppressed classes on the other. The fact 
is that such disputed frontiers cross a l l  spheres, including the spheres of 
the sciences and of knowledge in general ,  and a l l  sectors of society, 
extrapolit ical as well as  polit ica l .  The great theoretical struggles have 
strategic objectives which I have sought to point up : reunification of 
what has been spl it apart, and effective discrimination o f  what has been 
purposeful ly confused. The separation of quantity from qual ity, and the 
attribution to space of a quantity devoid of qual ity, bespeak misdirection 
and confusion in connection with the 'nature' of qual i ties. And vice 
versa. Philosophy in its decl ine, stripped now of any dialectical dimen­
sion, serves as a bulwark as much for i l legitimate separations as for 
i l legi t imate confusions. 

The answer to separation and dispersion is unification, j ust as the 
answer to forced homogenization is the d iscernment of di fferences and 
their practical rea l ization . Struggles di rected towards these goals, 
whether implicit ly or explicit ly, are waged on many fronts - and along 
many frontiers; they need have no obvious l inks with each other; they 
may be violent or non-violent in character; and some combat the tend­
ency to separate whi le others combat the tendency to confuse. A politics

involve heightening the distinctions between 'project', 'plan' and 'pro­
gramme', or between 'model '  and 'way forward ' .  But it is far from 
certa in that such an approach would al low us to make forecasts or to 
generate what are referred to as 'concrete' proposals .  The project would 
sti l l  remain an abstract one. Though opposed to the abstraction of the 
dominant space, it would not transcend that space. Why ? Because the 
road of the 'concrete' leads via active theoretical and practical negation, 
via counter-projects or counter-plans. And hence via an active and 
massive intervention on the part of the ' interested parties ' .  

In  the course of our  discussion, we  have discerned a host of causes 
and reasons for the absence of any such intervention, none of them 
seemingly definitive. The progression of what might be ca l led a ' revol­
ution of space' (subsuming the 'urban revolution ' )  cannot be conceived 
of other than by analogy with the great peasant (agrarian) and industrial 
revolutions: sudden uprisings fol lowed by a hiatus, by a slow bui lding 
of pressure, and final ly by a renewed revolutionary outburst at a h igher 
level of consciousness and action - an outburst accompanied, too, by 
great inventiveness and creativity. 

The obstacles faced by counter-plans may be enumerated. The most 
serious is the fact that on one side, the side of power, there are ranged 
resources and strategies on a vast scale - the scale, ult imately, of the 
planet - whi le in opposition to these forces stand only the l imited , 
knowledge and l imited interests of genera l ly medium-sized or small 
territorial spheres ( in  France for example, regions such as Occitanie, the 
Landes coast and Brittany ) .  All the same, the necessary inventiveness 
can only spring from interaction between plans and counter-plans, pro­
jects and counter-projects. (Not that such interaction should be seen as 
excluding ripostes in kind to the violence of estab lished political powers . )  

The possibi l ity of working out  counter-projects, discussing them with 



420 O P E N I NGS A N D  C O N C L U S I O N S  
the 'authorities' and forcing those authorities to take them into account, 
is thus a gauge of ' rea l '  democracy . As for the frequently heard sugges­
tion that a choice must be made between ' reductionism' and 'global ism', 
between restricted and tota l action, this is the perfect example of a fa lse 
problem.

These thoughts offer a partial response to the first and last question : 
'How does the theory of space relate to the revolutionary movement as 
it exists today ? '  

A complete grasp of the theory and its essential articulations is necess­
ary in order to answer the question properly . It is thus worth recal l ing 
that the theory of space refuses to take the term 'space' in any trivial 
or unexamined sense, or to confl ate the space of  socia l  practice with 
space as understood by geographers, economists, and others. To accept 
any such conception of space, whether in the original  form or as rede­
fined by a particu lar discip l ine, is inevitably to view space as a tool 
or passive receptacle for the planners, with their talk of 'ha rmonious 
development', 'balance' and 'optimum use' . 

Space assumes a regulatory role when and to the extent that contradic­
tions - including the contradictions of space i tself - are resolved. 

Theory contributes to the dismantling of  existing society by exposing 
what gnaws at it from with in ,  from the core of its 'prosperity' As it 
expands, this society (neocapital ism or corporate capital ism) can gener­
ate only chaos in space. The bourgeoisie, though it has successfully 
learned how to resolve a number of contradictions inherited from his­
tory, managing to achieve a measure of control over markets ( something 
that Marx had not foreseen) ,  and hence a relatively rapid development 
of  the productive forces, will certainly not be able to resolve the contra­
dictions of space (that is, the contradictions of its space ) .  

The pol itical organizations of  today misconstrue or are ignorant of 
space and of  issues relating to space. Why ?  This  question has profound 
impl ications, for i t  pinpoints and defines the essence of the political. 
Polit ical organizations are bequeathed to us by history; they prolong 
history and maintain it ideological ly with their continual  commemor­
ations and reminders. And further than that they cannot go. 

But might what is misunderstood today not be perfectly well under­
stood tomorrow ? Might it not indeed be the potential centre of future 
thought and action ?

From the point of view of their respective approaches to space, the 
Soviet model and the 'Chinese road to social ism' represent an opposi tion 
that is tantamount to a contradiction . 

The Soviet model has as its starting-point a revision of the capita l ist 
p rocess of accumulation, coupled with a good intention - the desire to 
improve this process by speeding it up. This reinforced and intensified 
version of the capitalist model seeks to achieve rapid growth by relying 
on del iberately privi leged 'strong points' - on large-scale enterprises and 
cit ies . Al l  other places remain passive and peripheral rel ative to centres 
- centres of production, of wealth and of decision . The result is  the 
creation of points of concentration or vortices: the strong points grow 
ever stronger, the weak ever weaker. Such vortices are seen as having a 
regulatory role because, once establ ished, they ' function' automatical ly. 
Peripheral areas, meanwhile, abandoned to stagnation and ( re lative) 
backwardness, are more and more oppressed, controlled and exploited . 

The Len inist law of uneven growth and development is thus in no 
way dealt with, nor a re its negative effects countered. just the opposite, 
in fact. 

The
.
'�hines� roa� ' testifies to a rea l  co�c�rn�:w the p�ople an.cl space m Its entirety into the process of_l>ttttdmg a different society . Th is 

process is conceived of as a multidifuensional  one,  involving not only 
the production of wealth and economic growth but a lso the development 
and enrichment of social relationships - implying the production in 
space of a variety of goods as wel l as the production of space as a 
whole, the production of a space ever more effectively appropriated. 
The rift between strong and weak points would have no place in such 
a process. Uneven development would disappear or at least tend to 
disappear. This strategy means that political action will not result  in  the 
elevation of either the state or a political formation or party above 
society. Th is is the meaning generally given to the 'cultural revolution' .  
A further implication is dependence on agricu ltural towns, small or 
medium-sized, and on the whole range of production units, both agricul­
tural and industria l ,  from the smallest to the largest, but always with 
special attention being paid to the smal ler, even at the cost, i f  need be, 
of a slowing of the pace of production . This spatial orientation and 
strategy is designed to ensure ( barring accidents} that ,the dichotomy 
between town and country with its attendant conflicts will dissolve

thanks to a transformation of both poles rather than as a result of  their 
degeneration or mutual destruction.  

Th is is not of course to suggest that an industrial' country could purely 
and simply - and without any particu lar effort - opt for the path 
fol lowed by a predominantly agrarian one. I t  does show, however, that 
the theory of space is capable of accounting for revolutionary experience 
worldwide. 

Revolution was long defined either in terms of a political change at 
the level of the state or else in terms of the col lective or state ownership 
of the means of production as such (plant, equipment, industrial or 
agricu ltural entities ) .  Under either of these definitions, revolution was 
understood to imply the rational organization of production and the 
equal ly rational ized management of society as a whole. In fact, however, 
both the theory and the project involved here have degenerated into an 
ideology of growth which, i f  i t  is not actual ly al igned with bourgeois 
ideology, is closely akin to it. 

Today such l imited definitions of revolution no longer suffice. The 
transformation of society presupposes a col lective ownersh ip and man­
agement of  space founded on the permanent participation of the ' inter­
ested parties', with their multiple, varied and even contradictory inter­
ests. lt thus also presupposes confrontation - and indeed this has al ready 
emerged in the problems of the 'environment' ( along with the attendant 
dangers of co-optation and diversion ) .  

As  for the  orientation of the  process whose beginnings a rc  thus 
discern ible, we have sought to describe it above. lt is  an orientation that 
tends to surpass separations and dissociations, notably those between 
the work (wh ich is unique: an object bearing the stamp of a 'subject', 
of the creator or artist, and of a single, unrepeatable moment) and the 
product (which is repeatable :  the resu lt of repetitive gestures, hence 
reproducible, and capable u l timately of bringing about the automatic 
reproduction of social relationsh ips) . 

On the horizon, then, at the furthest edge of the possible, it is a 
matter of producing the space of the human species - the col lective 
(generic) work of the species - on the model of what used to be cal led 
'art' ; indeed, it is sti l l  so called, but art no longer has any meaning at 
the level of an 'object' isolated by and for the individual .  

The creation (or production) of a planet-wide space as the social 
foundation of a transformed everyday l i fe open to myriad possibili ties 
- such is the dawn now beginning to break on the far horizon. This is 
the same dawn as glimpsed by the great Utopians (who, inasmuch as 
they demonstrated real possibi l i ties, are perhaps not properly so

described ) :  by Fourier, Marx and Engels, whose dreams and imagin ings 
are as stimulating to theoretical thought as their concepts. 

I speak of an  orientation advisedly .  We are concerned with nothing 
more and nothing less than that. We are concerned with what might be 
cal led a 'sense ' :  an organ that perceives, a direction  that may be con­
ceived, and a directly l ived movement progressing towards the horizon. 
And we are concerned with nothing that even remotely resembles a 
system.

The publ ication of Henri Lefebvre's magisteria l  La production de l'es­
pace, in an excel lent English translation by Donald Nicholson-Smith, is 
cause for considerable celebration. Few of Lefebvre's voluminous works 
(see the appended l i st) have seen the l ight of day in English, as compared 
to other foreign languages, and the work and life of one of the great 
French intellectual activists of the twentieth century is consequently l i ttle 
known to Anglo-American audiences. 

Lefebvre was born in 190 1  in Hagetmau in the Pyrenees ( a  region to 
which he long remained attached and which was later to be the site of  
his sociological enquiries in to rural and peasant societies ) .  His mother 
was, according to his autobiography, passionately, even fanatically, 
Catholic, while his father was urbanely anticlerical - the sort of contra­
diction he was to rel ish for the rest of his l ife . His political as well as 
his intellectual consciousness was shaped by the experience of the First 
World War, the Russian Revolution and that maelstrom of intellectual 
change which he invokes in The Production of Space as follows: 

. . .  around 1 9 1 0  a certain space was shattered._ lt was the space 
of common sense, of knowledge, of social practice, of  political 
power, a space hitherto enshrined in everyday discourse, j ust as in 
abstract thought, as the environment of and channel for communi­
cations . Eucl idean and perspectivist space have disappeared as 
systems of reference, along with other former 'commonplaces' such 
as the town, history, paternity,  the tonal system in music, tra­
ditional moral i ty,  and so forth. Th is was a truly crucial moment. 

Lefebvre attended the Sorbonne during the 1 920s in a period of consider-



426 A�TERWORD 

able intel lectual effervescence and political turmoi l .  There he became 
one of a smal l  group of jeune philosophes who, revolting against what 
they saw as the anachronistic and polit ical ly irrelevant establ ishment 
philosophy of the time (personified by Bergson) ,  sought, largely through 
the pages of a radical journal, Philosophies, to redefine ph i losophical 
endeavours by means of intellectual encounters not only with the thought 
of Spinoza, Hegel and Nietzsche but also with the phi losophical work 
of Heidegger and Marx (whose col lected works were then in course of 
translation into French for the fi rst time ) .  Lefebvre and his companions 
refused to see phi losophy as an isolated or wholly special ized activity. 
They thought it important to grapple not only with the progress of 
science (the theory of relativity, for example) ,  but also with the qual ities 
of  dai ly l i fe - the quotidien, as Lefebvre called it both then and in many 
later works. Eighteen months of mil itary service in the wake of his 
opposition to France's colonial war in Morocco, fol lowed by two years 
earning a l iving as a taxi driver in Paris (an experience which deeply 
affected his thinking about the nature of space and urban l i fe ) ,  kept h im 
from any temptation to an ivory-tower conception of phi losophical 
work. 

The jeune philosophe was immediately attracted to the artistic and 
cultural avant-garde movements of the 1 920s. One of his first articles 
in Philosophies ( 1 924) was a portrai t  of Dada which, though not that 
compl imentary, was appreciative enough to bring him l i fetime friendship 
with one of  the leading figures of that movement, Tristan Tzara. His 
contacts with surrea lists l ike Breton and Aragon marked him for l ife 
and p layed a particularly important role after his break with the Commu­
nist Party in  1 956 .  His belief in the animating power of spectacle, of 
poetry, and of artistic practices became crucial in informing Lefebvre's 
attitude towards and active pa rticipation in the revolutionary movements 
of the 1 960s. 

Along with the other jeune philosophes, as well as many of the 
surreal ists, Lefebvre gradual ly moved towards the positions espoused 
by the Communist Party, eventual ly joining in 1 928,  the year before he 
took up a regular position as professeur de lyde first at  Privas ( far from 
Paris in the Ardeche) and later, in 1 932,  at  Montargis, which had the 
virtue of being much closer to the capital . His own adherence was to a 
large degree predicated upon a carefu l  study of Marx's early writings, 
a growing appreciation of the importance of dialectical and historical 
materialist method (as manifest in  Marx's Capital) , and a strong feel ing, 
much reinforced by the rise of fascism in Germany and elsewhere 
( including France ) ,  that collective resistance and international organiz-



AFITRWORD 42.7 
ation were essential for any progressive movement of the left. 

. 
His �a'.ly years in the �arty �er� marked both by mil itant or organiz­

mg act1v1 ty and by the mvesugauon of daily l i fe in various industrial 
sectors (such as the si lk industry in the region of Privas) .  Lefebvre 
was also preoccupied with the search for some kind of philosophical 
foundation or position that could be related to political practice. This 
proved no easy task, given the requirements and imperatives of the fight 
against fascism, the emergence of Popular Front politi cs in France and 
the growing Stal inism of the French Communist Party .  La conscience 
mystifiee, which he published with Herbert Guterman in 1 936,  examined 
Marx's conception of al ienation and the consciousness and politics 
which flowed therefrom, but was so badly received by the Party that 
Lefebvre was dissuaded from continuing with further volumes. His 
evaluation of Hitlerism was better received, as was his h ighly influential 
and widely disseminated expositional work on dia lectical material ism ,  
which first appeared in 1 93 9  and  which was seized and  burned during 
the Nazi occupation.  

By the outbreak of World War I I  he was already established as a 
major intel lectual figure in the French Communist movement. Fleeing 
Paris in the face of the Nazi occupation and then removed by the Vichy 
government from a teaching position he had procured at St  Etienne, he 
joined the Resistance, first in Marseilles and subsequently in the 
Pyrenees, in the val ley of Campan, where he mixed Resistance activities 
with deta iled studies of the l i fe and h istory of peasant society. These 
were to make his reputation as a sociologist in the post-war period and 
ultimately resu lted in La Vallee de. Campan, published in  1 963 .  

From 1 945 to  1 958 ,  Lefebvre remained with in  the  French Communist 
Party, but after a brief euphoric period in which he was widely regarded 
as the Party's  leading phi losopher (and used the weight of that position 
to attack, perhaps unwisely, what he saw as the unnecessary ideal ism 
of Sartre's existential ism), he found h imself in a tense confrontation 
with the Party 's resurgent Stalinism. For example, the French Party 
accepted Stal in 's  support of Lysenko's patently erroneous theories of 
plant breeding and criticised the use of the n�w high-yielding hybrid 
seeds then available from America as both bourgeois and counter­
revolutionary - a position which Lefebvre thought nonsensical ,  in  part 
for scientific reasons but also because he saw that by seeking to deny a 
source of extra productiv i ty to the peasantry, the Party would in the 
end destroy its credibi l ity with its peasant base (which duly happened 
in France, in contrast to Italy, where the Communists took a quite 
independent l ine) . 



428 A FT E R W O R D  

This was not, however, an uncreative period for Lefebvre. Taking on 
the role of popula rizer of Marxian ideas - a role he evident ly relished 
- he used his position as an established researcher with the government­
funded Centre National de Recherche Scientifique to publ ish a whole 
stream of critical but accessible evaluations of thinkers such as Descartes 
( 1 947) ,  Diderot ( 1 949) ,  Pascal ( two volumes in 1 949 and 1 954) ,  the 
romantic poet and dramatist Alfred de Musser ( 1 955 ) ,  Rabelais ( 1 955 )  
and Pignon ( 1 956 ) .  The point of these studies was not  on ly  to locate 
the thought and work of such creative wri ters in the material context 
of the day, but also to enquire into the creative potential ity of ideas and 
thought in history - a theme which was to become much more emphatic 
after he  left the Party. These studies were complementary to major works 
on dialectical material ism (a  multi-volume project, the fi rst volume of 
which appeared in  1 947 but which was then abandoned probably 
because of political pressures ) ,  Marxism , and 'the critique of everyday 
l i fe ' ,  (in which he again came perilously close to touching upon the 
themes of al ienation that had been so badly received in Communist 
circles with the publ ication of La conscience mystifiee in the 1 930s) .  

The break with the Party came in the wake of the publication of the 
Khruschev Report of 1 956 ,  which revealed many of the horrors of 
Stal in ism, but which the French Communist Party refused at first to 
acknowledge .  Lefebvre, having access to the report via German col­
leagues, entered into an internal oppositional movement with in  the Party 
and was ult imately excluded in 1 958 .  It is hard for most of us to 
understand what it might mean to be excluded from an organization to 
which one has belonged for some thirty years. The French Communist 
Party was not only a political party but the hub of its members' social 
and daily l i fe (it has sometimes been likened to an extended and very 
close-knit family structure ) .  Lefebvre effectively wrote his way out of 
the intense socia l  and psychological difficul ties generated by the break 
by writing La somme et le reste ( 1 959 ) ,  an autobiographical, autocritical, 
and evaluative summary of much of his own l i fe's work in the context 
of the times. 

Lefebvre did not leave the party by the right door but by the left. 
Liberated from Stal inist constraints, he could explore many of the ideas 
that had previously been latent by deepening his grasp and practice of 
Marx's dialectical method (a grasp which Jean-Paul Sartre described in 
his  Critique de la raison dialectique as 'beyond reproach ' ) ,  by exploring 
the history and sociology of dai ly l i fe (the origins of moderni ty, the 



A FITR W O R D  429 

structure of peasant  l i fe, the significance of the 'urban revolution ' ,  and 
the origins of the Paris Commune as an exemplar of the manner in 
which popular movements could crystal l ize into an overwhelming 
revolutionary force) ,  and continuing his  enquiry into the role of romanti­
cism, of  aesthetic experience, of poetic and cultural endeavours, and of 
individual creative thought in  revolutionary polit ics .  As a professor of 
sociology first at the University of Strasbourg ( 1 96 1-5 )  and then at 
Nanterre ( 1 965-73 ) ,  he argued against the structuralism of Althusser, 
the detachment from everyday l i fe manifest in Foucault, the pessimistic 
undercurrent entering French phi losophy through its engagement with 
Heidegger, and the h istoricism and scientism (positivism) becoming 
hegemonic i n  academic l i fe .  What marked him off from both the Marxist 
humanists ( l ike Sartre and Merleau-Ponty) and the structuralist Althus­
serians was his refusal to see any division between the work of the so­
cal led 'young Marx' ( lauded by the humanists and denigrated by the 
Althusserians) and the 'mature Marx '  (denigrated by the humanists and 
lauded by the Althusserians ) .  Life is lived as a project, Lefebvre insisted, 
and Marx's l i fe had to be seen as a total ity of interests, flowing concur­
rently rather than as fragmented pieces. From that stance, he fought 
to rescue dialectical material ism from the Marxists, h istory from the 
historians, the capacity for revolutionary action from the structural ists 
and the socia l from the sociologists. 

One of the key concepts he advanced in La somme et le reste, for 
example, was that of the 'moment' which he interpreted as fleeting but 
decisive sensations (of delight, surrender, disgust, surprise, horror, or 
outrage) which were somehow revelatory of the total ity of  possibi l i ties 
contained in daily existence. Such movements were ephemeral and would 
pass instantaneously into obl iv ion, but during their passage al l  manner 
of possibi l i ties - often decisive and sometimes revolutionary - stood to 
be both uncovered and achieved. 'Moments' were conceived of as points 
of rupture ,  of radical recognition of possibi l ities and intense euphoria .  
This idea was to be put  to work to understand subl ime moments of  
revolutionary fervour, such as the day the Paris Commune was decla red. 
It was also to shape the consciousness of many students in the uprising 
of 1 968 .  The doctrine foreshadowed and to some degree paral leled the 
ideas of the situationist movement which developed in  Paris in the late 
1950s. Lefebvre later fel l  out with the situationists. He provocatively 
though not altogether unfavourably depicted them as romantics whi le 
they accused h im of plagiarising their ideas to interpret the Commune 



430 AFTERWO R D  

and of fai l ing to  appreciate the revolutionary potential of their own 
tactic of creating 'situations' as opposed to what they saw as Lefebvre's 
more passive stance of experiencing 'moments' when they happened to 
arise. The continued engagement with s ituationist ideas (as represented, 
for example, in Guy Debord's La Societe du spectacle) seems to have 
had an important role. For example, Debord's critical observation that 
the 'moment', as Lefebvre initial ly conceived of it was purely tempora l, 
as opposed to the spatio-temporal ity of the 'situation', is tacitly coun­
tered in  Lefebvre's later works on urbanization and the production of  
space. 

Much of this seemingly theoretical and abstract argument was l ived 
out under the aegis of the student movement which culminated in the 
extraordinary 'moment' of May, 1 968 - a moment wh ich Lefebvre was 
to describe in intimate and reflective deta i l  in his L 'irruption, de Nanterre 
au sommet ( 1 968 ) .  Lefebvre is sometimes depicted as ' father' of that 
movement, and certainly the spark that fi red the thousand or so students 
who crammed into his lectures at Nanterre was important. The parallel 
between Marcuse's influence with in the student movement in the United 
States and Lefebvre's role in the French context is probably a reasonable 
one. Both were thinkers and long-time activi sts who had something 
important to say to a restless and dissa tisfied generation, but that is a 
far cry from crediting them with paternity of the entire event. 

The years after 1 968  were taken up with an intense enquiry into the 
nature of urbanization and the production of space. Seven books were 
written on these themes between 1 968 and 1 974, with La production 
de l'espace as the culminating work in the sequence. Lefebvre a lso co­
founded the journal Espace et Societe which brought together many 
distinguished young thinkers (the most well-known today being Manuel 
Castel ls )  who were insp ired by his interests. The two themes of  urbaniz­
ation and the production of space are interl inked in Lefebvre's thought. 
Increasingly during the 1 960s, and particularly th rough the events of 
1 968 ,  Lefebvre came to recognise the signi ficance of urban conditions 
of dai ly l i fe (as opposed to narrow concentration on work-place politics) 
as central in the evolution of revolutionary sentiments and politics. The 
sign ificance of the outbreak in Nanterre - a suburban un iversity close 
to the impoverished shanty-towns of the periphery - and the subsequent 
geography of street action in Paris itself, alerted h im to the way in which 
these kinds of polit ical struggle unfolded in a distinctively u rban space. 
But consideration of the urban question quickly led him to deny that 



AFTERWORD 43 1 
the city was any kind of meaningful entity in modern l i fe .. It had been 
superseded by a process of urbanization or, more generally, of the 
production of space, that was binding together the global and the local 1  
the  city and the  country, the centre and the  periphery, in  new and quite 
unfamil ia r  ways. Dai ly l ife, the topic that had engaged his attention 
before 1 968 ,  as well as Marxist theory and revolutionary politics, had 
to be reinterpreted aga inst th i s  background of a changing production 
of space. 

But i t  was characteristic of Lefebvre not to consider this purely from 
a technical , economic or even political standpoint, but to search for the 
ways in  which to interpret revolutionary action, to generate new forms 
of representation of the possible, against a background of social pro­
cesses that were redefining the very nature of human identity .  

The Production of Space is a book that broaches many such questions 
and does so from multiple angles. Lefebvre here draws upon his intimate 
knowledge of phi losophy, his reflections on Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche and 
Freud, his experiential encounters with poetry, art, song and carnival1 
his connections with the surreal ists and situationists, his intense involve­
ment in  Marxism both as a current of  thought and as a pol itical 
movement, his sociological enquiries into urban and rural conditions of 
l i fe, his particular conception of total i ty and dialectical method. The­
reader wil l  find here not only innumerable l ines of thought to be 
fol lowed up, but tacit or impl icit criticisms of structuralism, of critical 
theory and deconstruction, of semiotics, of Foucault's views on the body 
and power, and of Sartre's version of existential ism. Yet Lefebvre never 
rejects such formulations outright. He a lways engages with them in 
order to appropriate and transform the insights to be gained from them 
in new and creative ways. The book is, therefore, also an opening 
towards new possibi lities of thought and action.  Although the culmi­
nation of a l i fetime of engagement, The Production of Space takes the 
form of a prel iminary enquiry which contains much that is explosive, 
much that has the capacity to 'detonate' ( a  word he himself frequently 
choses)  a situation that threatens to become fixed, frozen and ossified. 
It is, above all, an intensely political document. 

Lefebvre insists that l i fe should be l ived as a project and that the only 
intel lectual and politica l project that makes sense is a l i fe .  The Pro­
duction of Space is by no means the end of that project, for he continues 
to write and work to this day. But it is a vital marker and one that 
deserves to be read widely and to be studied for the innumerable 
possibil ities it contains. 



432 AITERWORD 

A note on sources The two primary sources on Lefebvre's l i fe and 
work are his own autobiographical study, written in 1 959 ,  enti tled La 
somme et le reste, and the recent authorized biography, from which I 
have drawn extensively, by Remi Hess : Henri Lefebvre et /'aventure du 
siecle (Paris: Editions A. M. Merailie, 1 98 8 .
