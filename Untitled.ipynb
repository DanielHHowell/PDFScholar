Howell \\nDepartment of Neuroscience \\nUniversity of Texas at Austin \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINTRODUCTION \\n \\n\\nThe Muller-Lyer illusion is a well-known visual effect of involving length perception that many \\n\\n(when shown the effect) will indicate they are familiar with, or have seen in some form. The illusion is \\n\\ncomprised of two lines shown side-by-side, one with inward-facing ‘fins’, and the other with outward-\\n\\nfacing fins (as seen in Fig. 1 below). Subjects generally perceive the inward-facing arrow to be shorter \\n\\nthan the outward-facing one, when in reality they are of the same length or longer in a strong illusion \\n\\neffect.  \\n\\nThe central principle of the illusion is often claimed to result from “phenomena following (and \\n\\ncapable of revealing) rules governing non-illusory perception”, in which there is an “ inappropriate use \\n\\nof mechanisms normally responsible for accurate perception” (Warren 1976). Our depth perception and \\n\\nability to estimate distances has potentially entrained us to perceive divergent outward facing line pairs \\n\\nas marking the border of a receding object, and vice versa. While many alternative causes for the effect \\n\\nhave been proposed (Blyth et al. 1967, Erlebacher & Sekular 1969), the goal of this present paper is to \\n\\nsimply elucidate at least two factors that determine the magnitude of illusion in two different test \\n\\nsubjects. These two manipulated factors are the ‘angulature’ of the stimulus presentation, as well as the \\n\\nprocedural instruction for decision determining. While there are other definite factors involved \\n\\n(discussed later), these two considerations are expected to have a visible effect.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 1 - The Basic Müller-Lyer Effect \\n\\nOn the left, the line with the inward-facing fins appears to be shorter than the line with the outward-facing fins on \\n\\nthe right - when they are in fact of equal length.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \\n \\n\\nThe entirety of the experiment was conducted and analyzed within MATLAB. A prepared script \\n\\nfor this specific visual illusion was utilized, with individual parameters adjusted by the researchers for \\n\\nthis experiment’s design. Each of the two subjects participated in eight trials employing four different \\n\\nangles in the illusion across two different experimental instructions (‘slow’ and ‘fast’). Sixteen trials \\n\\nwere conducted in total.  \\n\\nIn the ‘slow’ trials, subjects were instructed to take some time (not exceeding a few seconds or \\n\\nusing any other method besides visual estimation) to discern the longer line before responding. In this \\n\\nway participants could reflect on the immediate perception. In the ‘fast’ trials, subjects were instructed \\n\\nto respond as fast as possible (within one second) as to which line they believed to be longer. Time was \\n\\nnot actually recorded as the differing instructions mainly served to frame the expectation of the subjects \\n\\nand separate immediate reactions from reflection. Throughout all trials the line pairs were shown with a \\n\\nvarying degree of vertical offset in an attempt to require the subjects to estimate length with other visual \\n\\ncues besides direct horizontal comparison. Angular adjustments took on the form of the arrows \\n\\ndisplayed below (Fig. 2) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 2 - Tests Varying Angles \\n\\nFour angles were used across the trials, with angular distance as measured from the horizontal; perpendicular to \\n\\nthe central line component of the figure. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION   \\n\\n  \\n\\n Analysis was done by obtaining a graph for each of the 16 trials, plotting how successfully the \\n\\nsubject identified the test arrow (with the inward-facing fins) as longer when that was the case. This is \\n\\nshown in black, overlaid with a fitted sinusoidal curve for the data shown in red. Also shown is the point \\n\\nof subjective equality (PSE), which can be utilized as a reference for the point in which there is an \\n\\nevenly divided split in responses when the line lengths are indeed equal.  \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3 – Analysis For \\n\\nTest Subject MC \\n\\n \\n\\nA) Trial data for an angle \\n\\nof 0 degrees and the ‘fast’ \\n\\ninstruction.

In trials of 0 degrees that \\n\\ndisplay perpendicular lines, there exists the steepest curve fit out of all the graphs with negligible \\n\\ndifference between fast and slow trials (Fig. 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B). This indicates that in almost all instances \\n\\nin which the test arrow (indistinguishable as such) was longer, it was successfully identified accordingly. \\n\\nThe 30 degrees trials exhibited a slight decrease in slope fit, with the effect of the illusion most \\n\\nprominently seen in the fast trial test subject DH (Fig. 4C). However, the trials showing the greatest \\n\\nillusion effect even when accounting for decision speed and test subject is that of 45 degrees – the \\n\\nstandard angle utilized when portraying the illusion. The 60 degrees trials most closely resembled that of \\n\\nthe 30 degrees trials, having a less powerful yet noticeable illusion effect, except in the trial of MC/slow \\n\\nin which the lines were seemingly distinguished with accuracy.  \\n\\n It is sensible that the 45 degrees trials exhibited the largest illusion effect, as this the midpoint in \\n\\nwhich the fins are furthest from both the real reference point of the line shaft, and the artificial reference \\n\\nof the perpendicular. While there does exist some noise in the data (e.g Fig. 4A), this conclusion can at \\n\\nleast be said with some degree of certainty based on the graph plots.  \\n\\n Besides these two tested factors, there likely exist many more relevant ones in determining \\n\\nillusion magnitude. Some examples for this in potential future investigations include varying: the \\n\\nhorizontal displacement of the lines, the length of the fins themselves, and the color of the lines (either \\n\\ncompletely or by components). One important factor for any variation of this experiment is the tendency \\n\\nfor subjects performance to improve through time the more trials they perform, being called a “special \\n\\ncase of the habituation paradigm” (Mountjoy 1958). To  prevent this, subjects should perform trials all \\n\\nin a single session, for as minimal a total amount of time as necessary. An additional complicating factor \\n\\nis the sheer popularity of the illusion, the awareness of which could induce a test subject to either \\n\\nknowingly or (more likely) subconsciously identify the test arrow with higher scrutiny.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nREFERENCES \\n\\n \\n\\nBlyth, Helen, Marshall H.

No matter how spiritually enlightened, cheerful, generous or creative you may be, if you have to live in the towns and cities of the world, go to its schools, travel its roads, eat its food, work in its factories and offices, use its hospitals and courts, not only can you do very little with personal or psychological freedom, it is eroded, cheapened and co-opted by its presence in the sys-tem. On the other hand it is useless to change the world while people remain essentially fearful, confused, violent and selfish. Not that people are essentially bad; but anxiety, insensitivity, cruelty and egoism are nearly always successful at resisting the healthy, the natural, the convivial and the fair. You don’t need a sociologist, a psychologist, a historian or an anthropologist to tell you that men and women are exceptionally good at making a prison out of their freedom.',\n",

People tend to resolve this problem (if they are aware of it at all) by coming down on one side or the other. A prototypical world-changer — a committed socialist perhaps — might say that mysticism, psychotherapy, psychedelic drug use, even art — are kind of frivolous, self-indulgent; at best of private, personal value or even, in the service of socialism, of collective use; but, in the end, we’ll never really be happy until society has changed, until it allows us to express ourselves freely, cooperate creatively and reach our full potential. Until then we’ll always be frustrated. A prototypical self-changer — a hippy, let’s say, in the original sense, or a mystic — might say that faffing about with democracy, riots, unions, activism or revolt changes, essentially, next to nothing. The same groupthink prevails in radical organisations, the same bitchiness, the same dull scripts, the same debilitating compromise and the end results are always, essentially, the same. Changing the world without first changing your mind is the quintessence of futility and doomed to failure. ',\n",

We may know that something is very wrong with the world we have made, but it reaches so deeply into our experience that when it comes under radical criticism, we defend and excuse it as an extension of our own selves. The myths of the world are our own, and to expose them is to expose ourselves.

These two events seem to be, at first glance, quite contrary,1 but the myths and philosophies of the ancient Greek thinkers, and those of the psychopathic old man who ruled over Judea were, in all important points, identical. Jahweh and his Patriarchs, Plato, Aristotle and most of the writers celebrated by classical Greek and Jewish society, hated women, nature, foreigners and ordinary people, and declared that the real world — the earth that is — was devoid of the living mystery which earlier ‘backwards’ people had worshipped. Greek and Jewish myths  are both comprised of psychotic child-men rampaging their way around the world, raping and murdering on the flimsiest of pretexts. We call these stories ‘classics’. Greek and Jewish societies also had a veritable obsession with law, which overtook regal — and usually despotic — whim as the means by which society, and by extension, the entire scientific universe, was to be governed. It was through this intensely abstracted reality of the Greeks and the Jews — an abstract rational system, an abstract deity in a distant abstract heaven and an abstract, utterly impersonal, law to which all are equally sub-mitted — that what we understand as ‘science,’ was able to overtake, and then deride, superstition; and what we call ‘democracy’ supplanted monarchy2.

The first technique was usurious debt, first invented by Mesopotamian kings and priests in the third millennium bc to impoverish and enslave their people, but en-thusiastically taken up by almost every ‘civilisation’ which followed.

This technique, for all its potential use and beauty, stimulated a dis-astrous change in consciousness amongst those who had access to it, who began to see inspiration not as a direct experience or mysterious flow, but as a function of memory; meaning not as an inherent quality, but as a series of words; and society not as some-thing which man has direct contextual access to, but as something which comes to him through the reading mind.

Subservience to the clock was unknown outside of monasteries, death was viewed as a lifelong companion rather than a time-obsessed ‘reaper’, madness was rarely a pretext for exclusion and even gender relations, despite many horrendous exceptions, were reasonably egalitarian. Medieval men and women were also, particularly in the later middle-ages, an inspiring, heretical and anarchic pain in the feudal arse2. There was, of course, sickness, warfare and the psychological miseries of religion, especially towards the end of the period when something like hell descended on the feudal world in Western Europe, but exploitation such as was prac-ticed before, in Imperial Rome say, or after, in Victorian England, was relatively low; poverty, the kind that, for example, modern Indians are familiar with, was relatively rare and radical rebellion, the kind that twentieth century Spanish anarchists and European hippies could only dream of, was relatively common.3',\n",

These processes, by externalising or ignoring anything not relevant to the task at hand, inevitably distorted, degraded or destroyed everything they came into contact with. Cotton mills produced more cheap cotton, while devastating local communities, schools produced more compliant workers while terminally corrupting their initiative and sensitivity, farms produced more food while stripping the soil of nutrients and eliminating the wild, gadgets produced more ‘saved time’ while multiplying the work required to build them, and so on. Every technologi-cal innovation since has solved one set of isolated problems while producing multiple sets of new problems for which more technical processes are developed to solve. Much fanfare accompanies each new solution — plastic, nuclear fission, high-speed travel, ge-netic engineering, the internet — or each new prospective solution — smart drugs, virtual reality, cybernetics, nanotechnology, nuclear fusion — while the disastrous pollution, boredom, sickness and madness which they cause are excused, ignored or exploited as new possibilities for technological progress.',\n",
       " 'By the close of the capitalist era the technical approach to life1 had separated itself from human culture and dominated material life on earth. Over the course of the twentieth century this dominance would spread to every aspect of human and natural experience; for the technical approach was not just restricted to the construction of powerful machines, the harnessing of new forms of energy, the refinement of methods of control or the manufacture of merchandise2, but was applied to the full range of natural and human life; indeed it had to be applied to everything because anything which is independent to rational restructuring, impedes or threatens output. Technical develop-ment of one aspect of the system, in one place, demands concomitant development in those aspects that supply its inputs and relieve its outputs. A high-tech factory cannot be developed unless there are high-tech supplies, arriving at high-tech speeds and processed by high-tech employees. These employees are no longer allowed to discover their own style of work, train themselves or live the kind of life they want to, but must be entirely integrated into scientific techniques of programming proven to produce the most speed, power, efficiency, accuracy or whatever the desired output happens to be. The same pressures are applied to literally every human endeavour. Whether you are a sportsman, a potter, a programmer, a singer, a road-sweeper or a police-officer, you are not permitted to go at your own pace, to work out for yourself how to work, to create from your own experience or inspiration, to do as you please, when you please or, God-help you, to wonder why you are working as you do, to what end. Independence of thought, action or even feeling is not an option, considering the distant or long-term effects of your activity is not an option, any practice or reality which cannot be assimi-lated to techniques of maximum control, productivity and efficiency3 is not an option.',\n",

It is ultimately meaningless to speculate on how the internet has changed human life, or analyse the influence of ‘Big Pharma,’ or attempt to diagnose the problems with ‘our education system;’ just as it is ultimately futile to reform prisons, or ban plastic bags, or sign petitions; just as it is ultimately useless to oppose the domination of energy companies, medical professionals or state bureaucracy over human life by powering your house with a wood-stove, self-medicating or deleting your Facebook account and tearing up your passport. This isn’t to say that it is meaningless, useless and futile to investigate or try to solve or circumvent these problems at all.

The teacher, for example, must separate the child from his home, his society, his natural milieu and the extraor-dinary complexity and subtlety of his own life and character, apply fixed inputs to the child’s attention (the various books, tests and projects of the syllabus, augmented by whatever games, trips and ‘experiences’ the school or teacher can add, either officially or pro bono) in order to obtain a desired output; namely integration into the system. Doctors work in the same way, as do scientists, lawyers, social workers, politicians, managers, designers, plumbers, farmers, kitchen porters… everyone.',\n",

They aren’t trained to do so, and if they do step beyond their allotted roles, they inevitably tread on the toes of someone [else] whose entire life depends on the power they exert over their specialised task.

In this sense, the system is entirely auton-omous and self-directed; its prime directive being the only one which an autonomous machine can conceive of; grow, expand, reproduce. Never die. Men and women own or manage various parts of the system, but the only actions which the system allows them to take are those which promote its ceaseless growth. Likewise only those who instinctively promote these actions, who have been accustomed to the systemic way of life since childhood, are promoted into positions where they can ‘freely’ make the right decisions. The system automatically creates filters to remove ‘trouble-makers’ from the path to positions of influence.

Finan-cialisation has led to enormous amounts of money sloshing around the higher levels of the system which, in turn, has led to, effectively, a feudal network of favours, kickbacks and sinecures; means to keep friends, family and other allies well remunerated while, effectively, doing nothing:1 Large corporations have long depended on government support via military spending, tax-breaks, tax-credits, favourable legislation, state-spon-sored r&d and bailouts during depressions and recessions; which is, effectively, a form of state-sponsored socialism for the rich. And the system frequently demands extreme forms of authoritarianism which, particularly under duress, are indistinguishable from fascism and totalitarianism.',\n",

The ‘capitalism’ of today is radically different to the one dissected by Marx, which is why some of his key predictions did not come to pass. He had no idea that the entire world, up to and including the psyche of everyone in it. would become a ‘means of production,’ nor that, consequently, the working-class would become almost completely subdued and domesticated. This is partly why today’s capitalism is now frequently referred to as late-stage, or sometimes neo-liberal. But if we accept that these terms refer to the latest and greatest stage of a project which has been ongoing for at least ten millennia — if we are to understand the entire process — we need a term which encompasses it. Although, as we shall see, it is also problematic, there is no tool better suited to the task than the system, a term which simultaneously refers to civi-lisation in toto, and the prevailing, encompassing, hyper-sophisticated, post-capitalist world-order we find ourselves in today.

The human world which economics claims to model, is, however, not reducible to ideas in the same way, nor, even if it were, can it be studied using the same experimental method scientists use on physical phenomena.

Contemporary ‘neo-classical’ economics, for example, examines exclusively abstract models (empirical facts rarely appear) which assume that all people have the same measurable tastes (which amounts to assuming there is only one person in society) and that these tastes remain the same under radically different conditions (which amounts to assuming there is only one commodity)1.

In order to maintain and justify the abyss of degradation that this inevitably leads to — mass poverty, exploitation, despo-liation, anything to scrape together enough to make the next payment to the swelling monstrosity that the lender was fast becoming — a moral duty to repay debts had to be impressed on borrowers; an understanding not just that they owed tribute to this or that lender, but that the universe itself is a debtor-creditor arrangement.

They want people who have no power to believe, because they have an exalted job-title, a mortgage, a degree, an iphone or shares in Wal-Mart, that ‘we are all middle-class now,’ or that class is a quaint out-of-date idea; of interest to Marxists perhaps, or to the English, but inapplicable in the ‘real’ world.

Nothing horrifies power more than the prospect of power-based class solidarity1 — hence the tolerance, even promotion, of identity-based class solidarity — the formation and celebration of ‘communities,’ and concerted initiatives to grant them equal status within the system.

Only a lunatic Nazi could oppose such initiatives.

An entire country — everything living within it — thus compelled to produce for profit and consume from the market — transformed into things to be grown, harvested, refined, transported, packaged, sold and consumed — inevitably led to extraordinary suffering, massive over-production, depletion of resources and un-heard of financial power for the new wealth-generating class of  centralised industrialists, which in turn led to both the power and the necessity to subjugate domestic peoples, expand markets into (i.e. steal resources from) overseas territories, and go to war with competing nations which, in order to keep up with England, all had to do the same.3',\n",

Imagine for a moment we removed all legislation which exists solely to protect class-power, and then we dispensed with all those laws that guidelines, custom and man’s innate sense of fairness can far better deal with than the vast, lumbering, context-immune and largely corrupt bureaucratic machine of lawyers, law-courts, judges and prisons. Imagine it was impossible to accrue wealth through accumulating property, or power through dominating common resources. Imagine that there were no such thing as money (see myth 2), and that therefore rent, debt, destitution and the wretchedness that goes by the name of ‘work,’ simply could not exist (see myth 21). Would there be crime? The taboo of the law —  of ‘defenders of the law’ and that most untrustworthy class of human-being, the law-abider — is that the answer to this ques-tion could possibly be no. The law, we are told, protects us from injustice, suffering, inequality and ruin. That its purpose is to proliferate iniquity and, via hyper-rational standardisation of human-experience, control, is unmentionable; for the obvious reason that dealing with the actual cause of crime is not good for business. Money cannot be made by eradicating injustice, redistributing power, land and wealth, fostering self-re-liance, allowing ordinary people to take responsibility for their environment or freely shaping it to their needs or those of nature; and so defenders of the law must criminalise such activities and focus exclusively on the deleterious effects of living in monstrously unjust, stupefyingly boring, sickening, stupid and painful societies. Thus lawyers, thus law courts, thus police, thus prisons, which are to crime as doctors, psychologists and teachers are to pollution, madness and stupidity. ',\n",

These are permitted topics when talking about education. The purpose of being there at all is never considered. Just as you may criticise individ-ual politicians, ‘fat cats’ and corporations, but must never, ever, critically examine the system itself, so, in school, you are encouraged to question what the teacher says (at least in the ‘better’ schools you are), but to question the point of being in class at all is heresy; and to actually do something about your confinement — leave the class, study what you want, say what you feel — is intolerable; in fact, in many cases, it is a crime.

Schools and universities must, at all costs, be completely separated from society. The idea that students can meaningfully contribute to society, learn from those who do or rely on their own will to determine their development, is preposterous, utopian; because a total revolution of society would be required to ‘teach’ students in the manner that they have been ‘taught’ for millions of years, through their own inclination, and integrated with an educational society.',\n",

       " ' · is your sadness the terrible truth and your happiness a mask, or is your happiness the profound reality of your life and your sadness just a selfish episode? Is your difficult relationship with your lover causing you to be unhappy, or is your unhappiness making the relationship difficult? Is it your train that is leaving the station, or another train you can see moving through the window? Is it you, or is it the world?',\n",

       " 'O n the one hand it is impossible to change your personal life — how you (and others) feel, perceive, think and act — unless the institutions which shape and subordinate your life also change. No matter how spiritually enlightened, cheerful, generous or creative you may be, if you have to live in the towns and cities of the world, go to its schools, travel its roads, eat its food, work in its factories and offices, use its hospitals and courts, not only can you do very little with personal or psychological freedom, it is eroded, cheapened and co-opted by its presence in the sys-tem. On the other hand it is useless to change the world while people remain essentially fearful, confused, violent and selfish. Not that people are essentially bad; but anxiety, insensitivity, cruelty and egoism are nearly always successful at resisting the healthy, the natural, the convivial and the fair. You don’t need a sociologist, a psychologist, a historian or an anthropologist to tell you that men and women are exceptionally good at making a prison out of their freedom.',\n",
       " 'This is the revolutionary’s paradox; a classic case of scentation. Is the problem out there, or is it in here? Do I change the world, or change myself? People tend to resolve this problem (if they are aware of it at all) by coming down on one side or the other. A prototypical world-changer — a committed socialist perhaps — might say that mysticism, psychotherapy, psychedelic drug use, even art — are kind of frivolous, self-indulgent; at best of private, personal value or even, in the service of socialism, of collective use; but, in the end, we’ll never really be happy until society has changed, until it allows us to express ourselves freely, cooperate creatively and reach our full potential. Until then we’ll always be frustrated. A prototypical self-changer — a hippy, let’s say, in the original sense, or a mystic — might say that faffing about with democracy, riots, unions, activism or revolt changes, essentially, next to nothing. The same groupthink prevails in radical organisations, the same bitchiness, the same dull scripts, the same debilitating compromise and the end results are always, essentially, the same. Changing the world without first changing your mind is the quintessence of futility and doomed to failure. Taken as a whole these two books, 33 Myths of the System and 33 Myths of the Ego, make the case that both positions are wrong, and both are correct. Until the dissident uncovers the radical reality of his personal life he will never change the world. Until the mystic uncovers the radical reality of social life she will never change her self. To perceive personality and society as they are is no easy matter though. They are stupen-dously difficult to experience directly; to understand how humans created and continue to create the world is like trying to understand a camera by peering at a photograph.',\n",
       " 'In a book like this, we can, of course, only look at ‘photographs’. My intention is to arrange them in such a way that the mechanism which produces them is seen more clearly, and in the seeing, a better camera comes into play.',\n",
       " 'T he system has been ten thousand years in the making. During that time it has taken many localised forms — autocratic, democratic, socialist, cap-italist — but despite superficial variations in structure and priorities, it has remained the same entity. It is now so sophisticated, so pervasive and so invasive, that it is almost impossible to perceive. We may know that something is very wrong with the world we have made, but it reaches so deeply into our experience that when it comes under radical criticism, we defend and excuse it as an extension of our own selves. The myths of the world are our own, and to expose them is to expose ourselves. Even, as we shall see, to read the words ‘the system’ can be enough to provoke discomfort, the sense of being under attack, or the feeling that the person using the term is an angry or immature misfit.',\n",
       " 'Chances are though you are aware that something is dreadfully wrong, that the world increasingly resembles hell on earth, that it is rapidly cracking up and that we need a revolutionary alternative. This book is an endeavour to strengthen this insight and to deepen it; to show that the problem is far worse (and, by implication, the solu-tion) is far more radical than is currently and commonly supposed.',\n",
       " 'Although brief, I have attempted to outline the entire system; which means that some of what follows may seem obvious and quite right, and some not at all obvious; or dead wrong. Many people have a tendency to complain about the State of the World, but to keep one part of it — the part they are most dependent on — immune to criticism; this is the part I urge you to look for, and to have patience with those chapters that you are sympathetic to or familiar with.',\n",
       " 'One final note. This book is largely based on the idea that there is no fundamental difference between the left and the right. I criticise both, and in order to do so I occa-sionally draw on leftist critique of the right, and vice versa. This does not mean that I support any other ideas, much less the entire philosophy, of the authors I quote or reference (or the publications they write for), with the possible exception of Snufkin.',\n",

       " 'F or hundreds of thousands of years, people lived well in peaceful, egalitar-ian, healthy societies, at the very least in comparison with what followed. We did not work particularly hard and the work itself (if it could be called work; pre-civilised societies don’t make distinctions between work and play), was enjoyable, meaningful and non-alienating. Activity is alienating if it makes you feel a stranger, or alien, to your own better nature, if you are forced to do it for someone else’s profit, for example, or for no good reason, or if you don’t feel ‘at home’ with its results. For most of human history (actually pre-history — properly speaking history begins with civilisation and writing) alienating work and ways of life were unknown; coercion and futility were inconceivable, as were property, religion, law, warfare, much superstition and what we could call ‘mental illness’. The fear of immediacy, when the senses sharp-en to deal with danger in the present, was part of life — because there has always been danger — but fear of tomorrow, the profound and widespread care, anxiety, and worry that modern men and women are burdened with, was unknown. Objectively it is impossible to know all this directly — but then it is impossible to know anything directly through study. Nevertheless, we can make some reasonably reliable inferences about our pre-historic past, just as we can about the surface of the sun or the outcome of climate change. Anthropologists can objectively assess what early people were like from studying soil, bones, tools and other archaeological remains, all of which indicate how early people lived, how violent they were, how healthy, how socially stratified and even what kind of universe they conceived themselves to be in.1',\n",
       " 'Anthropologists can also objectively, albeit approximately, determine the earliest state of mankind by looking at how hunter-gatherers live today. Nobody believes that foragers today are the same as those who lived twenty-thousand years ago; groups which have had no contact with the modern industrial world or with the pre-modern agricultural world no longer exist to study, but those which, at least until recently, sur-vived relatively independently all shared the attributes listed above. Naturally there is an enormous amount of variation in hunter-gatherer societies — far more than in any other kind of society — but generally the further away from civilisation, in time or space, the more egalitarianism, freedom and well-being, both psychological and social.2',\n",
       " '1    Take, as an example, warfare. Before around 10,000 bc there is (with a few debatable exceptions) hardly any evidence for warfare, and what there is clustered around the end of the Palaeolithic era. See Keith Otterbein’s review of Lawrence Keeley’s Origins of War), R. Brian Ferguson, Ten Points on War and War Before History and Fry, et al. War, Peace and Human Nature (which contains a thorough refutation of the  distortions of Steven Pinker). The same applies to inequality and ill-health.',\n",

See also Daniel Everett, Don’t Sleep There are There still remains, of course, a vast, impenetrable void at the heart of our objective knowledge of the distant past. We will never know, objectively, how people lived, felt and perceived for the countless dark millennia before civilisation appeared, blindingly over-lit. But if objective knowledge is notoriously limited and unreliable in matters that touch on human nature, where else are we to gain understanding from? Subjective knowledge is even more unreliable — plain deceptive in fact; it often amounts to little more than wishful thinking and emotional guesswork.',\n",
       " 'That there might be another mode of experience, an awareness of life that is neither objective — based on objects ‘out there’ — nor subjective — based on ideas and emotions ‘in here,’ is ruled out by the science, psychology, history, religion and art of the system and, with a language which inevitably reflects its and our concerns, almost impossible to express in ordinary speech. This panjective mode of experience forms the foundation of the companion volume, 33 Myths of the Ego. For now it is enough to note that there is a way we can penetrate human nature without recourse to either rational analysis or guesswork, but this mode of awareness is not available to either wishful thinkers or hyper-rationalists. The freedom and happiness of early society doesn’t mean there weren’t prob-lems — pain, frustration, hardship, danger and [increasing] violence — nor does it mean that we should up sticks and return to the trees. It means that what we call ‘progress’ has been, in terms of quality of life, peace of mind, collective joy and so on, a millennial decline. A few things certainly have improved — technique mostly — but these are almost entirely solutions to problems caused by ‘progress’.',\n",
       " 'This ‘progress’ began around twelve thousand years ago, when a catastrophe oc-curred in human consciousness and, consequently, in human society. Again, the nature of this catastrophe, or fall, is laid out in the 33 Myths of the Ego; here we shall confine ourselves to the demonstrable effects; social stratification, violence towards women and children, hostility towards nature, warfare, fear of death, superstition, shame, sexual suppression and extreme cultural mediocrity, all of which first appeared at the same time (around 10,000 bc) and in the same place (the Middle East / West Asia) with the beginning of the process we call history, civilisation or the system.',\n",

This life inhered in certain kinds of things — trees, clouds, rivers, animals and so on — as qualities, or characters, which were then integrated into myths. These stories mirrored the psychological experience of people, or of groups of people, in much the same way as dreams do; indirectly, metaphorically and strangely.',\n",
       " 'With the coming of the superstitious era these living qualities, and the myths by which they were shared, became objectified; which is to say cut off from fluid, contextual experience and integrated into an abstract mythic system, or [proto] religion. They also became saturated with extremely crude emotions; revolving around sex, violence and, the foundation of superstition, existential fear. Men and women had always been afraid of dangerous things in existence, but now they became fearful of existence itself, which became separated into two spheres; the reassuring, controllable known (the ideas and emotions of the self, ‘me and mine’) and its opposite, a disturbing-terrifying spectrum which ranged from the unknown (foreign people, new situations, etc.) to the unknowable (death, consciousness, nature, etc.).',\n",
       " 'The existential anxiety of superstition led, via the coercive absurdities of super-stitious shamanism, to the intense abstraction of priests and early [proto] scientists. Prior to 12,000 bc man had thought and reasoned, but now his thoughts began to take on a life of their own, began to seem more real and more important than reality, which now began to be shaped by the structure of thought. It was around this time that a series of interconnected events occurred which were to define the future of the world. 1. Cereals1 were domesticated and incorporated into new agricultural societies (in the Middle East). 2. Related to the rise of the cultivation of cereals, which are, uniquely, easy to tax (‘visible, divisible, assessable, storable, transportable and rationable’), small, hierarchical and centrally-managed states began to grow in the Middle East, which experienced population explosions.2 3. Larger urban areas and more intensive agriculture led to catastrophic deforesta-tion and even more catastrophic soil erosion, which led to the successive failure of the various states of classical civilisation, and to the climate of the near-east becoming drier and more hostile to human society.3',\n",

Diseases (such as flu, tb, diphtheria, smallpox, plague and typhus) became, through contact with domesticated animals, common.1 Life span dra-matically declined2 as did height and general health.',\n",

       " 'These events took millennia to unfold, spread and integrate with each other, but by the time we reach the third millennium bc the Bronze-age near-east resembled the modern world in every crucial respect. Mesopotamia, for example, was a place of widespread misery, constant warfare, ludicrous superstition, mediocre art, useful science, wasteful over-production, artificial scarcity, massive inequality (the ‘original 1%’) exploitation of society and nature, over-population, coercive rites, capital investment, standardisation, division of labour, time-pressure, usury and debt-peonage, taxation, prostitution, ill-health, wretched toil, iniquitous hierarchy, alienation, specialist professionals, slavery, devastating deforestation, soil erosion, repression of minorities, violent subjugation of women, children and outsiders, and rank insanity. This is what we call ‘the birth of civilisation’, an extraordinarily unpleasant state of affairs which everyone else on earth — the people known as barbarians — were desperate to avoid.',\n",
       " 'It is possible to chart the spread of this civilisation by following the parallel spread of myths which represent or justify the new state of affairs.3 These take the form of a fall from a pre-agricultural garden paradise, or age of gold, into a desacralised, sinful universe of  constant toil, presided over by a male sun god (Zeus, Jahweh, In-dra, Marduk, etc.) who vanquishes a dark and mysterious female or feminine ‘devil’, usually symbolised by a snake (Typhon, Satan, Vritra, Tiamet, etc.).

These two events seem to be, at first glance, quite contrary,1 but the myths and philosophies of the ancient Greek thinkers, and those of the psychopathic old man who ruled over Judea were, in all important points, identical. Jahweh and his Patriarchs, Plato, Aristotle and most of the writers celebrated by classical Greek and Jewish society, hated women, nature, foreigners and ordinary people, and declared that the real world — the earth that is — was devoid of the living mystery which earlier ‘backwards’ people had worshipped. Greek and Jewish myths  are both comprised of psychotic child-men rampaging their way around the world, raping and murdering on the flimsiest of pretexts. We call these stories ‘classics’. Greek and Jewish societies also had a veritable obsession with law, which overtook regal — and usually despotic — whim as the means by which society, and by extension, the entire scientific universe, was to be governed. It was through this intensely abstracted reality of the Greeks and the Jews — an abstract rational system, an abstract deity in a distant abstract heaven and an abstract, utterly impersonal, law to which all are equally sub-mitted — that what we understand as ‘science,’ was able to overtake, and then deride, superstition; and what we call ‘democracy’ supplanted monarchy2. That one nightmare had been supplanted by another, essentially identical, was as difficult to perceive then as it is now (see myth 22).',\n",
       " 'The dismal universe of the Greeks and Jews, conceived in both cases as one of cheerless labour and exclusion from paradise, was founded on the power of severing reality from the primary technique of systemic abstraction. This went hand-in-hand with the creation or development of three secondary techniques of control, exchange and communication which revolutionised the way people related to each other and to the universe. The first technique was usurious debt, first invented by Mesopotamian kings and priests in the third millennium bc to impoverish and enslave their people, but en-thusiastically taken up by almost every ‘civilisation’ which followed. So deeply had debt ingrained itself into the fabric of society that the religions of the Middle East began to reposition reality itself as a debtor-creditor relationship; the debtors, or sinners, being us and the creditor being the Bank of God, managed here on earth by his professional servants; accountants, managers and priests.',\n",
       " 'The second technology of control, invented by the Greeks, was money — an im-personal, indestructible, abstraction which rendered people, objects and, eventually, the 1    Like capitalism and communism: see myth 22. Note that a parallel development occurred around this time in China and India also. The entire period, usually called ‘the iron age’ or the ‘axial age,’ represents a massive intensification of the ‘civilised’ project across Eurasia; more specialisation, technology, rationality abstraction, professionalism… and horror. See John Zerzan, The Iron Grip of Civilisation.',\n",
       " '2  Before Homer and the Pentateuch, gods inhered in reality. After the Graeco-Judaic revolution they became separate from ordinary life, and the relationship between the two, between thing and god, became one of command; the beginning of science. ‘Abstraction stands in the same relationship to its objects as fate.’ Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment. entire universe as a collection of homogeneous quantities; things which could be bought and sold. It was thanks to the attitude that money engendered that Greek philosophers began to view the entire universe as a composite of discrete, rationally-apprehended particles (aka ‘atoms’) and ideas (or ‘platonic forms’), chief among them, the tragic atom — cut-off, isolated, alone — we call ‘man’.',\n",
       " 'The third revolutionary and coercive technology of civilisation, was alphabetic literacy, first developed by the Phoenicians but perfected and worshipped by the Greeks and Jews. This technique, for all its potential use and beauty, stimulated a dis-astrous change in consciousness amongst those who had access to it, who began to see inspiration not as a direct experience or mysterious flow, but as a function of memory; meaning not as an inherent quality, but as a series of words; and society not as some-thing which man has direct contextual access to, but as something which comes to him through the reading mind. Again — as would be the case with every epochal technology which followed — almost nobody saw that the powers being gained were at the expense of faculties withering; in this case, of sensate inspiration, contextual awareness and the ineffable music of speech.',\n",
       " 'These three techniques had three combined effects. Firstly they radically enhanced the separation of the individual from his or her context; as money-power requires no relationship to sustain it. Secondly, they intensified the isolated and isolating power of individual possession; as my things are no longer tied by tradition, or reciprocity to others. And thirdly, they created a belief, in all who came under the grip of debt, literacy and money, that reality is, ultimately, a mind-knowable, possessable, thing.',\n",
       " 'And so, by the time Greece ceded power to Rome (which, with the adoption of Christianity, fused Graeco-Judaism into one empire), all the basic components of a brutally subordinating mechanical civilisation were in place; intense social stratification, hostility towards the unknown, an abstract image of the universe which was taken to be real and a sense that money, mind, language and the cosmos are all similarly struc-tured — and equally significant — entities. All the consequences of such foundational attitudes were also in place; namely law and crime, armed forces and war, spectacle and boredom, religion and scientism, widespread suffering, loneliness, alienation, insanity and ecological ruin. These components, in various forms and combinations, continued to govern the affairs of men and women for the next thousand years in Europe, Asia, large parts of Africa and, eventually, in South America. Sometimes civilisations fell, such as Rome; an event greeted by relief and an im-provement in quality of life for ordinary people.1 Sometimes they were kept in check, 1    The so-called ‘collapse’ of many early states was often experienced as emancipation. Life outside the state could still be violent and precarious, but an end to oppressive taxation, serfdom, warfare, epidemics and all the horrors of civilisation at the very least did not necessarily lead to the brutal miseries its defenders are keen to present. See James C. Scott, Against the Grain and McAnany & Yoffee, Questioning Collapse. Likewise ‘defection’ or ‘going native’ — fleeing the state and joining ‘barbarian’ societies that were healthier, fairer and even more ordered — has been a common and persistent ‘problem’ throughout civilised history. ',\n",
       " 'such as Japan’s long history of successful independence, and less civilised social sys-tems could then reassert themselves. These systems, which we normally call feudal, although encouraging exploitation — sometimes extreme suffering — represented an overall improvement in the lives of ordinary people. The European medieval peasant, for example, was self-sufficient, had abundant access to common land, did non-alienating labour to an extremely high standard, and very often at an exceedingly leisurely pace, had a colossal number of holidays1 and had reasonably healthy social relations with his fellows, even those outside of his class. Subservience to the clock was unknown outside of monasteries, death was viewed as a lifelong companion rather than a time-obsessed ‘reaper’, madness was rarely a pretext for exclusion and even gender relations, despite many horrendous exceptions, were reasonably egalitarian. Medieval men and women were also, particularly in the later middle-ages, an inspiring, heretical and anarchic pain in the feudal arse2. There was, of course, sickness, warfare and the psychological miseries of religion, especially towards the end of the period when something like hell descended on the feudal world in Western Europe, but exploitation such as was prac-ticed before, in Imperial Rome say, or after, in Victorian England, was relatively low; poverty, the kind that, for example, modern Indians are familiar with, was relatively rare and radical rebellion, the kind that twentieth century Spanish anarchists and European hippies could only dream of, was relatively common.3',\n",
       " 'All this was to change. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a new form of the system arose; capitalism. In all essential aspects capitalism was a continuation and refinement of the civilised project that was conceived at the dawn of superstition, first made manifest in Mesopotamia and Egypt — the first societies to operate as if the people who comprise it were components of a mechanism — and then developed by Judea, Greece, Rome, China, the Abbasids, the Mongols, the Ottomans, the Spanish, the Dutch the British and the us. With each successive civilisation the social-machine was refined and improved.

By the end of the nineteenth century it had become clear that the creation of a ‘perfect’ global system was going to lead to the total annihilation of society in short order, and so measures were taken to, firstly, protect the labour force against its onslaught and, secondly, to appease the many revolutionary movements which had sprung up in an attempt to resist their horrific fate. The series of reforms that spanned the century between 1860 and 1960 succeeded in improving life for many, but with the deep foundations of the system ignored, and the common ground beneath those completely unperceived, the juggernaut of civilisa-tion rolled on, untroubled and undiminished — indeed in many ways strengthened by reform (see myth 31) — until what few brakes men and women had managed to install were, at the end of the twentieth century, ‘rolled back,’ so that the system could finish its business; the amalgamation of the people, ideas, emotions, techniques, tools, objects, behaviours and ‘natural resources’ (i.e. natural life) which comprise civilisation into a single, monolithic and entirely self-directing mechanism. Until the end of the capitalist phase of civilised progress, which lasted from approximately 1600 to 1900, the various elements of the system were still more or less subservient to nature, human nature and the culture that humans in groups naturally create. The advent of capitalism saw land, labour, energy and time commodified and assimilated with all the other components of civilisation into a multitude of rational-sci-entific-technological processes the sole purpose of which was the production of more output (profit, production, efficiency, etc.). These processes, by externalising or ignoring anything not relevant to the task at hand, inevitably distorted, degraded or destroyed everything they came into contact with. Cotton mills produced more cheap cotton, while devastating local communities, schools produced more compliant workers while terminally corrupting their initiative and sensitivity, farms produced more food while stripping the soil of nutrients and eliminating the wild, gadgets produced more ‘saved time’ while multiplying the work required to build them, and so on. Every technologi-cal innovation since has solved one set of isolated problems while producing multiple sets of new problems for which more technical processes are developed to solve. Much fanfare accompanies each new solution — plastic, nuclear fission, high-speed travel, ge-netic engineering, the internet — or each new prospective solution — smart drugs, virtual reality, cybernetics, nanotechnology, nuclear fusion — while the disastrous pollution, boredom, sickness and madness which they cause are excused, ignored or exploited as new possibilities for technological progress.',\n",
       " 'By the close of the capitalist era the technical approach to life1 had separated itself from human culture and dominated material life on earth. Over the course of the twentieth century this dominance would spread to every aspect of human and natural experience; for the technical approach was not just restricted to the construction of powerful machines, the harnessing of new forms of energy, the refinement of methods of control or the manufacture of merchandise2, but was applied to the full range of natural and human life; indeed it had to be applied to everything because anything which is independent to rational restructuring, impedes or threatens output. Technical develop-ment of one aspect of the system, in one place, demands concomitant development in those aspects that supply its inputs and relieve its outputs. A high-tech factory cannot be developed unless there are high-tech supplies, arriving at high-tech speeds and processed by high-tech employees. These employees are no longer allowed to discover their own style of work, train themselves or live the kind of life they want to, but must be entirely integrated into scientific techniques of programming proven to produce the most speed, power, efficiency, accuracy or whatever the desired output happens to be. The same pressures are applied to literally every human endeavour. Whether you are a sportsman, a potter, a programmer, a singer, a road-sweeper or a police-officer, you are not permitted to go at your own pace, to work out for yourself how to work, to create from your own experience or inspiration, to do as you please, when you please or, God-help you, to wonder why you are working as you do, to what end. Independence of thought, action or even feeling is not an option, considering the distant or long-term effects of your activity is not an option, any practice or reality which cannot be assimi-lated to techniques of maximum control, productivity and efficiency3 is not an option.',\n",

Politics, com-munication, transport, medicine, economics, academia, housing, food, entertainment, management and all work are integrated into a single system of interlocking processes. It is ultimately meaningless to speculate on how the internet has changed human life, or analyse the influence of ‘Big Pharma,’ or attempt to diagnose the problems with ‘our education system;’ just as it is ultimately futile to reform prisons, or ban plastic bags, or sign petitions; just as it is ultimately useless to oppose the domination of energy companies, medical professionals or state bureaucracy over human life by powering your house with a wood-stove, self-medicating or deleting your Facebook account and tearing up your passport. This isn’t to say that it is meaningless, useless and futile to investigate or try to solve or circumvent these problems at all. We are, after all, about to look at thirty-three aspects of the system, each addressed individually. What is mean-ingless, useless and futile is to tackle these aspects without reference to the system as a whole into which each element is inextricably integrated; and those who defend the 1   Aka ‘technique’.

Such people we normally call ‘specialists.’ The system more or less forces everyone to become a specialist, to treat separate parts of the universe as objects for technical manipulation. The teacher, for example, must separate the child from his home, his society, his natural milieu and the extraor-dinary complexity and subtlety of his own life and character, apply fixed inputs to the child’s attention (the various books, tests and projects of the syllabus, augmented by whatever games, trips and ‘experiences’ the school or teacher can add, either officially or pro bono) in order to obtain a desired output; namely integration into the system. Doctors work in the same way, as do scientists, lawyers, social workers, politicians, managers, designers, plumbers, farmers, kitchen porters… everyone.',\n",

They aren’t trained to do so, and if they do step beyond their allotted roles, they inevitably tread on the toes of someone [else] whose entire life depends on the power they exert over their specialised task.

In this sense, the system is entirely auton-omous and self-directed; its prime directive being the only one which an autonomous machine can conceive of; grow, expand, reproduce. Never die. Men and women own or manage various parts of the system, but the only actions which the system allows them to take are those which promote its ceaseless growth. Likewise only those who instinctively promote these actions, who have been accustomed to the systemic way of life since childhood, are promoted into positions where they can ‘freely’ make the right decisions. The system automatically creates filters to remove ‘trouble-makers’ from the path to positions of influence. If someone who is kindly, well-meaning or intelligent ever gains power, he finds himself completely impotent before the system, which will either do everything it can to expel his useless presence, or just allow him to bash his head against a brick wall until his supporters are disappointed and abandon him.  The pre-modern phase of the system was characterised, then, by the abstracted commodification of space, time and energy. Surveyors divided up the land, clocks divided up the day and the state divided up the people1, and all three were put on the market, where they were integrated into ever more sophisticated technologies of produc-1  Or ‘labour power’, which was no longer allowed to become independent as it was in feudalism.

The ‘capitalism’ of today is radically different to the one dissected by Marx, which is why some of his key predictions did not come to pass. He had no idea that the entire world, up to and including the psyche of everyone in it. would become a ‘means of production,’ nor that, consequently, the working-class would become almost completely subdued and domesticated. This is partly why today’s capitalism is now frequently referred to as late-stage, or sometimes neo-liberal. But if we accept that these terms refer to the latest and greatest stage of a project which has been ongoing for at least ten millennia — if we are to understand the entire process — we need a term which encompasses it. Although, as we shall see, it is also problematic, there is no tool better suited to the task than the system, a term which simultaneously refers to civi-lisation in toto, and the prevailing, encompassing, hyper-sophisticated, post-capitalist world-order we find ourselves in today. 1    A situation compounded manyfold by technical specialisation.

All natural forms are self-interested competitors for limited resources, genes are microscopic capitalists, and all evidence to the contrary is instantly rendered invisible or unscientific (see myth 23).

This word, ‘rational,’ is a key component of economic theory, for two reasons. Firstly, because economists, like all capitalists, believe that only the scientific method can reveal truth. If something is ‘unscientific’ it cannot be said to meaningfully exist. Thus, the opposite of rational must be ‘irrational’— insane, unreasonable or ridiculous.

The human world which economics claims to model, is, however, not reducible to ideas in the same way, nor, even if it were, can it be studied using the same experimental method scientists use on physical phenomena.

Money, Shakespeare’s ‘common whore of mankind,’ is the opposite of unique; it turns everything it touches into a sum and everyone who touches it into sum-maximisers, with one aim only: to get the best deal. For those with no character — no uniqueness, that is — this is no biggie; money cures all problems that want of character presents, except lack of love and the inevitability of death; but it provides the stimulating means to push those bad dreams from view also. There is one other thing in the universe that man can never get enough of, aside from sex, and that is thought, the sterile mother of money. Both are abstract, infinite and representative of everything; and so can never satiate the desire they generate. For money, like thought, there is no end, no death, no love, no kin, no quality, no context and so, no rest. There can never be an end to it, because there can never be a beginning. Where money comes from and what it really means do not exist, or at the very least do not have to.

That human beings and all of nature were not produced in order to be peddled in the market-place was as outlandish a notion for early capitalists as it is for their contemporary progeny, who are busily converting water, conversation, child-care, dating, family affection, consciousness and genomes into money-measured commodities.',\n",

This has forced economists to generate a secondary myth; The Myth of Inefficient Barter. According to Aristotle, Adam Smith, countless textbooks, academic papers and newspaper articles, money, and the market-system which uses it, arose because of the inefficiencies of ex-changing goods for goods. Apparently we used to live in a world in which a man with five chickens to sell had no way to get hold of a pair of shoes because the cobbler had chickens of his own; he had to go around barefoot until money was invented and he could sell to the chickenless blacksmith and buy a pair of shoes with the money.

We have come to believe that if we store money, not only will it, unlike substances in the real world, not decay, but it will actually increase in size. Yes! We have created life! Capitalists call the magical generative powers of stored money interest. Non-capitalists, who understand that this miracle money is coming from someone else, call it usury, a form of legalised theft which, like rent and taxation, is written into the fabric of Western civilisation. Usury means lending to make a profit on compound interest. The original debt accrues interest, and then not just the the debt, but the debt plus interest, accrues interest.  The debt doesn’t just grow, it grows exponentially. Basing, as we have, our society — in-deed our entire civilisation — on usurious debt, doesn’t just mean that we never have enough to repay, but what we do have to repay multiplies, like the fabled rice grain on the chess board, until it fills up the universe. In order to maintain and justify the abyss of degradation that this inevitably leads to — mass poverty, exploitation, despo-liation, anything to scrape together enough to make the next payment to the swelling monstrosity that the lender was fast becoming — a moral duty to repay debts had to be impressed on borrowers; an understanding not just that they owed tribute to this or that lender, but that the universe itself is a debtor-creditor arrangement. Human beings are born owing (aka sinful), and can never settle their accounts. When they inevitably betray the benevolent Gods-by-proxy who pay, feed, house and clothe them, they are then defined as ungrateful1, criminal or insane.

In the case of the enclosure of the common lands, which was going on from about 1600 to 1850, the land-grabbers did not even have the excuse of being foreign conquerors; they were quite frankly taking the heritage of their own countrymen, upon no sort of pretext except that they had the power to do so.’ George Orwell; although as James C. Scott explains, ‘lawyers’, in the form of land-surveyors, often preceded or circumvented the use of force.

The earliest ancestors of the noble families of Europe initially gained their power in this way, taking (or ‘clearing’) the land of their own country’s peoples, and then, during ‘the great work of subjuga-tion and conquest,1’ taking that inhabited or used by other peoples, a practice which has continued for hundreds of years and continues, in various forms, today; in Brazil, Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere.',\n",

Land cannot be compelled or tempted; it must be simply taken; or ‘privatised’ into ownership by forcibly establishing private-property rights and then buying it all up. Labour, however, is another matter. While pre-capi-talist and Orwellian states enslave and press-gang their people, capitalist mass-thieves have always understood that to gain control of people it is vital, not to mention easier, to use indirect mass-theft; impoverishment (the stick) and addiction (the carrot).',\n",

This forced people to become dependent on the technology, energy, transport-systems, bureaucratic credentials, high-tech channels of information, ‘landlords’ of intellectual property and ‘consumer goods’ of the system, which further hobbled self-sufficiency and broke up traditional networks of mutual aid. While the impoverished pre-modern or third-world worker cannot grow food on his own land, raise his family in his own home or make his own clothes and furniture, the impoverished modern worker cannot use his feet to go where he needs to go — he needs a car — use his mouth to communi-cate with his fellows — he needs a phone — use his own intelligence and experience to propagate knowledge — he needs the correct qualification or ‘a proven track-record’ in communications — or gain access to the artistic, scientific and cultural achievements of his fellows and forebears — he needs to pay patent and copyright owners.

That its purpose is to proliferate iniquity and, via hyper-rational standardisation of human-experience, control, is unmentionable; for the obvious reason that dealing with the actual cause of crime is not good for business. Money cannot be made by eradicating injustice, redistributing power, land and wealth, fostering self-re-liance, allowing ordinary people to take responsibility for their environment or freely shaping it to their needs or those of nature; and so defenders of the law must criminalise such activities and focus exclusively on the deleterious effects of living in monstrously unjust, stupefyingly boring, sickening, stupid and painful societies.

We cannot vote for a different system, ‘the gov-ernment always gets in’; we cannot vote against its expansion, against growth, progress or prosperity; and we cannot vote for anyone who can meaningfully change the system we do have.

If business suffers, it magically becomes ‘undemocratic’.',\n",

Democracy doesn’t just legitimise authority and provide a little hierarchical mobility within the system (see myth 5), but it usefully deflects revolt into manageable channels1. When decent folk with even moderate aspirations to make changes to the system enter democratic structures, they find they can achieve, effectively, nothing (Podemos, Syriza, Lula, etc, etc.). This was well understood by the industrial architects of the modern system who realised that the terrifying revolutionary power of the new urban working class could be moderated and dissipated by absorbing popular discontent into institutional hierarchies, particularly trade unions, the rise of which castrated early modern attempts to dismantle the system (see myth 31).',\n",

Some of the most appalling crimes against man and woman today are committed by allowing the system to replicate and organise itself shoddily and for its operations to unfold haphazardly, in agonising slowness. Those who can do something, simply don’t. Thus money and power roll up the Magic Mountain as the people who are deprived of both are ground down, dismantled piece by piece, without anybody ever being responsible, with nobody to blame, nobody even to be found.

Reformist critics (see myth 31) focus entirely on the subjects that are taught in school, how students’ progress is measured, teaching styles, classroom management, financial cost and so on and so forth. These are permitted topics when talking about education. The purpose of being there at all is never considered. Just as you may criticise individ-ual politicians, ‘fat cats’ and corporations, but must never, ever, critically examine the system itself, so, in school, you are encouraged to question what the teacher says (at least in the ‘better’ schools you are), but to question the point of being in class at all is heresy; and to actually do something about your confinement — leave the class, study what you want, say what you feel — is intolerable; in fact, in many cases, it is a crime. The purpose of education is to squash initiative, self-sufficiency and self-trust. The superficial means by which this is effected is through punishing any serious attempt to cross disciplines or to reject the syllabus which, by virtue of the fact that all socio-eco-nomic activity depends on the values and credentials it produces, makes all learning outside of its confines worse than useless; craft, self-knowledge, social responsibility and general non-credentialised competence, all become non-pedagogic in an intensely schooled system, and the entire world beyond the curriculum becomes non-educational, not to mention unreal (which partly explains the shock that graduates often get on their first encounter with it). Schools and universities must, at all costs, be completely separated from society. The idea that students can meaningfully contribute to society, learn from those who do or rely on their own will to determine their development, is preposterous, utopian; because a total revolution of society would be required to ‘teach’ students in the manner that they have been ‘taught’ for millions of years, through their own inclination, and integrated with an educational society.',\n",

This is because it needs to maintain a certain degree of criticality and experimental research among a minority, but must take care to channel this activity into narrowly compartmentalized utilitarian disciplines and avert any holistic critique and experimentation.

       " '‘I nnovative’ and ‘new’ are two of the most used words in the capitalist lexicon, but, as with ‘growth,’ ‘freedom,’ ‘democratic’ and ‘newsworthy’ innovative only really counts as innovative if it serves business. Capital seeks new answers to one question only; how to accumulate more capital. New ways to extract more work from more labour, new technologies to increase production or suppress dissent, new methods to fix people into the system, new inducements to buy more, new techniques of generating profits, new products, new markets and new marketing campaigns all represent the needs of the system and therefore the acceptable direction of innovation. The nature of the limits to systemic innovation is exposed in the contradiction that exists between ‘innovation’ and ‘risk’. In the literature of the system the word ‘risk’ always refers to minimising risk to the lowest possible levels, thereby ‘maximising return on investment’. Anything which cannot be predicted or controlled — autonomous choice, creative inspiration and all spontaneous natural and social processes — represents an enormous threat to the system and must be, at all costs, restrained or controlled. This is either achieved through direct compulsion — which is why capitalists always seek to control governments, which can indemnify risk and control those who upset capital by not paying their rents or turning up for work — or through indirect influence — by reshaping the environment1 to funnel awareness towards its priorities, forcing activity down canalised, controllable, predictable pathways. Genuinely free choice, inspiration, life itself, must be induced, only under such conditions are capitalists prepared to ‘take risks’ in a ‘free’ market.',\n",

Only such a monoworld (aka the interzone), one in which all compo-nents are comprehensible, predictable, controllable and interchangeable, is acceptable to the system.

Collective originality (aka ‘scenius’) is automatically suffocated by time-scarcity, absence of conviviality, digitisation of experience and other consequences of the expansion of the system into the cultural realm, which forces artists to depend upon the machinery of the system to realise their work. The culture industry, in turn, judges art by how suitable it is for the 1 Including, via advertising, media ownership and academic sponsorship, the intellectual and emotional system, pouring its energy into ensuring that system-friendly titles will be successful.

Murder and mayhem are fine, as is a little bit of controversy, but the serious suggestion, for example, that religion, scientism, feminism, capitalism, communism, nationalism, professionalism, sexism, consumption, mental illness, democracy or communications technology are bobbins will not sell, and so cannot be produced. Genuinely radical social criticism, which concentrates on laying bare the roots of social evils, is taboo among all publishers, producers and critics (‘too incendiary, too controversial, too angry’ or perhaps, ‘clichéd’), as is any work which crosses genres (‘falls between two stools’) as is any song, novel, film or work of art which expresses the nature of human life, as opposed to its systemic appearance and priorities (‘I like it, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to sell it’), as is any work that meaningfully suggests there might be a natural, social or existential reality beyond the self (‘I didn’t understand it’).',\n",

Ponderous imitation of nature is permitted, as is the sickening relativist sentiment of green and neo-green doomers, but natural majesty or harmony in artistic form are as rare in literature as the wild is in society and greeted with the same incomprehension.

In addition, such consumers are harried, stressed, lonely, working all day at meaningless tasks for the enrichment of others, living in ugly accommodation owned by others or bamboo-zled by a lifetime of emotional overstimulation, hyper abstraction, sensory deprivation, alienation, advertising or grinding poverty. Under such circumstances the eternal truth and apocalyptic beauty of great art and wild nature, their revolutionary harmony, subtlety and power, have either been co-opted, or they cannot be perceived at all. The organs to do so have withered; and even when the problem is grasped or the solution glimpsed, the energy required to do something about them, much less create enduring works of beauty oneself, is absent. Most people do not know what to do with free time and when it appears they feel only an anxious need to consume corporate fun or, at best, cultural familiarity.',\n",

As mentioned in myth 17, culture is no longer handed down ‘ver-tically’ from adults to children, but is now only passed ‘horizontally’. It can of course be a very good thing for children to reject the values of their elders, but for the young to break entirely with adults, to reject tradition completely — to dress, think, talk and act like other children — is a social disaster. The young no longer seek to express themselves through the long-evolved scenius of their cultures but through the tastes and preferences generated by cliques. That these are sterile and degraded is putting it mildly. Just take a look at the cultural icons of the youth — happily provided by corporate power — to get an idea of how far we have fallen in just forty years. And it will get much worse.',\n",

Children have no opportunity to play outside of artificial, mediated and intensely managed institutional or virtual environments. And nor do adults. Mad laughter, ‘inappropriate’ language, satire and uncensored play are banned in all workplaces everywhere, supplanted by ‘fun-days,’ ‘informal working spac-es’, ‘bonding exercises,’ ‘jolly good fellows’ and other market-friendly morale-boosters. Non-work play usually amounts to intoxication, competition or passive consumption of fun. Free cooperative creation, unmanaged joy and psychologically liberating ritu-al — the living foundation of collective genius — are now so far from most people’s experience that there is no need for centralised authority to bust the party; general awkwardness, apathy, confusion and the uptight distaste of the internal censor are far more effective police. We do not need the authorities to direct our behaviour when we have an inner voice which tells us that spending free time on anything but enhancing employability is frivolous ditz, that playing with other people’s children is tantamount to paedophilia, that spending a weekend engaged in improvised theatre in the forest is ‘not my thing’ or that being silly will expose you.

We have lived in such a cultural wasteland since the 1990s (although the death-blow was delivered at the beginning of the 80s). Since then, joy has given way to mere excitement, surreality to mere randomness, vividness to mere intensity and the superb mad laughter of working-class comedy has given way to the witless sniggering of bour-geois ‘comedy’2. The difference can no longer be detected because artists no longer have access to a reality which forces them to discern it. Those who would create the art we need are isolated from the harmony of lived nature and genuine culture, and can no longer detect its presence. Cultural ugliness and aesthetic squalor colonise the earth and come to seem normal, until the building of a great work of art comes to be as difficult, and as unlikely, as the building of a cathedral, while those who look back with longing at the cathedrals we once built appear hopelessly out-of-date.',\n",

Ego, feeding off the intellectual, moral and aesthetic fashions of the group that it huddles to for warmth, is terrified by anything which gestures to a reality beyond what it knows, and what it feels it knows. The unknown — originality, that is — always greets the ego as an incompatible known, which is to say, as some kind of violence, threat, offence, or some other kind of devil (see myth 25). It is instructive, in this regard, to read of the lives of Jesus of Nazareth, William Shakespeare1, J.S. Bach, Ludvig van Beethov-en, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Vincent Van Gogh, William Blake, William Turner, D.H. Lawrence and Friedrich Nietzsche; all of whom were rejected by those around them, passed in and out of fashion, and struggled for money, and all of whose works are now in the hands of critics, curators, auctioneers and other bourgeois guardians of culture; the dust people who haunt classical music recitals and fine art retrospectives.2 Ego will do everything in its power to protect itself against the reality that ge-nius represents; if that reality has the chance to get anywhere close to awareness. The unquenchable thirst that ego has for reflections of its own beliefs, desires and fears is enough to drive it away from genius and into the mountains of meaningless drivel (or meaningless pastries) that it consumes for reassurance. This reassurance it calls ‘pleasure,’ ‘fun’ or, if the object is that of a now safely dead, system-subsumed artist, ‘appreciation.’ Serious engagement with living genius and profound expressions of the inner life of the individual (as opposed to the mass or minority type) bores, offends, confuses, annoys and horrifies ego, which does everything in its power to make sure that it does not get in the way of its self.',\n",

       " 'The modern system may have seized on the technical power of science only recently, but the common root of system and science reaches as far down as the foun-dations of civilisation. All three — science, system and civilisation — were built on the mind’s ability to isolate subjects and objects from consciousness and context, represent those subjects and objects as abstractions and — in the tertiary process we normally call science — systematise those abstractions into testable narrative theories. The abstract world created by this ‘isolating-representing-systematising’ activity slowly became, as civilisation progressed, more and more useful, ‘accurate’ and, crucially, neat (internally coherent3) which served to conceal the fact that science has almost no bearing on or-dinary existence (life, death, love, creativity, beauty, self-knowledge and so on) which is far better served by myth, folk-knowledge and art and that, ultimately, the entire project of mind was founded on an illusion. The utility and factual accuracy of science conceals this truth; that the world as mind understands it was brought into existence by the activity of the mind.4 1 Ted Kaczynski, Industrial Society and Its Future. 2  ‘The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values’.

All of its dominating ideologies — superstitious, religious, philosophical and scientific — are founded on a world made by the mind and on the foundational belief that what the mind creates is real or that it is capable of apprehending reality. Thus shamans, priests, philosophers and scientists may believe different things, and violently disagree about their beliefs, but they all behave in exactly the same way; treating reality as a mind-knowable mechanism (operated by laws or by gods), conflating consciousness and thought,1 subordinating experience (what is actu-ally happening) to knowledge (what I know about what is happening) and widening the gulf between them, restricting access to knowledge or technique to the uninitiated, dressing up Big Men in gowns, dressing up language in jargon, taking metaphor (the scientific metaphor of measurement or the religious metaphor of myth) as factually true, completely dismissing the testimony of the individual, being reflexively outraged by attacks on orthodoxy, and either sucking up to power or monopolising it.',\n",
       " 'Because the ‘civilised’ hyper-literal mind has, on its own, no standard by which to judge that which precedes or transcends itself, any foundational experience of reality which is paradoxical, non-dualistic, qualitative or impossible to grasp with abstraction is automatically rejected as false, heretical or insane. God, says mind, is a literal thing, consciousness is a literal thing, matter is a literal thing, society is a collection of literal things, reality, or the context, is a collection of literal things, labour, land and life itself are literal things, and all these literal things relate to each other literally, in ways which mind can also reveal. Thus, to fit in with God’s plan, or to harmonise with the ‘natural’ order revealed by science, or to take your place in capitalist society, or to accede to professionally determined reality you — who are also a literal thing — must relate to them in the correct way. Any other approach is heresy, madness or pure fantasy to literal systemoids; to laws and lawyers, to cults and religious fundamentalists, to third-wave feminists (‘no means no’), to anti-racism extremists and modern leftists, to technophiles (and the social media they create or use), to standard psychology, to journalism (left and right), to management, to scientism, to postmodernism, to the ancient Greeks and their heirs, to batty conspiracy theorists (the moon was invented by the Bilderberg group to turn frogs gay) and to all chronically boring people everywhere.

This is why science concerns itself entirely with cause-and-effect, and why it is unable to explain anything of any importance (the creation of the universe, the origins of life, the nature of consciousness, the reality of death, how to write a timeless love song or what to do about a moody). Everything that happens is said to happen as the result of a prior, mind-isolated, event. Consciousness, the ineffable quality of existence, its freedom from all cause and its consequent responsibility (see myth 16) is intolerable to the mind-made world, and must be annihilated.

The universe, according to the ‘consensus,’ is a literal mechanism, nature is constant warfare and man is inherently egotistical; because those who form the consen-sus — predictable, belligerent, selfish types — can do nothing but go looking for literal mechanisms, conflict and reflections of the ‘reality’ they know.',\n",

Granted, there were heretical movements which challenged the doctrine of original sin (the so-called ‘Christian mystics’) as they did Darwinism (Lamarckism and Kropotkinian theories of mutual aid), as they do neo-Darwinism (Epigeneticists and Neo-Lamarckists), but somehow these ideas don’t quite make it onto the teevee.

Intelligent scientists are aware of the primary role that vague — sometimes thoughtless — coun-ter-inductive, counter-intuitive and even counter-rational passions and hunches play, not just in life generally, but in scientific discovery. They are aware of the catastrophic limits of scientific hyper-specialisation;3 the inherent limitation of obsessive focus on tinier and tinier compartments of knowledge, and the consequent fear that hyper-specialists, like all institutionalised people, have when faced with totalities, contexts or any kind of experience outside their narrow domain of expertise; the importance of which they tend to inflate to comic proportions. None of this means that science, abstract thought or intellectual specialisation are useless — they are the very essence of use, and only a fool discounts the technical knowledge, or the logical reasoning, that science and the specialised mind provide us with — nor does ‘based on faith’ mean entirely arbitrary and illusory; if reality were not somehow relative, mind-knowable and ‘factual,’ nothing that the mind understands would have any meaning. Clearly facts do exist and clearly the scientific mind can determine what they are; something which fools and liars (religion-ists, postmodernists, monogendroids, climate-change deniers, flat-earthers, mystic fluff-minds, revisionists, corporate employees, economists, politicians, and other believers in absurd conspiracy theories) are keen to deny or ignore.

Schizophrenia, ‘high-functioning autism’, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome, narcissism, borderline personality disorder and all addictions and phobias are not, ultimately, physical states; which is how they can be voted into existence by the psychiatric profession. Schizophrenia, for example, was invented by Eugen Blueler in 1907; based on the prior invention, in 1898, of dementia praecox by Emil Kraepelin. These men based their invention on behaviour, and on their beliefs about that behav-iour, not on changes in tissue caused by disease or any other discernible material fact. This is how every ‘mental illness’ which followed has been invented (discovered is the official term) — from homosexuality to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to the latest set of eating, non-compliant language and ‘oppositional defiant’ disorders. Such problems — and they are problems — may cause a physical alteration to the mind or the body, as learning the piano does, or playing computer games all day, but no causal link has ever been discovered between genes, nerves, tissues and mental disorder and, in most cases, no literal, physical correlation has been found at all. If they were discovered the patient would be passed over neurology; which is to say they would cease to become mental illnesses. Mental illnesses, as Tomas Szasz demonstrated from every conceivable angle for over forty years, do not exist, any more than dream illnesses exist. Problems certainly exist, unhappiness, despair, alienation and anxiety exist, selfishness and laziness exist; but they are not illnesses. They are automatically assumed to be physical illnesses by those who have a vested interest in ignoring the social and personal causes of psychological and behavioural problems. Such people fall into two broad groups. One group comprises those who are unwilling to live responsibly and meaningfully. These we call ‘mentally ill’ patients. The other group comprises those who have been granted enormous power over patients; wealth, status, exclusive access to diagnostic machinery and treatments, the power to drug and imprison people against their will and even the power to deter-mine what is real.

Secondly, related to this, their job is to place all responsibility for the frustrations of living in a punishingly inhuman world upon measurable elements of the human body (brain, genes, chemicals, genitals and whatnot). The idea that individ-ual consciousness, much less society, is responsible for human misery and rage must be annihilated. Thirdly, psychologists are employed by large corporations to make us buy more, which amounts to inducing a constant state of desire and anxiety in consumers; particularly young users of modern tech. Fourthly, alongside perfecting technologies and strategies of consumption, psychologists are employed by corporations and other institutions to control and select compliant operatives (‘gifted students,’ ‘team players,’ ‘boardroom material’ and the like). Next, related to this, the state employs psycholo-gists to refine methods of social control and to identify threats to the market system (face-recognition is currently the most heavily funded area of psychological research). The sixth job of psyche-professionals is to support state-military operations by enhancing the power of professional murderers (official term: soldiers) to kill and torture.

Men and women, in such a society, come to resemble self-informed caricatures of maleness and femaleness; the men being openly aggressive, hyper-rational, sexist, filthy and obsessed with domination and the women being vain, bitchy, utterly unreasonable, masochistic, physically feeble and obsessed with manip-ulation.

Man is denied all op-portunities to engage in his odyssey and woman is denied the capacity to embody, or to recognise, her inborn intelligence, let alone express it. A new form of madness begins to develop in which the entirely unnatural, or disembodied, thrives; the monogender.

As power spreads, and more and more people can afford to live an entirely egoic life, so monogendered character-istics and priorities begin to spread down to the middle classes; the middle men who organise the expanding system. In the most decadent phases of societies such as Greece and Rome such middle-men were still very few. In the modern world, they represent an enormous number of people.

Yet, oddly, they are unwilling to entertain the possibility that a world created by men, which forces everyone within it to act and think like men — insane men at that — masculinises women and estranges them from their embodied femininity.

       " 'As soon as women, homosexuals and racial minorities were fully admitted into the workplace, so feminism, lgbtiqacφ, anti-racism and disability-rights campaigns became integral elements of [late] capitalist ideology. But it is not simply as a capitalist advertising campaign, or in straightforward defence of group-power that criticism of any woman must now be rendered ‘sexist,’ or criticism of any black man ‘racist,’ or criticism of any politician ‘abusive,’ or criticism of the conceited, the selfish, the lazy or the stupid ‘ableist.’ There is another reason why modern capitalist states and corporations — the most dishonest, repressive and destructive organisations ever to have existed in human history — are scrupulously fair, respectful and tolerant in their use of language and publish guidelines on the correct language to use when referring to disabled people, women, ‘people of colour’ and members of the lgbtiqacφ ‘community;’ another reason why, although the global south is poorer than it has ever been, black people are more marginalised than they have ever been, ordinary people are more disabled than they have ever been (less able to use their legs to move, or use their mouths to speak and be heard, or use their hands to do things), and femininity is more rigidly suppressed than ever before; another reason why we are less able to use words that might offend women, the poor, black people or the disabled. Corporate power is hyper-vigilant about offensive language because, in order to conceal its inherent, implicit racism, sexism and classism, it must be scrupulously just in its formal, explicit speech and behaviour. There are two reasons for this; for taboos on ‘offensive language’ (on insulting prophets, calling girls ‘chicks’, rape-jokes and so on) and for continually decamping from one word to another ‘safer’ one (e.g. from ‘the n-word’, to ‘black’, to ‘person of colour’). Firstly, the sanctity of taboos upholds the religious belief upon which the sys-tem is founded; that words, ideas and emotions are as real as things and that a bad word can smite those who hear it senseless (particularly women for some reason) as if from a percussive blast (see myth 25). In this way can all the lies of the system, conjured from thin air, be given the material ground that credibility demands, while all intellectual criticism and verbal mockery be banished as acts of violence.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, taboos don’t just ignore the source of racism, sexism, etc, but, ulti-mately, they raise the wall between formality and informality higher. Children, friends and comedians will continue to use non-standard words, but we must now use the correct word in public. This actually serves power. Without the formal smokescreen of inoffensive language, the actual repression and bigotry of criminal state-corporate ac-tivity would be visible. Thus a standard matrix of prohibitions is employed to conceal capitalist power-relations and personal egoic insanity behind gentility. Only a stupid slave-owner uses racist language, only a drunk upper-manager calls his wage-slaves ‘plebs’ and only an ageing comedian calls women ‘birds.’ An elite, racist, sexist system is far better served by limitations on such language, for the same reason that the most abusive parents never explicitly suppress, belittle or even criticise their children.',\n",
       " 'This is how ‘racism,’ which actually means indiscriminate, prejudiced hatred of or violence towards an entire race (‘I can’t stand black / white people’) has come to mean bias, criticism or antipathy towards a group of people who are of the same race (‘I can’t stand those black / white people’). Wealthy and powerful people, and their sometimes well-meaning professional servants, seek to conflate the two in order to redefine popular resentment of their privilege into forms of racism. Thus criticism of Israel, or animosity towards isolationist groups of wealthy Saudis (Jews, Russians, whoever) or revolutionary ire directed at the dominance of institutions by certain races (old, white, Anglo-Saxon ceos, for example) must all be understood as ‘racist’. Such misdirection is not difficult, as those who express their frustrations at privileged groups, or at immigrants shipped in by privileged groups to destabilise local workers, frequently make the same error (due either to the influence of media-enhanced availability errors or of genuine racists); as-suming that, for example, rich Brit is synonymous with Brit (or Professor is synonymous with White Man, or Bogan is synonymous with Australian).',\n",

The system is also quite comfortable with a ‘radical’ movement which requires a massive and powerful pyschocratic-punitive legal apparatus to make them ‘safe’ from ‘abuse’, from ‘hate speech,’ from various forms of ‘phobia’ (islamaphobia, transphobia, bipho-bia, etc.) and ‘mental illness’ and from catastrophic thought crimes which stand in for ‘all the things I don’t like’.

The modern leftist complains about ‘victim-blaming’ yet never criticises the system which relentlessly suppresses the idea that the environment causes conflict, crime, physical ill-health or outright madness. The modern leftist complains about ‘objectification’ yet sees the entire world and everyone in it as a collection of categories; you are not an individual, you are ‘white’ or ‘a man’.\\xa0The well-to-do leftist regularly expresses ‘sol-idarity’ [i.e. intense identification] with those most affected by the system (the global poor and excluded) while making demeaning professional interventions in their lives and patronising pronouncements about how they should resist the system. The modern leftist complains about ‘fragile egos,’ yet demonstrably possesses a self so extraordi-narily delicate and brittle, it can shatter at (be traumatised, triggered, even infected by) a word. The modern leftist complains about ‘being silenced,’ yet shuts down all criticism immediately and ferociously with arguments largely based on belittling inter-locutors, or ruling out their entire view based on a single piece of information, rather than on making a persuasive case. The reactive leftist regularly meets fact, knowledge and truth1 with feeling2 — ‘what you are saying is irrelevant, because it (it and noth-ing else; certainly not powerful social forces that stand to benefit from my feelings) makes me feel threatened, offended and angry; and because you do not belong to my category, you can never understand this feeling’ — a minority version of the standard mainstream position; reality is what we say it is3. The modern leftist has a great deal of difficulty speaking for himself; opinions are prefaced with ‘as a’ [homosexual, white man, a writer, a mammal]. The modern leftist believes himself to be cruelly abused, not just constantly harping on the actual insults he receives (‘see how awful they all are! look what names they call me!’) but constantly interpreting as derogatory ‘pretty much anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identified)’4. The institutional leftist believes herself to be a radical while aspiring to state control and professional advancement, regularly supporting centralised, hierarchical or artificially distributed power, happily working for a large corporation, or implicitly supporting apparently opposed ideologies (e.g. the absurd collusion between feminism and Islam). The postmodern leftist often claims that knowledge is a product of one’s race, privilege, gender and so on, yet demands that her intensely relative philosophy5 take first place on the institutional syllabus.

There is no fundamental difference, for example, between white supremacists and modern third-wave feminists. The identity is different, as is their proximity to state power, but the character is the same; absent, which is why the identity is clung to so desperately. Both modern leftists and rightists see the world as a collection of categories, both rely completely on the system and refuse to critically examine its foundations, both believe, despite ten thousand years of evidence to the contrary, that world-society can be controlled (through autocratic rightist edicts or rational leftist plans), both yearn for power, both are, in lieu of anything deeper than identity, extremely up-tight and, consequently, both fly off the handle when their identity, or the religious ideology that is based upon it, is intelligently criticised.

The entire purpose and meaning of management is to devise ways to counter such rebellion, to replace the people the system uses with machines, to make men and women satisfied with their alienated confinement, or, at the very least, unable to effectively resist it. And yet, still, periodically, even the most ‘efficient’ management system falters and the slaves threaten their masters — then it is time for reform.  Reform is the emergency mode of the capitalist system when faced with wide-spread radical opposition; a means of releasing the steam of revolutionary pressure without changing the mechanism which produces it. It comprises three stages, each of which is carried out with great fanfare; 1. Wave money. The simplest and, in the long run cheapest solution to discontent is to chuck a few more bananas at the monkeys. Most men and women will swallow their principles for a pay rise. 2. Grant limited or superficial reforms. The second stage is to make a few limited concessions, pass a few laws that ease the burden, allow clients to fill out complaint forms, put a comments section on the website and hand out a few upbeat stickers. 3. Grant temporary reforms. Finally, if nothing else works, give in and wait.

His attitude towards nature was domination, his attitude towards the peasantry and the urban poor was contempt1 and, crucially, his attitude towards an organised, central state was… that he was in favour of it. He simply added, to his con-tradictory declarations about the state, the proviso that it should eventually be run by workers and should vaguely aim to ‘wither away,’ meanwhile; ‘there can be no talk at present of achieving communism; the bourgeoisie must first come to the helm.’ Marx detested those who actively opposed the principle of statism (that is to say, anarchists) and who sought revolution beyond the authoritarian bounds2 of his vanguard; upon 1    The lumpenproletariat was his dismissive term for the latter; although he believed that all men were, faced with the ‘forces of history,’ dispensable.',\n",

Conscious being3 refers to the experience of consciousness that precedes, or is aware of, thoughts, emotions and separate sensations. This pristine sense of ‘I’ is occasionally sensed, or felt, after a long refreshing sleep, before all ‘my’ ideas slot into place, or in moments of stillness, when I am stunned by beauty or when, perhaps for no other reason than a walk in the park, I feel, all over my body, a profound rightness with life. Recognition, or knowing what is happening, takes me out of this experience into ideas, names, words and objects, which are all relative experiences; which is to say, known through relation and comparison. I know what the idea ‘The big cloud above me’ means by references to various relative scales, such as big-small, white-dark, fluffy-hard, above-below, here-there, and so on, but no such abstract knowledge is involved when the big cloud above is actually raining on me, or when I hug someone I am completely in love with, or in moments of sporting brilliance, when I am one with the ball, or after a hard day’s work when I step into the shower. Neither do I make relative assessments in moments of great shock, when I am stunned, by pain or loss or even embarrassment, into a full experience of what is. In such moments time seems to slow down and sensations become more vivid. This is because conscious being is not a mental event, located in the head, but a physical one. The entire body is conscious — an experience which we register as vivid, bright, intense, actual and full of meaning; while mind-made time, as we normally experience it, is a relative mode of experience which takes our attention away from the conscious body and into ideas of the past and the future.',\n",

They are all useful tools; indeed the first tools that humanity ever used. The problem appears, as with all tools, when they take control of the user. When woman can no longer experience her body directly without thinking, without feeling time press upon her, without a restless need to do or to buy something; when man cannot experience the present moment directly, when all experience comes via the thinking mind, when the strange, elusive intensity of life is instantly translated into comprehensible ideas, plans, desires and theories; then confu-1    We are not, therefore, talking here of rational, intellectual meaning. There’s certainly little of that in life.

This threat becomes greater with each successive generation. When the organs of the system — institutions — are still young and ‘within reach’ of those who created them, laws, habits and customs are still, at least partly, informed by the context; they are still relevant to society as it is, and those who created them still have some kind of power over them. But when a new generation appears, for whom institutional processes have become divorced from their original context, the ‘way it’s always been done’ on the one hand doesn’t seem to make so much sense, while, at the same time, through expansion and reinforcement, seems more real than it ever has. Key texts — once questionable and mutable — become fixed and sacred; pioneers — once human and responsive — become deified and beyond reproach; and, most insidiously, unspoken norms become reality itself, breach of which is perceived, by specialised elites now in charge of this objectified reality, as, at best, impudence, and in more serious cases, as sacrilege, madness.4',\n",

It is easy to instil compliance because, as the system evolves, the matrix of institutions5 which comprise it covers more and more aspects of life.

The system and the ego are so subtle and pervasive they often do not figure in anarchist literature at all (with the honourable exceptions of Lao Tzu2, Leo Tolstoy, William Blake, Henry Miller and Ivan Illich3). That anarchists ignore or support the coercive power of dominants, or that they — we — are often forced to compromise, does not make such support an anarchist position any more than some vegetarians having a crafty bacon sandwich makes eating pork a vegetarian position. Despite what anarchists may or may not think, it is indisputable that the seven dominants are coercive; that they control individuals, and nature, against their will. It is indisputable that kings coerce their subjects, that states do the same, and that posses-sion of property, financial wealth, the ability to write or manipulate laws, the strength of the majority, specialised, technical expertise, professional authority and systemic conformity all confer power to dominate — sometimes even domesticate — people. It is also indisputable that tools beyond a certain size and complexity enslave men and women and compel them to think, act and even feel in ways alien to their better nature; for them to serve the car, for example, or transport system, or the farm, or the school, rather than their own, or nature’s, instincts. Finally, it is indisputable that the restless mind and emotions take control of conscious experience and cause men and women to do, say, think and feel things they don’t really want to; cause them to hate, for example, get angry and depressed, or worry. ‘I’ may want to stop wanting and worrying, but, if I am honest I can see that ‘I’ am not in charge here.

This attitude, to people who have lived in dominating systems, seems strange to say the least.

The word ‘anarchy’ means, in the dictionaries of the system, disorder; despite the fact that actual anarchists, with a few insane exceptions, have never been opposed to order. The question which anarchists seek to ask is what order, or whose. Anarchists believe that the only society worth living in is based on some kind of natural order, that which nat-urally or intuitively regulates individual and collective life. For authoritarians this does not exist. They see no evidence of it. What they see in ‘intuition’ is erratic emotionality. What they see in nature is, principally at least, warfare, fear, pain, hierarchical struggle, pecking orders, alpha males and so on. For such people nature, and human nature, may contain organised elements, but the end result is a neverending, chaotic battle of all against all. Nature might be finely ordered, formally beautiful and good eating; but it cannot be trusted. To organise a society therefore must entail suppression and control of our natural instincts. Result; people become resentful, bored, stupid and violent… which is to say disordered.',\n",
       " '‘But look how neat everything is! Look how well your phone works! Look at how nicely tarmacked the m25 is’. One of the reasons it is hard to perceive the chaos of the system is that it is formally ordered. It all looks good — provided you look in the right place. Everything, for example, looks good on paper, because it is has been priority one for the system, since the invention of writing, to ensure that everything in heaven and earth is legible — capable of being named, measured, standardised and controlled. Everything also looks good when it is dead. A modern farm is the epitome of order because nothing lives on it but one, hyper-ordered crop bred to depend completely upon equally ordered synthetic inputs (the same applies to the modern city and the modern computer). Finally, everything looks good when you don’t have to pay attention to what isn’t so good. We do not have a direct relationship with our fellow humans, or fellow creatures, and so we are spared from perceiving the bedlam that reigns beyond the office (flat, farm, factory or shop). All important interactions go via the system, and so we do not have to deal with, or even perceive, the cause of our formal order (the actual lives of people who build our computers, for example, or the animals which fill our burgerbuns) or its effects (where our rubbish and shit actually go when we’re done with it). The people of the affluent West live in an antiseptic sphere of mini coopers, Dyson vacuums and self-service checkouts. Everything seems to us, just as it did to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who had no idea of the horror their comfortable lives were based on, so very nicely arranged.  We are confident in ourselves because we are confident in the safety and order of our surroundings; what lies outside the gates is not really worth paying serious attention to. We know that something is wrong out there, or we intuitively feel it, a distant rumble of thunder during the picnic, but it terrifies us, and so we turn to the consumption of reassuring neatness to push the anxiety away. Not that there is anything wrong with organising your record collection or cleaning your kitchen or collecting stamps or poring over maps; but that the system must manufacture toys which soothe the anxieties produced by the chaos which is the by-product of toys which soothe the anxieties produced by the chaos… of domination. Dominate the land with industrial technology, dominate the people with repressive laws, dominate your children with rigid ‘discipline’, dominate women with physical power or intellectual scheming, dominate your life with strict plans, goals and systems, dominate the darkness with 24/7 light; and what happens? On paper it all works out fine. In the real world domination produces chaos. Domination, however, is not the same as power or even authority. The ocean is powerful, but anarchists do not protest the tides. Likewise old people sometimes have, by virtue of their experience, immense authority; but only a fruitcake would oppose age on principle, or refuse to listen to its wisdom. There is a crucial difference — reflect-ed in our language — between being in authority and being an authority. In the first place your power comes from holding a position, which is, by definition, an inflexible role or rank, and in the second your power comes from being in a position to use your knowledge, experience or sensitivity; then, when the circumstance changes, the power evaporates, as of course it should. Fixing power into roles and ranks has the same effect as fixing names into titles, meanings into definitions and guidelines into laws; they become unable to respond to what is actually happening. Result: fabulous inefficiency and, once again, unmanageable chaos, as everyone knows who has worked in an organisation bound by titles, defini-tions, laws and fixed power. Those at the bottom actually facing the actual situation find they are unable to deal with it, while those at the top not only have no idea what the situation is, they are terrified by the power of those who can see what needs to be done, and fanatically suppress any attempts to use it.',\n",

Critics point out that, okay, tiny groups of pre-agricultural folk and minute radical outfits on the fringe might be able to handle life without coercive laws and the like, but how on earth are we to organise a global post-industrial society informally? We aren’t. It is impossible. A world such as we have cannot be run from the bottom up. What kind of world can emerge from anarchist principles is, however, an open ques-tion. Large-scale anarchist co-operation and free international exchange are perfectly feasible and would lead to an extraordinarily complex world; just not one overruled by czars, commissars, rigid plans and fixed laws. Anarchism, in fact, is no more antithetical to complex federations, than it is to leadership, authority and law. What it opposes, once again, is hierarchical control. Anarchist federations are, in fact, hierarchical;4 just extremely flat ones in which the power of the level above is zero; with those at the peak able to do little more than recommend and relay. This doesn’t mean they are ineffec-tive (as advisory bodies are in the system) any more than your grandmother is. As the influential anarchist Colin Ward has pointed out, the international postal service and railways are both massive anarchist structures, with no central control whatsoever, as 1  According to Woodcock in Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.',\n",

Certainly nothing like clinical depression, schizophrenia, psychopathy and so on. That humans were long-lived, healthy and happy is the consensus position amongst those who study ancient or primal people. There were problems of course, tensions, disagreements, even murders — and of course the wild is a brutally unsentimental companion — but in the absence of property, specialised power and whatnot, interpersonal problems could be dealt with. Likewise there were disagreements and doubts about what should be done, but these were not resolved by means of a vote which a minority was compelled to submit to; indeed very often they were not resolved explicitly at all2.

Despite the caricatures which critics invent (‘using a phone! what a hypocrite!’), anarcho-primitivism does not entail the ludicrous refusal of all technology (such as fire, pottery or even agriculture, which, incidentally, predates the horrors of state-run farms1) or demand anarcho-primitivists take off all their clothes and go and live in a tree; and it certainly doesn’t entail, as some critics like to believe, a recommendation for the exter-mination of mankind. It simply recognises that coercion and control run deeper than kings, parliaments and corporations pushing people around; that we are domesticated as much, if not more, by our tools2, as we are by those who have power over them, and that a functioning society must be based on the non-democratic egalitarianism, sensitivity and wildness of our ancestors.

Money supplies have dried up, police have vanished, governments have broken down and people have found that life has not just gone on as before, but has been far easier and more pleasant. Ordinarily this happens during a crisis, such as when the banks shut down in Ireland in 1970, or in the early days of the British, French, Russian, Chinese and Hungarian revolutions, in the spring days in Prague in 1968 and in the breakdown of communism in the former ussr, not to mention in the middle of natural catastrophes, when people have found, in spite of all the horrors that attended these events, collective intelligence, resourcefulness and conviviality. This has surprised them, just as it does us, who are used to seeing the breakdown of ‘society’ portrayed as brutal chaos. Such chaos does exist of course, but only when dominants still exist. It is not the absence of civilisation that causes riots and violence during times of social crisis, but its presence.

Self, in other words, becomes ego, a self-informed mental-emotional mechanism which accepts completely the system’s determinants of reality.

It is also why, paradoxically, genuinely liberating experiences do not merely amaze the mind and excite the heart, but baffle, delight and stun the natural body.
